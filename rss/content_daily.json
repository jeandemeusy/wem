    "7176b75a1631d255ea751b194687bf9b3af1e90d3cba8380d7786017": "A fearless badger is harassing passers-by at a renowned beauty spot -- leading the RSPCA to warn the public about its behaviour. Dog walkers, joggers and families out enjoying the countryside have all fallen foul of the black and white menace. The badger has been recorded prowling during the day in Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, and following two barking dogs who were being pulled away by their owner. Despite the mammals' typical nocturnal habits, this particular individual has been seen taking leisurely strolls in broad daylight. It has run up towards barking dogs without flinching and chased a French bulldog, which sought refuge behind its owner. The RSPCA has warned the public to keep their distance from the badger and said its actions are not normal for the normally shy species. It is unusually approachable towards humans and followed one female jogger over stepping stones of a nearby stream, before getting bored and turning back. Ben Clay, 39, who filmed the badger while out walking with his children, said: 'Someone walked past and said 'Keep your dog on the lead as there is a badger wandering about'. 'I just kept an eye on the children and then looked up and saw it trotting down the path.' He captured the video and posted it on social media later on that day, writing: 'Little badger came out to play at stepping stones in Cannock Chase.' The video gained more than 370,000 views and almost 1,300 comments from viewers who were shocked and concerned for the animal. Harris Dickenson said: 'Might be worth a report to the RSPCA, that is not normal behaviour.' Victoria Hedges said: 'That's not a good thing. That's either a sick badger or one that someone has hand raised and released for some insane reason.' Another commenter, Oli Bonell said: 'It's most probably riddled with TB acting like that in broad daylight and looks thin to me.' With Kath Gebski adding: 'Poor thing, clearly something is wrong with him..'  'Did he think the little dog was related to him?' Newman Kelly questioned. With Christopher Johnson adding: 'Showing who is boss, pleased no one got too close.' It is understood that the badger is now receiving care. The nocturnal creatures are rarely seen in the day and live in large family groups in burrows under the ground, known as a sett. Cubs are born in January or February but spend the first few months underground, only coming out in spring when it is a little warmer. In a statement, the RSPCA said: 'This is not normal behaviour for a badger, who are nocturnal and wouldn't usually be seen in open daylight walking amongst people. 'The RSPCA would advise that if anyone sees this badger - or any other - behaving like this, to keep a distance, and to keep dogs well away. 'It may well be disoriented and could be unpredictable and aggressive. 'If you see a badger you have concerns about please call the RSPCA's emergency line on 0300 1234 999.'",

Gregory Doran, who has been in charge of the organisation since 2012 and is now set to leave the RSC, said it was no longer accepted to not cast a disabled person in the role.   Richard III who is referred to in the Shakespeare play as 'cheated of feature' and 'unfinished' is traditionally played with a hunchback or cane. Mr Doran's late husband, Anthony Sher, gave several performances in the role - using a crutch - in a 1984 Royal Shakespeare Company performance in Stratford-Upon-Avon. However, speaking to the Times in his first interview since his husband's death, he said Sher's performance would 'no longer be acceptable'.  There has been an ongoing debate whether abled bodied actors should play disabled characters with Eddie Redmayne facing criticism for playing Stephen Hawking.  Mr Doran compared the casting of disabled actors as Richard III to the casting of black actors as Othello.  He said: 'Tony's performance now would probably not be acceptable. 'It's the Othello syndrome isn't it? That moment when white actors stopped thinking of Othello in their repertoire, because it was not acceptable to have blackface any more, at least until the level playing field is achieved.  'It's the same with disabled actors and Richard.' The Royal Shakespeare Company has now chosen a disabled actor to play Richard III for the first time.  Arthur Hughes who is playing the Richard III in the upcoming production has already said it is 'problematic in many ways' for able bodied actors to take on disabled roles.  He told the Guardian: 'It's not to say [able bodied] people can never play these parts. But I think it's time that we had that lived experience shown properly.'   But Four Weddings and a Funeral actor Simon Callow told the Times in 2019 he was a big fan of diversity but to use the theatre for that purpose would 'diminish' it.  Mr Callow sarcastically claimed he would need to withdraw from playing all 37 characters of a Christmas Carol, including Tiny Tim as he was not able bodied or fat man as he is a thin actor.  He said: 'Clearly, the reductio ad absurdum is that you can't play Macbeth unless you're a Scottish king, and everybody understands that isn't the point.' In 2019, Scope said it's 'disappointing that a disabled actor' was not cast as the Elephant Man.  And in response to Mr Callow, Phil Talbot, head of communications at Scope, said its 'not a terrible trouble with us' but said disabled actors face barriers.   It was confirmed in 2012 that the real Plantagenet King Richard III had a curvature of the spine, although rumours of a withered arm have not been verified form the bones found in the Leicester car park in 2012.  Mr Doran will finish his chair of the RSC with the only Shakespeare play he has not directed, Cymbeline, and was going to retire in 2023 but said Sher's death from cancer has been a factor in his decision to leave the post earlier.",
    "0937fbd5224a394485c563de213dae0d4af8abb419a19497693203c0": "Sir Keir Starmer's Labour have seized control of Tory strongholds in London including the totemic Conservative authority in Wandsworth and have won Westminster for the first time since its creation in 1964 as the party strengthens its grip on the capital. Labour also snapped up Barnet, which has a large Jewish population and which will be seen as a sign the party has turned the corner on the anti-Semitism rows which dogged Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. Perhaps the biggest blow to Boris Johnson's Tories will be Wandsworth, which turned blue in 1978 - a year before Margaret Thatcher's election as prime minister and was reputedly her favourite council, noted for its low taxes. A Tory source conceded 'we expect these elections to be tough'. A triumphalist Sadiq Khan said that 'history has been made' as the London Mayor celebrated the victory in the early hours of Friday morning.  Two other London councils - Croydon and Tower Hamlets - are not due to declare until the early hours of Saturday morning and Saturday evening respectively.  Conservative Holds: Broxbourne, Thurrock, Nuneaton & Bedworth, Epping Forest, Basildon, Rochford, Brentwood, Harlow, Rushmoor, Redditch, Fareham, Amber Valley, North East Lincolnshire, Tamworth, Dudley, Bexley, Hillingdon Losses: Worcester (to no overall control), Wandsworth (to Labour), Southampton (to Labour), West Oxfordshire (to NOC), Barnet (to Labour) Labour Gains: Cumberland (from NOC), Wandsworth (from Tories), Southampton (from Tories), Barnet (from Tories) Holds: Sunderland, Halton, South Tyneside, Chorley, Tameside, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sefton, Stevenage, Lincoln, Sandwell, Exeter, Ipswich, Wigan, Coventry, Salford, North Tyneside, Preston, Oldham, Waltham Forest, Wolverhampton, Barnsley, Ealing, Barking & Dagenham, Redbridge Loss: Kingston-upon-Hull (to Lib Dems) Lib Dems Gain: Kingston-upon-Hull (from Labour) Hold: Eastleigh   What other results are expected and when? Around 9am: Counting begins for a further 71 councils in England and all councils in Scotland and Wales.  But elsewhere, Labour lost Hull to Sir Ed Davey's resurgent Liberal Democrats. It was a similar story for the Green Party who chipped away at Conservative and Labour seats in England. The under-fire Prime Minister is now facing a backlash from local Tory leaders as his party lost major London authorities to Labour and suffered setbacks across England to Sir Keir's party. Conservatives have blamed the Partygate drama for the party's electoral losses overnight, with John Mallinson, leader of Carlisle City Council, urging backbenchers to write to Sir Graham Brady to trigger a vote of no-confidence against Mr Johnson after Labour took control of Cumberland. Mid-term elections are always difficult for a governing party, although as many of the English seats were last contested in 2018 during Theresa May's chaotic administration, opportunities for opposition parties to make further gains may be limited. Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis insisted Mr Johnson remained the right person to lead the party, amid speculation that a bad set of election results - coupled with any further revelations about No 10 lockdown-busting parties - could see more Tory MPs submitting letters of no confidence. The Northern Ireland Secretary told Sky News: 'I absolutely think we can win the next election, and I do think Boris Johnson is the right person to lead us into that.' Policing minister Kit Malthouse told the BBC: 'The further away you get from London, our sense is that the picture is better for us.' Labour's campaign has been hit by Tory calls for Durham Police to look into whether Sir Keir broke Covid rules while campaigning before the 2021 Hartlepool by-election - something he has dismissed as 'mudslinging'. The Tories have also complained about a secret pact between Labour and the Lib Dems to maximise Conservative pain in marginal seats, something denied by both opposition parties. While Labour enjoyed success in London, there was a mixed picture elsewhere - with the loss of Hull blamed on local issues but the party insisting it was winning back support in Brexit-supporting areas. Shabana Mahmood, Labour's national campaign co-ordinator, said it was a 'turning point' for the party. 'After the disastrous results of 2019, these early results are showing the progress we have made thanks to Keir's leadership. Labour is making headway in England, Scotland and Wales, taking over key Conservative councils and winning in vital Parliamentary battlegrounds across the country,' she said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth acknowledged there was a mountain to climb for the party following the 2019 general election. 'It's climbable, but my god it's a big mountain because we got an absolute hammering in 2019, the worst result since the 1930s,' he told the BBC. On a tumultuous night in British politics:  A council leader has resigned from the Conservative Party after accusing the government of 'ignoring' his county. Oliver Hemsley says he will continue leading Rutland County Council as an independent after announcing his resignation from the Conservative Group shortly after local election polls closed. Mr Hemsley said inequalities in Rutland have been 'compounded year-on-year' because of council tax and accused the government of 'ignoring and sidelining' the council despite repeated requests for help. The next elections for Rutland County Council won't take place until next year, though the Lib Dems won one seat being contested on Thursday. Meanwhile, Marc Bayliss, the Tory leader of Worcester City Council, told reporters he was heading home early from the election count and is anticipating a disastrous night for his party. Mr Bayliss blamed partygate and said the public had found the government's performance 'wanting'. He added: 'I think it is fair to say we are having a bad night.' His comments were echoed by the leader of the Conservatives on Sunderland Council, Antony Mullen, who called for Boris Johnson to step down. The Liberal Democrats focused on making further inroads in Tory heartlands - the 'Blue Wall' in southern England - following recent Westminster by-election successes in North Shropshire and Chesham and Amersham. Party leader Sir Ed Davey said: 'I am optimistic that thanks to their hard work, the Liberal Democrats will gain ground in areas across the Blue Wall where voters are fed up of being taken for granted by the Conservatives.' The new Labour leader of Wandsworth council said his party's victory signalled it was 'time for change' at the top of the Government. Wandsworth's new Labour leader Simon Hogg said: 'We are going to build a compassionate council that truly listens and keep that same low council tax. 'But when we were calling around on voters we didn't even have to raise partygate, we didn't have to mention Boris Johnson. People have formed their own views on this Government, so I am afraid it is time for change at the top as well.' London's Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan said that 'history has been made' with the Labour victory in Wandsworth. Ravi Govindia, leader of the Wandsworth Tories, said: 'Let's not be coy about it, of course national issues were part of the dilemma people were facing.' After results were declared from 53 councils, the Tories had lost control of two authorities and were down 55 councillors, Labour had a net gain of one council and 21 councillors, the Lib Dems had one authority and 31 more seats while the Greens had put on 19 councillors. Wandsworth boasts one of the lowest average council tax rates in England, with Boris Johnson pointing to the low rates as an example of Conservative party competence in local office. A Labour party source described the loss as 'monumental' for the Conservatives. 'This was the Tories' jewel in the crown,' they added. The borough's new Labour leader Simon Hogg promised to 'build a compassionate council that truly listens, and keep that same low council tax'. He added: 'When we were calling around on voters we didn't even have to raise partygate, we didn't have to mention Boris Johnson. People have formed their own views on this Government, so I am afraid it is time for change at the top as well.' Barnet council has only ever been in Conservative control since it was created in 1964. In 2014, Labour came close to gaining control, but the Tories retained a narrow majority. In 2018 the gap between the ruling Conservatives and the Labour opposition widened, with concern among the north London borough's large Jewish population about the Labour antisemitism scandal cited as a reason. Ahead of the result, leader of the Labour group on Barnet council Barry Rawlings told the BBC: 'I've been feeling confident for a while, I think we've had a very good campaign, got good candidates, it feels good on the streets.' He said the 'stain' of anti-Semitism had been removed from the party under Sir Keir, who launched his party's London election campaign in Barnet. Conceding defeat, the Conservative leader of Barnet, Daniel Thomas, said Labour's gain was a 'warning shot' from Tory voters. He added: 'Clearly if Labour are to get a majority in Parliament they need to win Barnet. They won the council, if they win our parliamentary constituencies as well, then it doesn't bode well for us to form a Government in future general elections.' Westminster City Council had been in Conservative hands since the authority was created in 1964. The symbolically-important council oversees local services on Parliament's doorstep. The Conservative party also lost several seats in Hillingdon, the borough which covers Boris Johnson's Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency, although it retained control of the council. In Richmond, the Tories won only one seat on the newly redrawn council, with the Liberal Democrats winning the majority.",
    "0c0f7e1714207c104a7fe449ac0b3558b18009d3766d4255e256bcd0": "Labour will be 'somewhat disappointed' by their local election results, elections expert John Curtice said today - with Keir Starmer's party sweeping up London but making only modest gains elsewhere. Professor Curtice said the Tories looked on track to lose between 200 and 300 seats amid anger over sleaze and Partygate, but Labour were struggling in its former Red Wall seats. He said it was not a performance 'that indicated a party that is on course for winning a general election with a majority' and did not even suggest Labour would necessarily be the largest party in the next Parliament. Labour has seized three symbolic London councils from the Conservatives - Westminster, Barnet and Wandsworth.  While Southampton has switched to Labour, the party is struggling to make ground elsewhere, and lost Hull to the Lib Dems after more than a decade in power.  Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, said the outcome showed that voters still do not think Labour 'has all the answers'.   'People are feeling like the Tories are not answering their needs, they are not dealing with the real core issues where you can't pay your bills, are not sure how you are going to get through the next year,' she told the BBC.  'Now I admit that if, so far, we had taken all of those councils, that would mean that they were saying we did have all the answers. We have got work to do.' Conservative Holds: Broxbourne, Thurrock, Nuneaton & Bedworth, Epping Forest, Basildon, Rochford, Brentwood, Harlow, Rushmoor, Redditch, Fareham, Amber Valley, North East Lincolnshire, Tamworth, Dudley, Bexley, Hillingdon Losses: Worcester (to no overall control), Wandsworth (to Labour), Westminster (to Labour), Southampton (to Labour), West Oxfordshire (to NOC), Barnet (to Labour) Labour Gains: Cumberland (from NOC), Wandsworth (from Tories), Southampton (from Tories), Barnet (from Tories) Holds: Sunderland, Halton, South Tyneside, Chorley, Tameside, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sefton, Stevenage, Lincoln, Sandwell, Exeter, Ipswich, Wigan, Coventry, Salford, North Tyneside, Preston, Oldham, Waltham Forest, Wolverhampton, Barnsley, Ealing, Barking & Dagenham, Redbridge Loss: Kingston-upon-Hull (to Lib Dems) Lib Dems Gain: Kingston-upon-Hull (from Labour) Hold: Eastleigh   What other results are expected and when? Around 9am: Counting begins for a further 71 councils in England and all councils in Scotland and Wales. Giving his analysis of Labour's performance, Professor Curtice said: 'Outside of London, as compared to 2018 when these seats were last contested, it looks like their seats are down slightly.  'And for a party that is trying to regain ground in the so-called Red Wall seats in the Midlands and north of England, this wasn't quite the progress they wanted. 'There is still a very substantial legacy of the impact of Brexit on both the character of the Conservative and Labour supporters. 'The Conservatives are still much stronger in Leave areas, and therefore Labour is still struggling to make more progress there. Wandsworth - seen as the Tory's flagship council - has been Tory since 1978, and Westminster since 1964. Labour's success in Barnet, which has a large Jewish population, will be seen as a sign the party has turned the corner on the anti-Semitism rows which dogged Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. Sir Keir described Labour's gains as 'absolutely brilliant' and a 'big turning point' for the party. Speaking to Labour campaigners in Barnet, he says: 'We've changed Labour and now we're seeing the results of that.'  However, the leader of the Labour group of Barnet council, said this was less of a reflection on enthusiasm for his party and more a reflection of disillusionment with the Tories. Barry Rawlings told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I'll be honest, it's not us being wonderful. 'I think a lot of Conservatives haven't voted this time, I think they feel alienated from No 10 and that they are, I don't know, they've been disappointed with Boris Johnson and so not voting and I think that's made a difference as well.' The Conservatives are downplaying Labour's wins, saying that the party has 'gone backwards' outside of London. But privately they are conceding that it has been a 'difficult night' for the Conservatives in the capital. A Tory source told Politico: 'Outside London, this is now looking like a bad night for Labour across the rest of the country. 'They have gone backwards in places like Sunderland, Tyneside, Hartlepool, Nuneaton, Sandwell and Amber Valley, showing they are seriously underperforming in former Labour heartlands which they need to regain.'  However, Barnet Conservative leader Daniel Thomas said Labour's victory in the London borough 'does not bode well' for the Tories ahead of the next general election. 'I think this is a warning shot from Conservative supporters and I think our loss today is not only due to the fact that I have just mentioned but also a fair number of Conservative voters who just didn't go out to vote, stayed at home,' he said. 'Clearly if Labour are to get a majority in Parliament they need to win Barnet. They won the council, if they win our parliamentary constituencies as well.' With voters shunning both Labour and the Tories, the Lib Dems and Greens are emerging as the biggest winners from the local elections.  The Lib Dems have added more than 50 councillors to their tally and seized control of Kingston-Upon-Hull authority from Labour. They made inroads against the Conservatives in West Oxfordshire and Stockport. For their part, the Greens have racked up an extra 20-plus seats.  Professor Curtice said the Lib Dems were 'the surprise of tonight'. 'In terms of share of the vote, the progress is relatively modest, but they might just be hoping they are finally demonstrating some recovery from the 2015 general election,' he told the BBC. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said: 'There is now a real picture emerging across the country, particularly in areas held by the Conservatives, that the Lib Dems are the real challengers.'  Today, Labour blamed their loss of control of Hull after more than a decade in power on a collapse of the Tory vote which moved to the Lib Dems. Labour's outgoing council leader Daren Hale said his party lost its slender majority in the city due to a total collapse of the last vestiges of Conservative support in key wards of the city. The Lib Dems saw a net gain of three seats in Hull, leaving them with 29 seats on the 57-seat council, compared with 27 for Labour and one independent. The Conservatives lost their last remaining seat on the council to Labour. Asked whether the result was a reflection of Labour's national profile, Mr Hale told BBC Radio Humberside: 'In the seats we held, our majority went up. 'It was the collapse of the Tory vote which, in a sense the Labour Party isn't responsible for, that led to those seats changing hands. So, I think it would be too premature to make those judgments.' Local issues around disruptive road building projects and policies over buses and cycles have been cited as key areas of concern for voters in Hull. Mr Hale said local Lib Dem councillors are at odds with the national party over bus and cycle lane policies. He said: 'There's no hiding place now. I look forward to all the roadworks being completed in the middle of the night by magic pixies with no disruption to the public but we will see, won't we?' And he added: 'We will dust ourselves down and we will come back.' ",

Unlike in some places in the rest of the UK where votes were counted overnight, ballots are being tallied up in Scotland throughout Friday and the final results are due to be announced in the early evening. Results in England have so far been positive for Labour, with the party increasing its number of seats by 34 - while the Tories dropped 122. Senior figures in the Scottish Conservatives have told The Times they are expecting 'heavy losses' due to the partygate saga, which saw the Prime Minister, his wife and Chancellor Rishi Sunak fined by police. But former Tory MSP Adam Tomkins described that comment as 'nonsense'. He highlighted that Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross had backed Boris Johnson to remain in post at Number 10. On Twitter, Mr Tomkins said: 'Whatever today's results show Douglas Ross owns this, not Boris. 'It was Douglas who U-turned, Douglas who flipped, and Douglas who backed the PM. He and his team need to own the consequences, not pass the buck.' The Greens are hoping for a big 'breakthrough' at the next general election, the party leader has said.  Adrian Ramsay told Sky News' Kay Burley: 'What we've seen is three elections in a row where we've substantially increased our number of councillors to record numbers, so Greens winning under the first past the post voting system.' He said that in areas with 'big concentrations of Green councillors' - Bristol, Sheffield, Herefordshire and Suffolk - the party will 'be working to make (a) breakthrough in the general election.' Mr Ramsay also said they could gain Westminster seats in both Labour and Tory areas. 'Absolutely that's what we will be moving forward to do,' he added. Labour's national campaign co-ordinator has claimed the party would win Red Wall seats at a general election if the share of the vote in the local elections was replicated. Shabana Mahmood MP told LBC Radio: 'If you look at what's happening in the popular vote - the aggregate vote share as it's known in these local elections - actually we would be winning parliamentary seats such as Workington, we would be winning in Copeland, we'd be winning back Hartlepool, Carlisle, Great Grimsby, Leigh, two seats in Wolverhampton, two seats in West Brom. 'That's a lot of Tory MPs that would be losing their seats to the Labour Party in the next general election.' The Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood also said Labour made gains in the local elections because it offered an alternative on the cost of living. 'I think it is the cost-of-living crisis that is the key issue facing every household in the country - that is the issue on which the Conservative Party and Boris Johnson in particular have failed to offer anything to the voters of this country,' she said. 'And I think the Labour Party has had a solid showing in the results that we've seen coming in so far in these local elections because we've had an alternative to offer.' She added she is 'quite happy for them (the Conservatives) to steal our ideas and make them law'. Labour's Merton Council leader Mark Allison has failed to win re-election. Mr Allison came in behind Lib Dem candidate Kirsten Galea and Labour's deputy council leader Eleanor Stringer. He had been been the leader of the council since November 2020. Counting is still underway in Merton, where Labour look set to retain control of the council it has held since 2014. Theresa May's former No10 chief of staff Nick Timothy has called the local elections a 'none of the above' result. Taking to Twitter, he said Labour has not made headway outside London and 'doesn't resemble a party heading for majority government'. He added: 'The Tories have done worse this time than they did at May's (almost) lowest ebb in 2018'. Sir Keir Starmer has said that Labour has moved past the anti-Semitism row which dogged the party under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. He made the comments while addressing Labour supporters at Barnet, which has a significant Jewish population. 'My first words as leader of our party, when I took over in April 2020, was that we were going to root out anti-Semitism from our party, not tolerate it any more in our party, change our party. 'I said the test of that will be whether voters trust us again in places like Barnet, and they've done it. That is your hard work, that is the change we've collectively brought about in our Labour Party, the trust that we're building, putting us on the road to Number 10, on the road to that general election. 'That change these last two years has been really hard for us as a party, but we've done it, we've built those solid foundations, we've won here in Barnet, we've won across London, we're winning from coast to coast.' - England We should get all council results by 8pm.  - Scotland and Wales We should get the first results from Scotland and Wales - and from the handful of mayoral contests that are happening in England - from 12pm. By late afternoon or early evening, full results in Scotland and Wales are expected. - Northern Ireland Full results in Northern Ireland are expected by around 2am on Saturday morning. If it overruns, the count will then pick up again from 9am.  The Conservative Party chairman claimed he has never bought a tin of beans. Oliver Dowden was being quizzed on LBC on the price of supermarket own-brand goods, after Environment Secretary George Eustice was rounded on by political rivals and social commentators this week for suggesting consumers should swap to value brands as the cost of living continues to bite. Mr Dowden said: 'I'm afraid I rarely get the opportunity to go to the shops, given my extensive duties as chairman of the Conservative Party, but when I pop down to my local Tesco's, of course I buy own-brand products. 'I wouldn't know the price of a tin of baked beans - I'll tell you why, I have never liked baked beans. I've never purchased a tin of baked beans in my entire life.' He got the price of a pint of milk about right, guessing at 'around 50p'. Labour will be 'somewhat disappointed' by their local election results, elections expert John Curtice said today - with Keir Starmer's party sweeping up London but making only modest gains elsewhere. Professor Curtice said the Tories looked on track to lose between 200 and 300 seats amid anger over sleaze and Partygate, but Labour were struggling in its former Red Wall seats.

'The Conservatives are still much stronger in Leave areas, and therefore Labour is still struggling to make more progress there.' Labour has won the first of two new Cumbria councils home to the so-called 'Workington Man'. The new Cumberland authority will cover Copeland, Allerdale and Carlisle from April 1, 2023. Labour won 30 of the 46 seats with the Conservatives getting seven, Liberal Democrats four, Greens two and three independents. It is a big result because it is part of Labour's so-called Red Wall snatched up by the Tories in 2019. It is home to the 'Workington Man' archetypal swing voter, which some say won the Conservatives the last general election. The result also means that Labour will be in charge of a whole range of local services until 2027. Ex-Carlisle City Council Conservative leader John Mallinson blamed Partygate for the result. Morning to all of you who are now joining MailOnline's local elections live blog. It's been a big night for British politics, with Boris Johnson looking safe but Tories blaming losses on the 'mid-term blues' and Labour failing to topple the so-called Red Wall. The biggest disappointments for the Conservatives in London are Wandsworth, Westminster and Barnet, which have all turned red. Tory grandees have called these losses 'catastrophic', as these authorities were held by the party even during Blair's time in power. A triumphalist Sir Keir Starmer claimed that Labour is 'back on track' in an address to supporters at Barnet.  But pollsters have said that Labour still can't win the next general election based on the results so far, as they have not yet made significant ground in the so-called Red Wall seats snatched by the Tories in 2019. Labour managed to retain Sunderland, but lost Hull to the Lib Dems in what Sir Ed Davey called a 'historic' series of wins. He has even rubbished suggestions that this was a protest vote, calling it a 'real trend'. The Greens likewise have claimed that they now present an alternative to the establishment parties.  The Prime Minister's ministers are today downplaying the significance of their losses as local Tories blame Partygate for the defeats. Results are due later today from most of the remaining councils in England along with every council in Scotland and Wales. Meanwhile vote counting has started in Northern Ireland, with the first of the 90 MLAs expected to be returned by Friday afternoon. In other developments:  - Labour gained Southampton from the Conservatives. - The Tories lost Worcester to no overall control. - The Conservatives lost West Oxfordshire, which contains David Cameron's former Witney constituency, to no overall control. - Voters in Bristol decided to abolish the post of mayor in a referendum. - In Rutland, where there was not even an election, council leader Oliver Hemsley quit the Conservative group. - Votes will start to be counted later in more counties in England, Scotland and Wales. - In Northern Ireland, counting has begun to decide on the make-up of the Stormont Assembly, with Sinn Fein vying with the DUP to become the largest party. Labour has blamed their loss of control of Hull after more than a decade in power on a collapse of the Tory vote which moved to the Lib Dems. Labour's outgoing council leader Daren Hale said his party lost its slender majority in the city due to a total collapse of the last vestiges of Conservative support in key wards of the city.

Local issues around disruptive road building projects and policies over buses and cycles have been cited as key areas of concern for voters in Hull. Mr Hale said local Lib Dem councillors are at odds with the national party over bus and cycle lane policies. He said: 'There's no hiding place now. I look forward to all the roadworks being completed in the middle of the night by magic pixies with no disruption to the public but we will see, won't we?' And he added: 'We will dust ourselves down and we will come back.' Hull's Lib Dem leader Mike Ross told the BBC: 'There's obviously issues around the road network. But there is also, fundamentally, the fact that people feel failed by a Labour council after over a decade - one that seems to have refused to listen to what the residents of Hull want. 'We want to be a council leadership that puts the people's priorities ahead of everything else and deliver what the residents of Hull want to see happen.' Asked about transport policy in the city, Mr Ross said: 'There is no difference between us and the national party in terms of the ambition. 'Of course, we want to see more people using bikes and other forms of transport to cars. 'But we also need to recognise that the way we go about getting that is really very important and there are concerns that we had a council that just seemed to impose these changes on the public of Hull and didn't take account of whether these were the right things to do or not before doing it.' Sir Ed Davey said that the party's gains at the local elections reflect a 'real trend'. The Lib Dem leader told Sky News: 'Last year we took Chesham and Amersham in true Blue Buckingham, a parliamentary by election, then we took North Shropshire... and we have had several years now of really good local election results. 'This isn't a one off. This is a real trend.' Conservative MP David Simmonds said Boris Johnson has some 'difficult questions' to answer after the party's losses in the local elections. The MP for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner said voters were unhappy about the disclosures over lockdown parties in Downing Street and Whitehall. 'It was a pretty clear message on the doorstep. Clearly the Prime Minister has got some difficult questions to answer,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 'Overwhelmingly the message that I heard on the doorsteps was people were broadly positive about the Government's policies but they are not happy about what they have been hearing about partygate. 'He said, 'I will take full responsibility for these election results', and I think he needs to confront that question now.' Sir Keir Starmer described the party's gains in Barnet as 'fantastic' and has said the party is 'back on track'. The Labour leader met supporters in north London on Friday morning where he celebrated the party's win from the Conservatives. Sir Keir said: 'This is a big turning point for us. From the depths of 2019 in that general election, back on track, winning in the north. Cumberland! Southampton! We've changed Labour and now we're seeing the results of that.' He added: 'What brilliant teams we've got, all the fantastic work we've put in. 'When it comes to London, you can hardly believe those names come off our lips. Wandsworth! They've been saying for years 'You'll never take Wandsworth from us.' We've just done it! Westminster! It's an astonishing result.' A Green victory in South Tyneside has come 'out of nowhere', one pollster has said. Britain Elects co-founder Ben Walker shared a graphic showing how the party snatched Cleadon and East Boldon from the Tories. The Greens are claiming that their wins in England prove they are an 'alternative' to the establishment parties.  Oliver Dowden said people have had enough of 'distraction from Westminster' when quizzed about voters' concerns during the local elections campaign. The Conservative Party chairman told BBC Breakfast: 'I do accept that this election has been fought against a difficult backdrop, and I think what I take from this election and what the Government needs to take, is that people are fed up with all the distraction from Westminster and they want us to focus on what's going on in their lives, and particularly at a time when we have this global challenge caused by both the crisis in Ukraine, and as we come out of Covid, of rapidly rising inflation and you saw that just yesterday, the cost of living, people want us to take focus and take action in respect of those things'. Sir Keir Starmer has claimed the local elections are a 'big turning point' for Labour. He said the results 'sent a message to the Prime Minister that Britain deserves better' as he thanked the Labour team in Barnet for its efforts. Labour took control of Barnet as well as Wandsworth and Westminster last night. Oliver Dowden has said that 'no government is going to be able to buy people out of all of these problems'. He told BBC Breakfast: 'It's not going to be possible, but we have taken unprecedented action'. The Conservative Party chairman also said: 'You would expect when people are hurting - and I know people are hurting and I hear this on the doorstep and we all see it and I know your viewers will feel the same way - they're sat around the kitchen table or in the front room thinking 'how are we paying those bills?'. 'It's incumbent on the Government to look to see every further measure that we can take but what I would say is that we've already taken an unprecedented amount of action'. Results are due later today from most of the remaining councils in England along with every council in Scotland and Wales. The Greens are hoping to make gains in Conservative-controlled Solihull, while Labour aims to do likewise in Tory-run Walsall. Two key councils in West Sussex are due to declare: Worthing, a top Labour target, and Crawley, where both the Tories and Labour are hoping to gain control. The SNP is looking to hold off any sign of a Labour resurgence in Glasgow and the outcome in Aberdeenshire will be a key measure of Conservative support in Scotland. In Wales, Labour is defending a slim majority in Cardiff and looking to take control of Blaenau Gwent from a group of independents, while Flintshire is a test of Tory popularity in an area in which they did well at the 2019 general election. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are fighting for control of the new unitary authority in Somerset, while the the Lib Dems hope to strengthen control of St Albans and cause an upset in Tory-run Gosport. Two councils in London - Croydon and Tower Hamlets - are not due to declare until the early hours of Saturday morning and Saturday evening respectively. - Westminster (LABOUR WIN) Westminster had been run by the Conservatives continuously since the council was created in 1964. Now it is in Labour hands - an outcome not predicted by many, but one that symbolises the slump in Tory support in the capital. - Wandsworth (LABOUR WIN) Wandsworth is a long-standing Labour target in London and this year the party has finally won power from the Conservatives, who had been in control of the council since 1978 and had prided themselves on charging residents one of the lowest average levels of council tax in the country. - Sunderland (LABOUR HOLD) A poor performance by Labour might have seen the party lose overall control at Sunderland, a council it has run since 1973. But Labour kept its majority and lost just one seat, to the Liberal Democrats, who also gained a second seat from the Conservatives. - Cumberland (LABOUR WIN) Labour has won a comfortable majority in the newly-created authority of Cumberland, which covers the former districts of Allerdale, Carlisle and Copeland in Cumbria - all areas currently represented by Conservative MPs. - Nuneaton & Bedworth (LABOUR HOLD) Labour saw its majority at Nuneaton & Bedworth disappear in 2018 and the party lost more councillors in 2021, with the Conservatives taking overall control. This year Labour has lost another seat to the Tories, in a part of the country that will be a key battleground at the next general election. - Hull (LIB DEM WIN) The Liberal Democrats have gained a wafer-thin majority in Hull, dislodging Labour who had run the council since 2011. The new line-up is 29 Lib Dems, 27 Labour and one independent - but no Conservatives. - Derby (TORIES HOLD) Labour hoped to close the gap on the Conservatives in Derby, where the council has been in no overall control since 2018. But while the party has made three gains, it is still behind the Tories who now have 18 seats, with Labour on 16, the Lib Dems eight, Reform six and independents three. - Southampton (LABOUR WIN) This was another top Labour target and the party has won control back from the Conservatives, though it has a slim majority on the new council of just four seats. - Bolton (TORIES HOLD) Labour had hoped for signs of progress in Bolton, Greater Manchester, a council where they enjoyed a majority until 2019. But while the party has gained two seats this time, the Conservatives also made a gain and remain the largest party with 23 councillors, ahead of Labour's 19, 13 independents and five Liberal Democrats. - Worcester (NO MAJORITY) Worcester has see-sawed since 2000 between having a Conservative majority and being in no overall control. The opposition parties were hoping to make gains this year and they have done just enough to leave Tories without a majority, with one gain for Labour and two for the Greens. - Barnet (LABOUR WIN) It is third time lucky for Labour in Barnet, which has been the party's top London target in the last three local elections. The party failed narrowly to win control in 2014, while 2018 saw the council swing further towards the Conservatives. This time Labour has won a hefty majority of 19. Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden downplayed Conservative losses and Labour gains in the local elections. He told BBC Breakfast: 'Of course we've had some difficult results and you can see that in London. 'I would say, though, that we are mid-term and it's quite a mixed picture because you look elsewhere, whether that's in Hartlepool or Nuneaton and Thurrock, we've actually made gains and I think if you take the whole picture of this, it really doesn't demonstrate that Labour has the momentum to form the next government'. He also said: 'This isn't like what Tony Blair got in say '95 two years before his election victory, they were making 1,800 gains. If you look at Ed Miliband (he) managed to make 800 gains in 2011 and still not win the election'. The counting of votes has started following elections to the Stormont Assembly. The DUP and Sinn Fein are vying for top spot, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister.  The first of the 90 MLAs are expected to be returned by Friday afternoon but the counting is set to continue into the early hours of Saturday. Some 239 candidates are running across 18 constituencies. The first stage of the counts, taking place at centres in Belfast, Jordanstown and Magherafelt, will include an announcement on total votes polled and percentage turnout. An indicative voter turnout of around 54% was given by the Electoral Office of Northern Ireland at 9pm on Thursday. They said the figure was based on the average of returns from polling stations which remained open until 10pm. The indicative turnout ranged from 60% in West Belfast to 47% in the South Antrim constituency. The turnout at the last Assembly election in 2017 was 64.8%. A unionist party has always been the biggest in the Assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of the state in 1921. While the office of the first and deputy first minister is an equal one with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. The Northern Ireland Protocol has cast a long shadow over the election campaign following the resignation of First Minister Paul Givan in February in an effort to force the UK Government to act over the post-Brexit trading arrangements. This action left the Executive unable to fully function. While ministers remained in post, they were restricted in the actions they could take. Unionists object to the additional checks on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain as a border in the Irish Sea. Five Assembly seats are up for grabs in 18 constituencies. Northern Ireland uses the single transferable vote (STV) proportional representation electoral system. The DUP won 28 seats at the last Assembly elections in 2017, just ahead of Sinn Fein which returned 27 MLAs. Next was the SDLP with 12 seats, the Ulster Unionist Party with 10 seats, Alliance with eight seats, the Green Party with two seats while People Before Profit and the TUV had one MLA each. This year, the DUP has been regarded as playing it safe, running 30 candidates, while Sinn Fein is running 34. Meanwhile, the UUP is running 27 candidates, the Alliance Party is running 24, the SDLP is fielding 22, TUV is putting up 19 candidates, the Green Party is running 18 and People Before Profit 12, as is Aontu, while the Workers Party is running six candidates and the PUP three. The Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP) and the Socialist Party are each fielding two candidates while the Northern Ireland Conservatives, Cross Community Labour Alliance (CCLA), Resume NI and Heritage Party are each running one candidate. There are 24 independent candidates. Outgoing Tory leader of Carlisle City Council John Mallinson has blamed Boris Johnson for the party's losses. Labour have taken control of the newly-created Cumberland authority, winning 30 of the 46 seats. Mr Mallinson told BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the Prime Minister 'bears a lot of the responsibility' for 'very poor' results and said he seemed to be attracting 'a lot of unrest and ill-feeling'. 'I have to say that issues like Partygate made it increasingly difficult to focus people's minds on local issues,' he said. And in a parting shot, Mr Mallinson added that Mr Johnson would be a 'poor option' to lead the Tories at the next general election, and if he did the party would 'pay for it'. To those of you joining MailOnline's live blog - good morning. It's been a big night for British politics, and the full extent of any shift in the political landscape will become clearer as more results come through today. Boris Johnson's Conservatives have suffered losses across England, and lost the totemic London authority of Wandsworth, which has been blue since 1978. Labour also snatched up Westminster, which had been Tory since its creation in the 1960s, and Barnet. But the picture for Sir Keir Starmer's party outside of London is more mixed, as they retained Sunderland but lost Hull to the Lib Dems. And speaking of the Lib Dems - party leader Sir Ed Davey hailed the Lib Dems' 'historic' wins in a warning shot to the Prime Minister. The Greens have also triumphantly claimed that their wins across England - which are so far more limited than the Lib Dems' - prove they are a credible 'alternative' to the establishment parties.  Local Tories are now demanding Mr Johnson's resignation as they blame their losses on Partygate and the economic crisis. In other developments: - Labour gained Southampton from the Conservatives. - The Tories lost Worcester to no overall control. - The Conservatives lost West Oxfordshire, which contains David Cameron's former Witney constituency, to no overall control. - Voters in Bristol decided to abolish the post of mayor in a referendum. - In Rutland, where there was not even an election, council leader Oliver Hemsley quit the Conservative group. - Votes will start to be counted later in more counties in England, Scotland and Wales. - In Northern Ireland, counting will begin to decide on the make-up of the Stormont Assembly, with Sinn Fein vying with the DUP to become the largest party. Voting guru John Curtice said the Conservatives have 'suffered a loss' at the local elections. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'The truth is the Conservatives have suffered more or less the kind of support that we might have anticipated given the evidence of the opinion polls, they are down by about four points in the sample of wards where we have been collecting the detailed voting figures overnight, and down by as much as six points as compared with last year. 'So don't let anybody run away with the idea that the Conservatives haven't suffered a loss. They have done.  'Indeed they have now lost 120 seats and indeed the news has just come through that not only have they lost Wandsworth and Barnet in London but they have now also lost Westminster which was perhaps a council theft would have hoped to hang onto. 'The other thing that I think perhaps some Conservative MPs will worry about is that the party also seems to have lost ground quite heavily in the south of England.  Its results have been rather better the further north we have gone. But of course lots of Tory MPs have their seats in the south of England.' Tories are downplaying Labour's wins, saying that the party has 'gone backwards' outside of London. But privately they are conceding that it has been a 'difficult night' for the Conservatives in the capital. A Tory source told Politico: 'Outside London, this is now looking like a bad night for Labour across the rest of the country.  'They have gone backwards in places like Sunderland, Tyneside, Hartlepool, Nuneaton, Sandwell and Amber Valley, showing they are seriously underperforming in former Labour heartlands which they need to regain.' Oliver Dowden played down losing Wandsworth Council to Labour this morning.  When asked about the loss, he told Sky News:  'We only won that by about 200 votes last time around, it was an unexpected hold, there is a general momentum across London which you have seen here and you saw actually in the last 20 years of elections in Wandsworth of us doing less well.' He added the Tories have faced 'challenging headlines for the past few months' but suggested this was because the party has been in power nationally for 12 years. Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden has put Conservative losses at the local elections down to mid-term challenges and said the Prime Minister is the right person to lead the party into the next general election. He told Sky News: 'I think looking at the picture of the results so far, they demonstrate that whilst there have been difficult results, they are consistent with what you'd expect with us from mid-term. 'Labour are certainly not on the path to power and I believe that Boris Johnson does have the leadership skills, in particular the energy and the dynamism that we need during this difficult period of time. 'So no, I don't think we should remove Boris Johnson as our prime minister, I think we should stick with him'. He also said: 'There have been challenging headlines for the past few months, but I do think that set against all of that, those sort of challenges that you would expect after 12 years in office, these are challenging results, but we have have made progress in lots of places.' Tory Party chairman Oliver Dowden has insisted that Labour's wins don't mean they can form the next government. Speaking to Kay Burley on Sky News, he stressed that the Conservatives have made gains outside the capital, in Hartlepool, Thurrock and Nuneaton.  'Actually, given that we're midterm, I think it doesn't show that Labour has the momentum to form the next government,' he said. 'But inevitably, midterm we are going to have challenges like this.' Asked about the reason for significant losses in Wandsworth and Westminster, Mr Dowden said the former had only been won by 200 votes previously. He described that previous result as an 'unexpected hold', adding: 'There is a general momentum across London which you've seen here. 'There have been challenging headlines for the past few months, but I think set against that, those sort of challenges that you would expect after 12 years in office.' Theresa May's former chief of staff Lord Barwell said the local election results were 'catastrophic' in London and should be a 'wake-up call'. He said on Twitter: 'Wandsworth & Westminster were flagship councils. 'We held them during the Blair honeymoon. 'We held them during austerity. 'We held them under Theresa May. 'Losing them should be a wake up call for the Conservative Party.' Sadiq Khan has called Boris Johnson a 'vote-winner for Labour' as he praised the party's win in Wandsworth.  The London Mayor said people there had voted to spite the Prime Minister. Labour have also taken control of Westminster and Barnet councils in the capital. So far the results have not been as apocalyptic as some had predicted. Voting guru John Curtice said that Labour does not look in a position to win a majority at the next general election.  He pointed out that the party's vote appears slightly down outside of London compared to the last time the seats were contested in 2018.  MailOnline's political editor James Tapsfield writes: Boris Johnson is facing demands to quit from furious Tories today as the party suffered a local election bloodbath in London. Read more here.  Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has hailed the party's 'historic' victories.  He told BBC Breakfast the Lib Dems are making 'big gains from the Conservatives in its heartlands' and from Labour in Hull. 'I said yesterday voters could use their ballots to send a message to Boris Johnson - that he failed to provide the leadership on the cost of living emergency... and I think they have sent that message,' he added. Sir Ed also said the results are 'very promising' for the next general election and it will reinvigorate his party's base. The Lib Dems have gained 57 council seats so far - the most of any party. Conservative leader of Carlisle City Council John Mallinson said the Prime Minister 'bears a lot of the responsibility' for the 'very poor' results after his party suffered a mass defeat in the local election. Mr Mallinson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I don't think any one person is responsible for everything, but he does seem to be attracting a lot of unrest and ill feeling at the moment'. Asked if that feeling will carry on until the next general election, the councillor said: 'I think if things remain the same it will, I think we'll pay for it'. He said Boris Johnson would be a 'poor option' to lead the Conservatives into the next general election. On the local elections campaign, he added: 'People seemed preoccupied with national issues, the cost-of-living crisis is weighing very heavily on people's minds, and I have to say that issues like partygate made it increasingly difficult to focus people's minds on local issues'. If you're just waking up: Good morning and welcome to MailOnline's live blog, where we've been covering the 2022 local elections.  It's been a big night for British politics, with Boris Johnson now facing calls to quit from furious Conservatives as the party takes a hammering at the polls. The Tories have lost major London authorities Wandsworth, Westminster and Barnet to Sir Keir Starmer's Labour - which itself suffered setbacks across England to the Lib Dems and Greens.  In other developments: - Labour lost Hull to the Liberal Democrats. - Labour gained Southampton from the Conservatives. - The Tories lost Worcester to no overall control. - The Conservatives lost West Oxfordshire, which contains David Cameron's former Witney constituency, to no overall control. - Voters in Bristol decided to abolish the post of mayor in a referendum. - In Rutland, where there was not even an election, council leader Oliver Hemsley quit the Conservative group. - Votes will start to be counted later in more counties in England, Scotland and Wales. - In Northern Ireland, counting will begin to decide on the make-up of the Stormont Assembly, with Sinn Fein vying with the DUP to become the largest party.   The new Labour leader of Westminster City Council has said his party's victory is a 'huge privilege'. Speaking at the Westminster City Council count, Adam Hug told the PA news agency: 'We are delighted that people in Westminster put their trust in us. It's a huge privilege. We are going to work really hard to put their interests first over the next four years. 'We have got a lot of big challenges ahead, we are going to get to work and we are going to help as many people as we can.' Greens co-leader Adrian Ramsay said local election results showed the party was now a 'credible alternative to the establishment parties'. He added: 'The Green Party has now made breakthrough gains three elections running and we are expecting that trajectory to continue as people increasingly vote for candidates who listen, work hard on local issues, and are serious about the climate emergency.' Labour has strengthened its grip on London, taking the totemic Tory authority in Wandsworth, winning Westminster for the first time since its creation in 1964 and clinching victory in Barnet. The loss of Wandsworth will be a significant blow because of its symbolic status in London. It turned blue in 1978, a year before Margaret Thatcher's election as prime minister and was reputedly her favourite council, noted for its low taxes. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said that 'history has been made' with the victory. Labour's success in Barnet, which has a large Jewish population, will be seen as a sign the party has turned the corner on the anti-Semitism rows which dogged Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. But do Keir Starmer's wins in London prove that Labour could beat the Tories at a general election? Punters this morning are saying that - unless you're a Labour MP - not necessarily. Ex-No10 polling wizard James Johnson told the BBC that the local elections don't reflect a Blair-style recovery for Labour. So far the big winners in England appear to be the Lib Dems and Greens - though it's early in the day yet.  A Labour MP has claimed that his party's wins in England could bode well for Scotland. Pat McFadden, Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: 'We're certainly looking for progress in Scotland.  'The position in England and the position in Scotland are related, because one of the things that's driven support for the SNP in recent years is the idea that Labour can't win in England. 'Getting back into a more competitive position in England, winning those symbolic councils like Wandsworth, Southampton, Cumberland, the other places that we made gains, these are important for Scottish voters too because when Scottish voters see that Labour can win in England, can be in a competitive position, then that gives us a boost in terms of our own vote in Scotland.'  But  the Labour MP for Wolverhampton South admitted that 'prediction is a dangerous game' in politics, with the majority of results yet to come in. Good morning, to anyone who is just waking up now and reading MailOnline's live blog. Boris Johnson is facing a backlash from local Tory leaders as his party lost major London authorities to Labour and suffered setbacks across England. Sir Keir Starmer's party further strengthened its grip on the capital, taking the totemic Tory authority in Wandsworth, making a significant breakthrough in Barnet and closing in on Westminster City Hall. Labour said it was on course for victory in Westminster and a senior Tory source admitted 'we will lose it'. In other developments: - Labour lost Hull to the Liberal Democrats. - Labour gained Southampton from the Conservatives. - The Tories lost Worcester to no overall control. - The Conservatives lost West Oxfordshire, which contains David Cameron's former Witney constituency, to no overall control. - Voters in Bristol decided to abolish the post of mayor in a referendum. - In Rutland, where there was not even an election, council leader Oliver Hemsley quit the Conservative group. - Votes will start to be counted later in more counties in England, Scotland and Wales. - In Northern Ireland, counting will begin to decide on the make-up of the Stormont Assembly, with Sinn Fein vying with the DUP to become the largest party. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: 'This is a great night for the Liberal Democrats. We're making progress all over the country - building on our historic by-election victories last year. 'We have already taken seats off the Conservatives in Blue Wall areas like Cheadle, and taken control of Hull Council from Labour. 'From Colchester to Hull, from Wimbledon to Gosport, more and more communities are choosing Liberal Democrats to be their local champions and fight for a fair deal for them. 'People across the UK are fed up with being ignored and taken for granted by Boris Johnson and the Conservatives. 'It's clear that, in many parts of the country, it is the Liberal Democrats who can defeat the Conservatives and get Boris Johnson out of Downing Street.' Labour sources appeared confident of winning Westminster for the first time. A source said the party expected to take control of the council which has been held by the Tories since 1964. Conservative MP for Wimbledon Stephen Hammond has claimed that Partygate was a big influence on voting. He says his local area saw a high turnout as 'angry Tories' voted against his party. 'That ought to be a clarion bell ringing in Downing Street to make sure we are concentrating on the cost of living,' he said. 'Any government that doesn't have people like Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt clearly isn't using all the talents available to it.' Asked about Boris Johnson's future, he told the BBC: 'I think he has to prove his integrity to the country.' After Bristol voted to scrap its elected mayor and run the council with a committee system, Green group leader Heather Mack said: 'The outcome of tonight's vote marks a new chapter in the way our city is run.  'For many years now, important decisions affecting the whole of our city have been made behind closed doors by just one person whom the public and elected councillors cannot easily challenge.' Councillor Jos Clark, leader of the Liberal Democrat group, said: 'The Bristol Liberal Democrat group brought the motion for this referendum to full council in December last year and in the spirit of cross-party working were happy to let the Green Party second the motion. 'This is a good example of working together for the good of our city and we look forward to more collaboration in future and under a fairer system.' Councillor Mark Weston, leader of the Conservative group, said: 'The mayoral model has proven a disaster for Bristol - too much power at the whim of one individual. The public have rejected this unaccountable model of government.  'We now need all parties to work together to bring in a more conciliatory form of politics to Bristol.' Shabana Mahmood MP, Labour's national campaign co-ordinator, said the results were a 'turning point' for Sir Keir Starmer's party. 'After the disastrous results of 2019, these early results are showing the progress we have made thanks to Keir's leadership,' she said. 'Labour is making headway in England, Scotland and Wales, taking over key Conservative councils and winning in vital Parliamentary battlegrounds across the country. 'Voters have put their trust in the change Keir Starmer's Labour represents.' A Labour victory in the London borough of Barnet 'does not bode well' for the Conservatives for a general election, a local Tory leader has said. Barnet Conservative leader Daniel Thomas said: 'I think this is a warning shot from Conservative supporters and I think our loss today is not only due to the fact that I have just mentioned but also a fair number of Conservative voters who just didn't go out to vote, stayed at home.' He added: 'Clearly if Labour are to get a majority in Parliament they need to win Barnet. They won the council, if they win our parliamentary constituencies as well, then it doesn't bode well for us to form a Government in future general elections.' Voters in Bristol voted to scrap their elected mayor in a referendum on the way the city is run. In a vote on Thursday, 56,113 opted for a committee system, with 38,439 preferring to continue with an elected mayor, on a turnout of 28.6%. The referendum result is likely to be ratified at an extraordinary meeting of the full council on May 24, and Labour's Marvin Rees will continue as Bristol's mayor until May 2024, when the new system will start. Tory former Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said the results do not suggest that 'people are flocking to Keir Starmer's banner' or that Labour is on course to win the next general election. He also said he's 'very sorry' for the Conservative councillors who have lost seats and particularly about the loss of Wandsworth. Mr Jenrick said there have been good results for Labour in London, but said he does not see evidence of Labour progress elsewhere. If you're just joining us - good morning and welcome to MailOnline's live blog. Boris Johnson's Conservatives have suffered electoral losses across England, including Thatcher's beloved London flagship authority of Wandsworth. Sadiq Khan hailed Wandsworth's flip to Labour as local Tories insisted that the Prime Minister's partygate scandal and performance in office were 'an issue'. But outside London, the picture was mixed for Sir Keir Starmer's party. After results were declared from 53 councils, the Tories had lost control of two authorities and were down 55 councillors, Labour had a net gain of one council and 21 councillors, the Lib Dems had one authority and 31 more seats while the Greens had put on 19 councillors. The Tories also lost control of Worcester to no overall control, with gains for the Greens and Labour.Council seats are up for grabs in Scotland, Wales and many parts of England, while there are elections to Stormont in Northern Ireland. But votes were only being counted in some of the English contests overnight, including key authorities in the capital. The outgoing Conservative leader of Wandsworth Council Ravi Govindia has claimed that Boris Johnson was 'an issue'. He told the BBC 'inevitably other events have clouded the judgement of people in Wandsworth'. 'We have done exactly what the residents of Wandsworth wanted - to find that counts for nothing is a sad reflection of importance of local government not being recognised,' Mr Govindia added. Labour gained control of Southampton from the Conservatives, who previously held 25 of the 48 seats.  Labour won 13 of the seats being contested, to finish the night with 26, with Conservatives on 21, and Liberal Democrats on one. 'We can't now numerically save it', he told the BBC. Mr Smith blamed mid-term blues, but also called on the Prime Minister and the Chancellor to do more to help people deal with the cost of living crisis. The Conservatives are increasingly pessimistic about the situation in Westminster, a council they have run since its creation in 1964. 'We will lose it,' a senior Tory source said. The new Labour leader of Wandsworth council said his party's victory signalled it was 'time for change' at the top of the Government. Wandsworth's new Labour leader Simon Hogg said: 'We are going to build a compassionate council that truly listens and keep that same low council tax. 'But when we were calling around on voters we didn't even have to raise partygate, we didn't have to mention Boris Johnson. People have formed their own views on this Government, so I am afraid it is time for change at the top as well.' London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted a photograph of himself standing beside Labour councillor Simon Hogg. Alongside the photograph, Mr Khan wrote: 'The three words we've wanted to hear for so long: WANDSWORTH LABOUR GAIN 'The first Labour council leader of Wandsworth in 44 years.. 'Congratulations @CllrSimonHogg' Salford's Labour mayor Paul Dennett said he was a 'little bit disappointed' after the party lost three seats in the city council elections. He said: 'What we need to do is learn from residents and communities about what issues and concerns they have. 'We take every single election really seriously in Salford and we're not wholly reliant on what the national party is or isn't doing, but it would be useful to have real clarity on what national policy is to enable us to bolster what we are trying to do locally. 'There is a lot going on, we have years and years of austerity and we're facing a cost-of-living crisis. 'When we're doorknocking we see people are really frustrated at the moment with the political system.' Labour remains in overall control of the council, which had a third of its seats up for election this year. Labour is confident of winning Wandsworth from the Tories. A Labour source said: 'Boris Johnson losing Wandsworth is monumental. This was the Tories' jewel in the crown. 'Voters in Wandsworth have put their trust in the change Keir Starmer's Labour represents.' Hardline republicans Sinn Fein - who want a united Ireland - are favorites to become the largest party in the power-sharing executive for the first time in its history, overtaking the Democratic Unionist Party.

    "dae2c956770f66154f33de58f79ec045e1b54e695082ebb47765e54a": "Boris Johnson is facing demands to quit from furious Tories today as the party suffered a local election bloodbath in London - but Keir Starmer failed to make big strides towards power.  After a campaign dominated by sleaze and Partygate, the Tories were defeated by Labour in the totemic strongholds of Wandsworth and Westminster - which they have held since 1978 and 1964 respectively.  The Conservatives also lost Barnet and Southampton to Labour and West Oxfordshire and Worcester to no overall control. Conservative Holds: Broxbourne, Thurrock, Nuneaton & Bedworth, Epping Forest, Basildon, Rochford, Brentwood, Harlow, Rushmoor, Redditch, Fareham, Amber Valley, North East Lincolnshire, Tamworth, Dudley, Bexley, Hillingdon Losses: Worcester (to no overall control), Wandsworth (to Labour), Westminster (to Labour), Southampton (to Labour), West Oxfordshire (to NOC), Barnet (to Labour) Labour Gains: Cumberland (from NOC), Wandsworth (from Tories), Southampton (from Tories), Barnet (from Tories) Holds: Sunderland, Halton, South Tyneside, Chorley, Tameside, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sefton, Stevenage, Lincoln, Sandwell, Exeter, Ipswich, Wigan, Coventry, Salford, North Tyneside, Preston, Oldham, Waltham Forest, Wolverhampton, Barnsley, Ealing, Barking & Dagenham, Redbridge Loss: Kingston-upon-Hull (to Lib Dems) Lib Dems Gain: Kingston-upon-Hull (from Labour) Hold: Eastleigh   What other results are expected and when? Around 9am: Counting begins for a further 71 councils in England and all councils in Scotland and Wales.  As counting continues, livid local leaders are already turning on the PM, ordering Mr Johnson to 'look in the mirror' and consider whether he should stay.  But so far the results have not been as apocalyptic as some had predicted, with voting guru John Curtice saying Labour still does not look in a position to win a majority at the next general election.  He pointed out that the party's vote appears slightly down outside of London compared to the last time the seats were contested in 2018 - and crucially it did not make huge inroads into the so-called Red Wall. Sir Keir visited Barnet this morning and claimed his party was 'back on track', but No10 insiders jibed that he could not even 'dream' of being premier based on this showing.  Instead the biggest winners have been the Lib Dems and the Greens, who have been taking seats off both main parties.  The Tories are in line to lose between 200 and 300 councillors - a grim toll but far lower than the 800 some had feared.  Some senior Conservatives warned that Mr Johnson had been the fundamental problem on the doorstep, and ministers are anxious. 'There is serious unease. They know that Boris was the issue,' one veteran campaigner told MailOnline. 'It wasn't policies, despite the cost-of-living crisis.' However, MPs have been relatively muted in their public criticism of Mr Johnson, with former minister Stephen Hammond saying he must 'prove his integrity to the country again'.  And Cabinet ministers rallied round this morning, with Tory chairman Oliver Dowden blaming a mid-term backlash from voters and insisting the PM is the right person to lead into the next general election.  A senior No10 source delivered a stark message to would-be leadership rivals, telling MailOnline it is 'hard to imagine any other Conservative leader doing better than this'.  The PM was said to be pessimistic about his party's chances of avoiding a drubbing before the counts began, with the BBC reporting he yesterday told aides: 'We are going to get our a*** kicked tonight.'  Conservative leader of Carlisle City Council John Mallinson urged Tory MPs to decide whether they wanted Mr Johnson to lead them into the next general election. He told Sky News the PM 'must shoulder an awful lot of the blame' for a poor local elections performance and described how Partygate and the cost-of-living crisis were key concerns of voters. Mr Mallinson said there was a feeling among the public that 'the Government are not in touch and, sadly I have to say, the PM cannot be relied upon to be telling the truth'. He said Mr Johnson said Mr Johnson would be a 'poor option' to lead the Tories into the next election and he expected Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the powerful 1922 Committee, to receive more letters of no confidence in Mr Johnson from MPs. The councillor added: 'Whether it gets to 54 or not (the number of letters needed to trigger a confidence vote in the PM), I'm not sure. But I rather feel that's they way it's going.' Simon Bosher, the Conservative group leader on Portsmouth City Council, said: 'Those in power in Westminster really do need to take a good hard look in the mirror. 'Because it's the rank-and-file grassroots members who they rely on who are actually losing their seats tonight.' He also called on the PM to reflect on the Tories' local election performance as he hit out at 'too many mistakes, too many mismanged situations' from the party's leadership. Barnet Conservative leader Daniel Thomas said Labour's victory in the London borough 'does not bode well' for the Tories ahead of the next general election.  'I think this is a warning shot from Conservative supporters and I think our loss today is not only due to the fact that I have just mentioned but also a fair number of Conservative voters who just didn't go out to vote, stayed at home,' he said.  'Clearly if Labour are to get a majority in Parliament they need to win Barnet. They won the council, if they win our parliamentary constituencies as well.' Marc Bayliss, the Tory leader of Worcester City Council, told reporters he was heading home early from the election count and is anticipating a disastrous night for his party.   Mr Bayliss blamed Partygate and said the public had found the Government's performance 'wanting'.  His comments were echoed by the leader of the Conservatives on Sunderland Council, Antony Mullen, who called for Boris Johnson to step down. He told the BBC: 'It's been Partygate - it's suppressed our turnout. Quite clearly that's the only thing that has changed nationally that has affected this. 'The best chance of reviving the Conservative Party's fortunes will be with a new leader. If there is no improvement in the party's reputation, then clearly something has to change.' The leader of the Labour group of Barnet council, which looks set to be a gain, admitted the results were more about disillusionment with the Tories than enthusiasm for his party. Barry Rawlings told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I'll be honest, it's not us being wonderful. 'I think a lot of Conservatives haven't voted this time, I think they feel alienated from No 10 and that they are, I don't know, they've been disappointed with Boris Johnson and so not voting and I think that's made a difference as well.' Despite the chaos, Labour also saw several surprising setbacks across the country. Sir Keir's party lost Kingston upon Hull City Council to the resurgent Liberal Democrats, who appeared to be the early winners and were making gains across the country.  The Lib Dems are also '99 per cent sure' that the Tories will lose control of West Oxfordshire - which includes ex-prime minister David Cameron's former seat Witney.  It was a similar story for the Green Party who chipped away at Conservative and Labour seats in England. Number 10 had feared for weeks that a dismal set of local election results would spark a Tory coup attempt in the wake of the Partygate scandal.  The Lib Dems and Greens are emerging as the biggest winners from the local elections today after voters shunned the main parties.  Both the Tories and Labour suffered disappointing results, with Boris Johnson enduring a bloodbath in London while Keir Starmer's progress across England was underwhelming. But the Lib Dems have added more than 50 councillors to their tally and seized control of Kingston-Upon-Hull authority from Labour. They made inroads against the Conservatives in West Oxfordshire and Stockport.  For their part, the Greens have racked up an extra 20-plus seats.  Election guru John Curtice said the Lib Dems were 'the surprise of tonight'. 'In terms of share of the vote, the progress is relatively modest, but they might just be hoping they are finally demonstrating some recovery from the 2015 general election,' he told the BBC. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said: 'There is now a real picture emerging across the country, particularly in areas held by the Conservatives, that the Lib Dems are the real challengers.'  Wimbledon MP Mr Hammond told the BBC that the results were 'a clarion bell ringing in Downing Street to make sure we are concentrating on the cost of living'  and Mr Johnson needed to restore his reputation after Partygate. 'I think he has to prove that his government is concentrating on what people really want,' he said.  'I think he has to prove his integrity to the country again.'  Mr Hammond also urged the PM to bring 'talents back into the government'. 'Any government that doesn't have people like Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt clearly isn't using all the talents available to it,' he added. Conservative MP David Simmonds said Mr Johnson had some 'difficult questions' to answer. The MP for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner said voters were unhappy about the disclosures over lockdown parties in Downing Street and Whitehall. 'It was a pretty clear message on the doorstep. Clearly the Prime Minister has got some difficult questions to answer,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 'Overwhelmingly the message that I heard on the doorsteps was people were broadly positive about the Government's policies but they are not happy about what they have been hearing about partygate. 'He said, 'I will take full responsibility for these election results', and I think he needs to confront that question now.' Prof Curtice said the Tories looked on track to lose between 200 and 300 seats, but Labour were underperforming outside London. 'Labour are probably somewhat disappointed,' he told the BBC.  He added it is not a performance 'that indicated a party that is on course for winning a general election with a majority'. Prof Curtice said it did not even suggest Labour would necessarily be the largest party in the next Parliament.  'Outside of London, as compared to 2018 when these seats were last contested, it looks like their seats are down slightly,' Prof Curtice said.  'And for a party that is trying to regain ground in the so-called Red Wall seats in the Midlands and north of England, this wasn't quite the progress they wanted. 'There is still a very substantial legacy of the impact of Brexit on both the character of the Conservative and Labour supporters. The Conservatives are still much stronger in Leave areas, and therefore Labour is still struggling to make more progress there.' Sir Keir travelled to Barnet to celebrate with supporters this morning and tried to put a brave face on the moderate results. 'This is a big turning point for us. From the depths of 2019 in that general election, back on track, winning in the north. Cumberland! Southampton! We've changed Labour and now we're seeing the results of that,' he said. He added: 'What brilliant teams we've got, all the fantastic work we've put in. 'When it comes to London, you can hardly believe those names come off our lips. Wandsworth! They've been saying for years 'You'll never take Wandsworth from us.' We've just done it! Westminster! It's an astonishing result.' Mr Dowden told Sky News: 'I think looking at the picture of the results so far, they demonstrate that whilst there have been difficult results, they are consistent with what you'd expect with us from mid-term. 'Labour are certainly not on the path to power and I believe that Boris Johnson does have the leadership skills, in particular the energy and the dynamism that we need during this difficult period of time. 'So no, I don't think we should remove Boris Johnson as our prime minister, I think we should stick with him.' He also said: 'There have been challenging headlines for the past few months, but I do think that set against all of that, those sort of challenges that you would expect after 12 years in office, these are challenging results, but we have have made progress in lots of places.' Mr Dowden said there was a 'mixed picture' and there had been gains in places like Hartlepool, Nuneaton and Thurrock. 'This isn't like what Tony Blair got in say '95 two years before his election victory, they were making 1,800 gains. If you look at Ed Miliband (he) managed to make 800 gains in 2011 and still not win the election,' he added. Tory sources played down the Labour showing, saying it was a 'bad night' for Sir Keir outside the capital. 'They have gone backwards in places like Sunderland, Tyneside, Hartlepool, Nuneaton, Sandwell and Amber Valley, showing they are seriously underperforming in former Labour heartlands which they need to regain,' one senior source said.  A No10 insider said they were 'very sorry and sad for good Conservatives who lost their seats' and it was 'tragic to think the good people of Westminster and Wandsworth are now destined to pay higher taxes'. 'But overall, across the UK the Conservatives have so far done better than expected,' the source insisted. 'Keir Starmer is clearly not making the progress he needs to even dream of being in government and it's hard to imagine any other Conservative leader doing better than this.' Allies of the PM are preparing a counter-offensive in case rebel Tories seek to use bruising results as an excuse to pounce.  They will try to soothe nerves among backbenchers by arguing the PM has got the 'big calls right' and is the best person to navigate the economy through 'choppy water ahead'. A Cabinet source said: 'Boris delivered Brexit, got us through Covid, and is now right at the front of the global response to the invasion of Ukraine. 'He is absolutely the right leader to take Britain forward.' Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis was the first Cabinet minister out in support of the PM last night, as he dismissed suggestions that a poor election result could pile pressure on Mr Johnson. 'I absolutely think we can win the next general election and I do think Boris Johnson is the right person to lead us into that,' he told Sky News. 'He's got those big decisions - through Covid and internationally with Ukraine and other areas - right since he's been PM and he has my full support to continue to do that.' But Mr Lewis also admitted it was set to be a 'difficult set of elections' for the Tories. 'We came into these elections with Labour having a consistent lead in the polls,' he added.  'It's the elections where the particular seats and councils up for election are the ones that tend to favour Labour.'  Millions of voters cast their ballots on Thursday as council seats in large swathes of the country were up for grabs. In England more than 4,000 council seats were contested across 146 councils including in Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and all 32 London boroughs. All 32 councils in Scotland and all 22 in Wales also held elections. Polls had suggested the Conservatives could do badly in the so-called Blue Wall, their traditional heartlands in southern England.  But most telling will be whether the party manages to prevent Labour making a significant comeback in the Red Wall areas, which switched from red to blue for the first time at the 2019 general election. Early results were not overwhelmingly convincing for Labour, with the party losing control of Kingston upon Hull city council to the Liberal Democrats. The Tory loss of Wandsworth was a seismic result, as the London borough was famously Margaret Thatcher's favourite and had been a flagship Conservative council for more than 40 years. As he celebrated at the Wandsworth count, London Mayor Sadiq Khan told Sky News: 'This council first went Tory in 1978 when Margaret Thatcher was leader of the opposition. 'Margaret Thatcher, John Major, William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Howard, David Cameron, Theresa May - at all those times this was a Conservative council. 'But the combination of Boris Johnson as the Conservative Prime Minister and Keir Starmer as our leader has brought this seat home to Labour.' A Labour source said: 'Boris Johnson losing Wandsworth is monumental. This was the Tories' jewel in the crown.  'Voters in Wandsworth have put their trust in the change Keir Starmer's Labour represents.'  Shadow health minister Rosena Allin-Khan, the Tooting MP, claimed that 'people are absolutely fed up of 44 years of Tory governance in Wandsworth, and they are fed up Boris Johnson's lies and deceit and it is time for change'. Her fellow shadow minister, Tulip Siddiq, had earlier highlighted Labour's holding of Sunderland City Council as an early success for her party as council election results started to come. She claimed the Tories had 'thrown the kitchen sink at it' and highlighted how the PM had visited the area on Monday. Sir Keir had sought to make the local elections campaign about the Partygate row after Mr Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined by police. But this appeared to backfire in recent days as he struggled to answer questions about a lockdown gathering in Durham last year when he was pictured swigging beer. The PM yesterday appeared to be in good spirits as he arrived to cast his vote in Westminster accompanied by his dog Dilyn. Sir Keir voted in Kentish Town, north London, while Sir Ed Davey voted in Surbiton, south-west London. The Liberal Democrats leader said the Conservatives would be punished in the local elections for their handling of the cost of living crisis. Sir Ed expressed confidence his party would 'gain ground in areas across the Blue Wall where voters are fed up of being taken for granted by the Conservatives'. Mr Johnson will attempt to get back on the front foot next Tuesday as his Government's legislative agenda is set out in the Queen's Speech.  The PM is expected to delay a reshuffle of his Cabinet until the summer as it is believed he wants to be clear of the Partygate scandal before resetting his team. But yesterday there was speculation he could call a snap general election before the end of this year over fears the economic picture could get much worse. The prospect of Mr Johnson being forced out of Number 10 over the local election results was gleefully seized upon by Dominic Cummings, the PM's estranged former chief aide, yesterday. The ex-No10 adviser made a sensational polling day plea for voters to force 'regime change' as he launched a blistering attack on the 'intellectually, politically, and organisationally rancid' Tories. Referring to Mr Johnson as 'the trolley' and a 'clown' in a Twitter tirade, Mr Cummings claimed it was 'irrational' for Tories to 'prop up' the PM any more. Although the first results in England began to arrive last night, counting in council elections in Wales and Scotland was not due to begin until 9am today. The Scottish Tories are braced for 'heavy losses' and expected to suffer their worst election result in Scotland in at least a decade. There are concerns Conservative supporters in Scotland failed to turn out due to anger at the PM and Downing Street parties. A senior Scottish Tory source said: 'The phones have been bad, very bad. 'It looks like we are going to suffer fairly heavy losses and we fully expect to finish third. 'Tory voters are not going to Labour, but a lot of them are staying at home because of Boris and Partygate. 'We expect it to be a poor election for us, our worst election in a decade or more.' However, despite the expectation of a gloomy result, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross was ready to insist he will not stand down. A source close to Mr Ross said: 'Douglas is going nowhere, he is definitely not resigning. Voters have sent a message to Boris, not Douglas. 'He is fully focused on the long term job here: the next Westminster and Scottish Parliament elections.'",

Emergency services were called to the incident on Blackburn Road, Egerton at 7.30am yesterday, in which no-one was hurt, but left locals staring at what one described as 'a war zone'. Footage shows the lorry careering down the road and smashing into white van, before hitting a black car and another car crushing them against three separate walls, which are torn down in the process. Anthony Ashton, 34, a locksmith and the owner of the white van and car which were hit said he is still in shock from the incident. He said: 'It didn't feel like I woke up, yesterday, everything was in a haze, I lost track of time, it was just a very odd day.' 'I heard an almighty bang outside, I looked out the window and noticed the car and van had gone,' he said.  Mr Ashton was in bed when the truck came storming down the street, first hitting a parked Ford Fiesta before crushing his van and then his wife's Nissan Qashqai.   He said he was 'completely shocked' at the damage it caused, adding: 'I was gutted.' 'I went outside and saw absolute carnage. There were walls demolished, our cars had gone, and one of the neighbours' cars had gone as well. 'Then I turned around and said, 'Oh there's my van! Why is it over there? Why is it five feet in the air? And why is it that funny shape?' Ashton said didn't know what made the HGV driver crash in the leafy residential village, but had taken down the his registration.  'The HGV hit a Fiesta which was parked behind my van, it then hit my van, hit the Qashqai and demolished four garden walls and then into the church walls. 'My wife's car is in pieces still outside the house at the moment but my van was picked up by recovery and the insurance then picked it up,' he continued.   Mr Ashton said: 'I have my own locksmith business and now I've lost quite a lot of my tools which were in the van, there were 15 years of tools in there and my tool machine is in two pieces which is my biggest earner.' Anthony claims the truck may have done up to PS5,000 worth of damage, with many of the tools that were in his van left mangled and unusable. He said: 'I'm pretty sure 90 per cent are lost or broken, he said. 'My key cutting machine for one, that's PS1,500. I've got some of them back, but I'm not sure what is working.' Sharing on Facebook, Ashton wrote: 'Just a quick message to all my customers, I'm out of action for a couple of days. My van (and the Mrs car) have been written off this morning. A wagon has hit them whist parked outside the house and absolutely devastated them. 'No one injured at all, everyone is fine. Just no work being done for a couple of days.' The owner of AA Locksmith NW said: 'I already have a courtesy van so I can continue my work which I'm really glad about, it's been a life saver and the emergency services on site allowed to get some of my tools. 'The help from the police and fire on the scene was really good and every single neighbour has offered help, it been quite heartwarming,' Mr Ashton said.  Blackburn Road, Egerton, between Cross Guns and Thomas Egerton pub was closed throughout the morning of the incident. The Greater Manchester Police said: 'We were called shortly after 7.30am to a report of a multi-vehicle collision on Blackburn Road, Egerton. 'No injuries have been reported and enquiries into the cause of the collision are ongoing.'",
    "fa6088c3728ffc9f478f3cf33084717af4cac61f72e4207605fd0b89": "Britain could enjoy its hottest day of the year so far today with some areas forecast to be hotter than Majorca. Temperatures are expected to soar into the mid-20Cs (mid-70Fs) this afternoon - and forecasters said that if peak highs aren't seen today, it is 'likely' that this year's record will be broken at some point in the coming days. A high of 23.4C (74F) was recorded at St James's Park in London on Good Friday, April 15, which is the hottest of 2022 so far - and if that is beaten anywhere in the UK today, then it will probably be in South East England. It will also make the UK hotter than many European holiday destinations today, with highs including 19C (66F) in Nice, 20C (68F) in Barcelona and Ibiza, 21C (70F) in Malta, 22C (72F) in Corfu and 23C (73F) in Majorca.  Meteorologists have also issued a warning to Britons who might be looking forward to making the most of the hot weather over the coming week, advising them to wear sun cream and not be in the sun for long periods. Met Office meteorologist Annie Shuttleworth said: 'It's possible we could see the warmest day in parts of the South East. If we don't see it on Friday, we'll likely see it at least on one day next week.' She said temperatures this month are expected to be 'much warmer than average', adding: 'Average temperatures at this point in early May is about 17C (63F) for London and somewhere around 15C (59F) outside of that. 'It's quite likely we'll see those warm and much warmer than average temperatures across the UK.' The high temperatures are forecast to stay consistent for at least the next week. Ms Shuttleworth added: 'UV levels will likely be high. Some protection is advised, and long periods in the sunshine not recommended.' The mercury is expected to peak at 25C (77F) or 26C (79F) in the South in the latter half of next week - and the warm weather should continue into the following weekend, with the North experiencing highs in the low-20Cs. MeteoGroup forecaster Donal Considine said a surge of warm air would be drawn up from the south as a result of high pressure hovering over central Europe. 'We'll get a day-on-day increase in temperatures as warm air is pulled up from North Africa and Spain because of the direction of the winds,' he added. 'So next week there is the potential for maximum temperatures 4C to 5C above average.' London and the South East can expect at least 24C (75F) from Wednesday onwards and it could keep getting hotter, with 26C (79F) possible. Met Office meteorologist Marco Petagna predicted it could even get 'very warm' towards the end of this month. The Met Office's three-month summer outlook predicts an 'increase in the likelihood of warmer-than-average conditions in the month ahead'. It adds: 'Predictions are consistent in suggesting an increase in the likelihood of temperatures being above average overall. 'While this doesn't necessarily mean heatwaves will occur, it does increase the likelihood of heatwaves compared to normal.' The Met Office defines a heatwave as an extended period - at least three consecutive days - of much hotter than normal weather.",
    "3f4f15452d97582fb9418fa00efe561805968443e20b10567a468864": "The Queen still plans to attend the State Opening of Parliament next Tuesday, Buckingham Palace has revealed - but measures are in place to minimise the distance she would have to walk amid her ongoing mobility issues. Her Majesty will need to walk from a car to the building then through the Robing Room to the Lords Chamber, and she will then have to take three steps up to her throne, from which she delivers her Speech. If the Queen was unable to attend, the likely candidate to read the Speech would be the monarch's son Prince Charles. Buckingham Palace has said the Queen 'plans to attend' the event but that this would be confirmed on the day. It would be the most high-profile constitutional event she has been able to go to for two years. The 96-year-old monarch will travel by car from Buckingham Palace to Westminster on Tuesday under the current plans. She has not used a carriage since 2019 as she finds her state limousine more comfortable. There will also be a slimmed down - but still spectacular - military ceremony with fewer troops but the same standards of pomp and military splendour involving eight different units, including The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery and The Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.  As the Queen's car leaves the palace a royal salute will take place and the National Anthem will be played. She no longer wears her Imperial Crown or Robes of State given their weight and awkwardness and instead wears smart day dress. In 2016 the Queen used a lift rather than the stairs for the State Opening of Parliament for the first time in 64 years. The State Opening of Parliament is one of the monarch's most significant public duties, and involves the reading of the Queen's Speech outlining the government's policies and proposed legislation for the new parliamentary session. The Queen has opened Parliament all but two times during her reign. The exceptions were in 1959, the year she was pregnant with the Duke of York, and 1963, when she was pregnant with the Earl of Wessex. The ceremony was not held in 2020 and last year a reduced capacity Covid-secure state opening of Parliament was staged on May 11 with the Queen present. There has been speculation about whether the Queen will fulfil one of her major duties as head of state, especially after it was announced she would not be attending the garden party season and instead would be represented by members of her family. The head of state has missed a number of major events this year but has been carrying out virtual engagements and her other duties. Garden parties will be staged from next week for the first time in three years and are important events in the royal calendar as those who have served their country or communities are invited to the monarch's home. Buckingham Palace said: 'Her Majesty The Queen will be represented by other members of the royal family at this year's garden parties, with details on attendance to be confirmed in due course.' The Queen attended a service commemorating the life of the Duke of Edinburgh in March with senior royals and a congregation of hundreds. She reached her Platinum Jubilee in February, overcame a bout of Covid after testing positive that month, and celebrated her 96th birthday privately on April 21 at her Sandringham estate. Last October, the Queen spent a night in hospital and spent the following three months under doctors' orders to only conduct light duties and missed a number of prominent events. The Queen has been using a walking stick in public since she attended a service marking the centenary of the Royal British Legion last October. It is understood the key factor in other members of the royal family being asked to represent the Queen was the length of time royal hosts spend standing during garden parties which last well over an hour. The events will be staged at Buckingham Palace on May 11, 18 and 25, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh will be the venue for a party on June 29. The Queen has given permission for the annual garden party for forces charity The Not Forgotten Association, which supports disabled veterans and serving wounded, to take place at her official London home on May 12, hosted by the organisation's patron the Princess Royal.",
    "6f81a49ea80cd1c7a8c582595d0b3384753b8d67e1e41071ffc41d42": "A police officer is under criminal investigation today after the death of a 27-year-old son of a distinguished economist who was hit by an unmarked Sussex Police BMW. Arthur Holscher-Ermert had been on foot when the incident happened shortly after 11.10pm on Saturday night and was confirmed dead at the scene on the A259 South Coast Road in Peacehaven, East Sussex. Britain's police watchdog has said it has advised the driver of the unmarked police car which hit Mr Holscher-Ermert that he is under criminal investigation for the offence of causing death by dangerous driving. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the unnamed officer, who is a police constable, will also be investigated for potential gross misconduct.  The IOPC said it will decide at the end of its investigation whether to refer a file to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether the officer should be prosecuted. This could take up to six months.  It is not yet clear if the policeman has been arrested. A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'The officer has not undertaken duties since the incident and will be placed on restricted duties that are not public-facing pending the outcome of the investigation'. Video emerged this week that appeared to show the moment a police car mowed Arthur down.  Officers had been pursuit of the amateur footballer when he abandoned his car and fled on foot. A Dashcam showed the moment the police BMW hit Mr Holscher-Ermert as he tried to run across a road.  Witnesses claimed they saw officers put handcuffs on Mr Holscher-Ermert as he lay face down in the road in a pool of his own blood, crying out for help. One witness was heard yelling: 'You've killed the man, you've killed the man'. Professor Jens Holscher, Mr Holscher-Ermert's father, said: 'I'm still in a state of shock. They should have explained the circumstances, and I'm still not quite clear on what happened. Apparently there was a chase, and we still don't know whether it was an accident.'  The IOPC said it had so far gathered evidence indicating that Mr Holscher-Ermert had been driving an Audi which was being pursued by a police car after it came to the attention of officers in the Newhaven and Peacehaven area. They said the pursuit ended in Bramber Avenue, where Mr Holscher-Ermert left the Audi and was struck moments later by a different police vehicle. A family friend has set up a GoFundMe fundraiser to cover the costs of Arthur's funeral. In a post, Holly Horgan said: 'Arthur was a very loved brother, son and friend who tragically lost his life at the hands of Sussex police. This fundraiser is to help with funds for Arthur's funeral. All donations will be handed to Karl.' Writing on Facebook, Karl said: 'A close friend of mine and Arthur's has set this up for us, I know a lot of people wanted to contribute towards funeral costs and legal fees etc so here is a go fund me page set up for any donations people wanted to make'. IOPC regional director Graham Beesley said they will examine events leading up to the collision and police actions in the immediate aftermath, including reports that handcuffs were used on Mr Holscher-Ermert at the scene. He said: 'It is important we establish why Mr Holscher-Ermert was being pursued by the police including what, if any, information the police had about him or the vehicle he was driving. 'We will also consider whether the actions of officers afterwards were in line with policy and procedure. This will include looking at the aftercare given to him. 'We are aware of reports handcuffs were applied to Mr Holscher-Ermert at the scene and this will form part of our investigation.' He said Mr Holscher-Ermert's family has been updated and will be meeting with the IOPC soon. He added: 'We understand the concern this incident has caused in the community and I would like to reassure everyone that we will carry out a thorough and independent investigation to establish exactly what happened and why.' The watchdog has reviewed dashcam footage from a member of the public who was driving in the area when the incident happened and are also analysing footage from the police car involved in the collision as well as body-worn video from officers who arrived at the scene. Investigators have also been in the area to locate any other CCTV footage that might be available, and to carry out house-to-house inquiries to identify any witnesses. Mr Holscher-Ermert's family have threatened to sue Sussex Police and have demanded a senior police officer apologise for the death.  Video footage of the immediate aftermath of the incident appeared to show police kneeling on Mr Holscher-Ermert's back as he lies face down in the road - as a panicked onlooker shouts at the officers: 'You've killed the man, you've killed the man'. A second clip shows Mr Holscher-Ermert on his back while an officer attempts CPR on the dying man.  One friend said he believed the police had been pursuing Mr Holscher-Ermert because he had been driving without insurance. However, video shows he was struck on foot.   Mr Holscher-Ermert's older brother Karl has claimed that the 27-year-old was going to a nearby fast food restaurant when he was hit by the car. Other friends claimed he had stepped out to get a burger at Big Mouths Burger Bar on South Coast Road when the incident took place. Prof Holscher previously told MailOnline he had not received an apology from Sussex Police and said that the IOPC told him the officer who drove the unmarked car has not been suspended from duty. The head of department for economics at Bournemouth University was on holiday in France with partner when he received a phone call early on Sunday from a police officer explaining his son had died in an 'accident'. The German-born lecturer, 60, said: 'It is so difficult to comprehend - I cannot believe it. I cannot understand what is happening at the moment. We are so disturbed - that is my little son and nothing is being done. We believe there is a serious fault on the police side and we will take legal action immediately.  'We haven't even had an apology - how low can you get? We want him [the officer responsible] taken off the street.' Prof Holscher's partner Sonia Drews, 68, said that the IOPC told them it would take six months to conclude their investigation, during which time there was 'no reason' to suspend the officer involved in Mr Holscher-Ermert's death. She said: 'How can it take six months? Why not take the driver off the street? He is still on duty. He should be suspended now so he can't kill the next person but he gets the support of the police. He thinks he is right.' Ms Drews explained Mr Holscher-Ermert and Karl had grown up in Peacehaven and were well known by the community there. She said that the amateur footballer was full of hope for the future and had been saving to buy a house with his partner.  'He wasn't 80 years old. He was 27 with his whole life ahead of him. He was very happy. He'd found a new girlfriend and they were saving for a house together. He had so many plans for the future,' she said. 'Even though he is no longer physically here, he will always be with us - when we come together and remember him he will be present. 'When we got that phone call we just wanted to wake up, go for breakfast and call Arthur to say: 'We had a really bad dream but we are so happy you are still here.' 'We want justice. We know it will not bring Arthur back - but it will stop the man responsible from thinking he's right. He must apologise.'",
    "7d12037994e039901399ab8c33b83972a07ff24933aac5d381473345": "The Duchess of Cambridge has said no mother is 'immune to experiencing anxiety and depression' in a new video to mark becoming patron of a 'fantastic organisation' supporting the mental health of women. Kate Middleton, 40, said it was crucial for those 'struggling' to be given the 'right support at the right time' and also urged society to play its part, saying everyone needed to help 'parents and carers, and all those who are raising children today'. Her words were spoken in a video message recorded to mark her new role as patron of the Maternal Mental Health Alliance (MMHA), announced during Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week, which ends on Sunday. In the video, the royal donned a midi dress by Italian fashion brand Max Mara. The PS630 frock featured long sleeves with lace detailing down the arms and across the chest. The fabric's delicate blue floral design is printed onto a cream background. She finished the look with one of her trademark hairstyles - a down do, with gentle curls in her dark brown locks, and a soft make-up look.  The mother-of-three has focused on early years support and mental health in her royal career. The MMHA is a UK-wide charity and network of more than 100 organisations, working to ensure women and families affected by perinatal mental problems have access to high-quality comprehensive care and support. The duchess said in her video, the message of the week was about the 'power and importance of connection' and how the past two years had reminded everyone about the role of relationships in long-term health and happiness, especially at the start of life for infants. She added: 'But we all know that pregnancy, childbirth and the first months and years of a child's life can be hugely demanding. Parents often feel lonely and overwhelmed by these early years. 'Around 20 per cent  of women in the UK are reported to experience perinatal mental illness.  'Sadly, we also know that many more are suffering in silence. No one is immune to experiencing anxiety and depression during this time. 'It is crucial, therefore, that all those who might be struggling are given the right support at the right time, so that they're able to share these feelings without fear of judgment and can access the information, care and support they need to recover.' The MMHA's Everyone's Business campaign is calling for all women in the UK who experience mental health problems before, during and after pregnancy to receive the care and support their families need. The charity says around one in five women develop a mental health problem during pregnancy or within the early years after having a baby and the pandemic had increased the mental health risks new and expectant mothers face, which if untreated could have a devasting impact on a woman. Kate went on to highlight how charities have been working together to raise awareness about these issues: 'Much of this vital work has been led by the Maternal Mental Health Alliance, a fantastic organisation of which I am extremely proud to become patron of today. 'There is plenty more to be done. And it's down to each and every one of us to support parents and carers, and all those who are raising children today. 'Because by ensuring that the next generation of children can thrive, we can help to build a stronger, healthier and more nurturing society which benefits us all.' Kate has made the early years development of children one of the main pillars of her public role and her latest patronage complements the work she is trying to do through her Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood. Luciana Berger, chair of the MMHA which was founded in 2011, said they were 'honoured' Kate had become their patron. She added: 'The duchess's longstanding dedication to the early years and keen interest in mental health marry beautifully with the Alliance's mission to ensure every mum, baby and family affected by perinatal mental health problems can access the right care and support necessary. 'We look forward to working with the duchess to make this goal a reality for all.'",
    "683977e15b766d262d9cd5cb25b206c48083eae4d55bd4bd89496199": "This is the moment an e-scooter driver recklessly cuts straight into the path of an oncoming car while a child clings precariously to the base of the scooter.  Dashcam footage recorded the shock of a man and a woman when the electric scooter nearly collided with their car after whizzing around a corner in Preston, Lancashire, on Monday.  'Wow', the woman says following the near miss, before the rash driver paces ahead, straight through a red light. 'Dear god, he's got a child on that!', she added.  Audibly taken aback, the man describes the scooter drivers' conduct as 'bloody ridiculous', as his fellow passenger notes that the driver 'never looked what were behind him'. 'And they want to make them legal', the man said.  Following the incident, which occurred on Ribbleton Road, in Preston, Lancashire, one of the passengers, who wants to remain anonymous, said: 'I don't usually travel through this area. I was completely shocked and could not believe what I saw.  'I could only think it may have been a joke on the riders part and not a real child but it looked like a real child. But the ignoring the red traffic light was not a joke.' The road user said they were concerned about the legalisation of electric scooters - particularly 'some of the idiots that will be able to use them'.  'I have been in Liverpool and seen some dangerous riding of the ones on trial by the council. I believe they should not be legalised.'   Private e-scooters are due to be legalised for use on roads in Britain under new laws that will be unveiled next month, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has indicated to MPs. Currently there is no specific legislation for e-scooters and, while it is legal to buy and sell e-scooters in the UK, there are limitations on where they can be used. In April, Mr Shapps told MPs that legislation concerning e-scooters would be included in the Queen's Speech on 10th May, when the Government unveils its next legislative agenda. Appearing before the House of Commons' Transport Committee, the Transport Secretary said: 'In the future I want to crack down on the illegal use on roads of non-compliant e-scooters.' Renting an e-scooter is the only way to legally ride the vehicle on some public roads or in other public place at the moment. But the controversial vehicles could be approved for use across the UK following a trial period. Currently, 10 London boroughs are taking part in the scheme with three providers to test how e-scooters work on the capital's roads. Riding e-scooters on the pavement however is banned, and riders must be 18 or over and have a full or provisional driving licence to rent one. It is also illegal to use privately owned e-scooters or other powered transporters on public roads. Relevant laws on e-scooter use include: On public roads, anyone using a privately owned e-scooter or other powered transporter is likely to be committing at least one of a number of offences such as driving a motor vehicle with no insurance. You could be liable for a fixed penalty of PS300 and six points on your driving licence On pavements, it is generally an offence to drive a motor vehicle, and this applies at all times to e-scooters and powered transporters E-scooters and powered transporters may be used on private land with permission from the landowner or occupier E-scooters rented from the TfL scheme will be permitted to ride on London's public roads and cycle infrastructure in participating boroughs. These boroughs will designate no-go areas where e-scooters cannot be ridden and will come to a safe stop, as well as go-slow areas, where the speed of e-scooters will be reduced to 8mph Source: TfL ",
    "8231e04fb098cc0ddeb672831701444a8be67866389c599ce1708bcb": "A former high school teacher and sports coach accused of a raft of child exploitation offences allegedly recorded a child and shared a picture he took of a student, a court has been told. Lucas John Gill was arrested in July during a raid at his home in the Brisbane suburb of Chermside. Police said at the time detectives went to the property after a tip-off and alleged the teacher had been accessing child exploitation material via an overseas website that has encrypted cloud storage. They seized a laptop and a smartphone that police allege contained child exploitation material. Gill was released on bail after his first appearance on six charges, but kept in custody when police charged him with dozens more offences that allegedly occurred prior to his arrest. The 42-year-old was granted bail in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday after being in custody for seven months. In opposing Gill's bail application prosecutor Ryan Minuti said the alleged 'quantum of offending' over a long period of time were concerning. Gill faces nearly 100 charges including 61 counts of distributing child exploitation material. Mr Minuti argued Gill's conversations on a restricted app were protracted, of a sheer number and involved a large number number of people. The allegations were also not only for online offending as there were identified victims, he said. Some charges related to alleged child exploitation material made or procured during a Snapchat conversation and others involved a child allegedly recorded by Gill. Mr Minuti told the court a picture Gill took of one of his students was distributed to several people on social media. 'In my submission the defendant's offending goes beyond just internet offending and does break into the real world,' he added. Gill's lawyer Alan Phillips said the case against his client is strong and at first glance there is a 'significant and concerning case' with alleged offences committed over about five years. But he asked for Gill to be released on strict conditions that would reduce risks. Magistrate Mark Nolan released Gill on conditions including that he live with his mother, have no contact with anyone under the age of 18, have limited internet access, and take part in a sexual offending treatment program. Gill was earlier committed to stand trial in the Brisbane District Court on a date to be confirmed. He was stood down from his teaching position when arrested.",
    "23b04f4332b3135be6bfb6dd0c063949fcae8a6bd14ea72da3db137d": "Rosie Marcel has revealed she had to be rushed to the emergency room at hospital this week to undergo surgery. Taking to her Instagram on Thursday, the actress, 44, shared a series of photos from her hospital bed, including one of her lying there while connected to wires. Rosie - who is famous for her role as Jac Naylor in Holby City and its sister series Casualty - also took to the time to praise the NHS for their wonderful care of her, but didn't reveal the cause of her hospital stint. Captioning the snap, she wrote: 'Ended up at the old emergency room the other night.  'Stoke mandeville is my new local ish hospital and they were brilliant. Ambulance crew were amazing too.  'Had surgery the next day and home soon after that. Very very grateful to the nhs for looking after me and treating me quickly. #fentanyl #morphine all the good stuff!!! #nhs'. Her followers rushed to the comments to give her their well wishes and point out the obvious irony in the star ending up in hospital. One quipped: 'Do you understand some of the terminology now after being the best cardiothoracic surgeon in the world previously?' Another chimed in to add: 'Hope you get well soon. I bet you get some funny reactions when they see 'Jac Naylor' rock up'. Holby City fans were left devastated in March as the Casualty spin-off came to a dramatic conclusion in the final episode after 23 years on the BBC.  The medical drama finale focused on Rosie's character Jac, after she awoke from a life-or-death operation led by Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley) and the team to remove her brain tumour. Jac asked Adrian 'Fletch' Fletcher (Alex Walkinshaw) to write her a do-not-resuscitate order, despite Elliot telling the team that he wanted to do another operation.  Fletch said: 'I just hate the thought of you giving up,' as Jac replied: 'Let me tell you about giving up. Letting this thing take control. Wipe out my mind. Leaving me delirious and doubly incontinent - that's giving up. 'I have never been clearer about anything in my life. Please do this one thing for me.' Soon after, Jac suffered a stroke and was left braindead forcing Fletch to tell Elliot, Sacha Levy (Bob Barrett) and Max McGerry (Jo Martin) about the Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT).  Fletch explained: 'She said if anything like this happened - I think she knew that something like this was coming and she made up her mind.' Elliot said: 'It's Jac's decision. We may not like it but we have to respect it.'  It was then revealed that Jac had donated her organs to patients who needed them including a medical student, a full-time mother of four and Lexy Morrell, who received her heart.  In the closing moments, the voice of Jac could be heard in the background saying: 'It took me a long time to find a place I belonged, somewhere to call home. 'It wasn't with my mother or the carers she dumped me on when she walked out of my life, it certainly wasn't with any man, it was when I first walked into a theatre. I knew then one day one I had found my place in the world, somewhere I belonged.  'This is what the NHS means to us, not a badge on a cabinet minister's lapel, not a number down the side of a bus, it's a nurse missing her break to sit with a lonely patient, a surgeon grinding out a 15-hour op, the sound of sirens coming to the rescue, Thursday night applause sounding out the rooftops, it's all of us doing the best we can in impossible circumstances. it's something to believe in, it's home.'",
    "12fcc2608f7cfd0d41a7e08bdc2149b223e027f79d88ae6f4e04ceeb": "Sajid Javid met HRT suppliers yesterday amid growing pressure to resolve shortages of the vital medication. In a boost for the Daily Mail's campaign to fix the crisis, the Health Secretary pledged to 'leave no stone unturned' in improving supplies of hormone replacements. Thousands of women have been unable to obtain the therapy for menopause symptoms such as low mood, brain fog and hot flushes. Mr Javid and Madelaine McTernan, the new head of the HRT supply taskforce, met representatives of the supply, wholesale and community pharmacy sector. Prescriptions for HRT have more than doubled in England over the past five years, according to NHS data, leading to a huge shortage. Mr Javid's meeting came after one London-based drugs firm, Theramex, which makes hormone gels, claimed he had failed to act after being warned about the shortages last October. Tina Backhouse, the company's UK general manager, told the Daily Telegraph: 'We did speak to the Department of Health about it, about how to [fix this issue in October]. But the problem was, all people wanted to talk about was Covid.' Mr Javid met delegates of the firms Gedeon Richter, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Orion, Pfizer, Besins Healthcare, Viatris, and representatives from community pharmacies.They discussed other factors that might disrupt supply, such as manufacturing problems, capacity constraints and commercial decisions. Mr Javid said: 'I want to continue to reassure women that I am listening to their concerns. 'Meeting with key stakeholders and suppliers is one of many steps we are taking to ensure women can access the HRT they need. 'We will leave no stone unturned in our mission to boost supply of HRT. Along with appointing Madelaine McTernan as head of the HRT taskforce to implement lessons learned from the pandemic, and ensuring prescriptions are issued in shorter cycles for now, we are working collectively with the sector to urgently resolve this issue.' On Saturday, the Daily Mail launched a manifesto calling for urgent changes to the way HRT medication is prescribed, processed and distributed. It also demands an immediate curriculum change, making it mandatory for medical students to be taught about the menopause, and for women to be given menopause information at NHS health checks. Many women's symptoms have been so bad they have lost jobs or felt suicidal. Others have been forced to pay up to eight times the NHS price for HRT products at private online pharmacies or drive hours battling a postcode lottery to try to find their medication. Jane Pangbourne, founder of the HRT Truth Collective, said: 'We in the menopause support community have all been working very hard to help those who want to access HRT and, more recently, the Mail's menopause manifesto has been a big part of this.' Miss McTernan said the discussions were constructive.",
    "968505c7630fef9a88fd80037ffe2a811cf65451ce28535e42dd1207": "Britain's biggest housebuilder has slammed Michael Gove's plans to make developers pay to fix unsafe homes as 'unjust and disproportionate'. Barratt Developments boss David Thomas yesterday wrote to the Housing Secretary expressing his 'deep disappointment' that a PS3billion levy - originally aimed at firms building high-rise blocks - would now be industry wide.  It comes on top of a PS3billion developer tax, which already targets the sector. Mr Thomas also said that the expansion of the levy punishes those 'who were not responsible' for the cladding scandal. Mr Gove tore up government policy in January when he scrapped a previous loan scheme for leaseholders and said developers should bear the full cost of fixing cladding and other defects in the wake of the 2017 Grenfell fire. He also threatened to shut out building firms that refused to contribute to a new building safety fund.  More than 35 housebuilders have so far agreed to provide at least PS2billion to repair buildings taller than 11 metres. A government spokesman said that building safety 'is an industry-wide failure' and added: 'We make no apologies for making developers pay'. But Mr Thomas argued that overseas firms, as well as manufacturers, suppliers, contractors and others who had a role in the building safety crisis, 'including government itself', are 'not paying anything towards the costs of the problems they had a hand in creating'. He called for the levy to be delayed until others had been made to pay their fair share, adding: 'The unavoidable conclusion is that government is unfairly targeting established UK companies simply because it is easy to do so while finding it difficult to bring other organisations and overseas companies to account.' Barratt, which has made about PS3billion in profit since Grenfell, said it had set aside PS480million to fix unsafe homes it has built. The firm believes it will pay another PS400million through the developer tax to fix unsafe homes built by others. Giles Grover, of the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign group, said: 'It is difficult, if not impossible, to feel any sympathy for developers like Barratt - firms that have profited to the tune of billions since the Grenfell tragedy. 'However, we do not disagree with the notion that the Government has not spread the net widely enough to ensure all those who played a part in causing this crisis are made to contribute to costs of remediation.'",
    "90edfb41545c4a187fd95bd1bce64f4a2e8e211e3efc141cd415647d": "They were the men who could have changed history - if only they had disallowed the world's most famous goal in front of more than 100,000 fans.  When Diego Maradona scored his infamous 'Hand of God' goal against England in the 1986 World Cup, the match's Tunisian referee Ali Bin Nasser and his Bulgarian assistant Bogdan Dotchev exchanged hesitant glances.  Even though it was then unclear if either man had seen the Argentine's foul, it was obvious from the reaction of England's players that something was drastically wrong in the stadium in Mexico City.  But the two men did not communicate on the pitch - in part because the referee spoke French and English and Dotchev German and Spanish - and instead blamed each other for failing to act.  The goal was given and, after speaking through a translator in the dressing room after the match - which England lost following a second goal from Maradona's - Bin Nasser and Dotchev never spoke ever again. Instead, in the nearly four decades that have followed that momentous match, the two men continued to place the responsibility on each other for allowing the goal.  Dotchev, who died aged 80 in 2017 after being haunted for the rest of his life for failing to act, finally admitted in 2014 that he had seen Maradona punch the ball beyond England keeper Peter Shilton.  But he told the Bulgarian media that world governing body FIFA did not then allow assistants to discuss a decision with a referee, and added that if a European had been put in charge of the game, Maradona's goal would have been disallowed.   Bin Nasser insisted in 2001 that his assistant had been 'better placed' than him and he 'decided to trust his judgement', adding that he believed he 'had a good game'.   In an interview later in life, Bin Nasser, who is now aged 78, continued to blame Dotchev, saying that his assistant 'did not raise his flag'.  He also revealed that, for three years after the match, the Bulgarian would 'write him a little note' every year. He claimed it read: 'My brother, my colleague, there was only the hand of Shilton'.  Yesterday, the shirt that Maradona was wearing during the match against England was sold for a record-breaking PS7.1million.  The late football icon, who died in 2020 aged 60, swapped shirts with England midfielder Steve Hodge and the former player had owned the treasured item ever since until yesterday's sale.  Maradona scored his infamous goal - the first of the game - in the 51st minute of the match against England, who were managed by the late Bobby Robson.  Television replays, which were being watched by an estimated one billion people around the world, clearly showed how the player had used his left hand to push the ball above and beyond Shilton  Four minutes later, the player dribbled past five shell-shocked England players: Peter Bearsley, Peter Reid, Terry Butcher, Terry Fenwick, Butcher again and then goalkeeper Shilton.  The second strike became known as the 'Goal of the Century'.  A goal at the other end by Gary Lineker was not enough to rescue England and they lost the match 2-1.  After the match, Robson told how the first goal was 'dubious' and the second one was 'a miracle'.  'We have lost to a very good team. It is not easy and we have done the very best we could do,' he added.  The infamous handball gained its nickname after Maradona's first words following the match, in which he said the goal was made 'a little with the head of Maradona, and a little with the hand of God'.  The game was also remembered for the animosity between England and Argentina, both on the pitch and among fans. The match was being played just four years after Britain's victory in the Falklands War.  Before the football began, Argentine fans booed the England national anthem and there were sporadic skirmishes between fans during and after the game.  Reacting to the 'Hand of God' goal, Shilton said afterwards: 'It was such an obvious handball. The referee and the linesman looked at each other but neither would be positive. Maradona took a chance and got away with it.'   After the match, Bin Nasser, whose name is also spelled Bennaceur, said: 'I had to make the decision at the time, I was the spot.  'I have not watched any of the replays or looked at the paper. The referee is the man who must make up his own mind and stick by his decision. That is all there is to it. It is part of the game.'  He also claimed that he had missed the handball because haemorrhoid treatment had effected his sight.   The referee was speaking in French because of his inability to communicate in English. The language barrier also meant that he could not explain his opinions or decisions to players.  Despite Bin Nasser seeming to take responsibility for allowing the goal in his comments immediately following the match, years later he pinned the blame on Dotchev.  'I was waiting for Dotchev to give me a hint of what exactly happened but he didn't signal for a handball. And the instructions Fifa gave us before the game were clear - if a colleague was in a better position than mine, I should respect his view,' he said.  Dotchev then hit back with his claim that a European referee should have been put in charge of the game.  The 1986 tournament was Bin Nasser's sole World Cup experience. Outside of the world of football, he worked as an engineer.  Dotchev had been a professional player in the 1960s and had played in the Bulgarian first division. He also had a degree in finance.  In 2001, on the 15th anniversary of the match, Bin Nasser told an Argentine newspaper: 'After Maradona scored I hesitated for a moment, but then I saw Dotchev running towards the centre of the pitch.  'And because he was better placed than me I decided to trust his judgment. No matter what happened I still think I had a good game.' But Dotchev insisted that his counterpart was 'not well prepared enough' to referee 'such an important game'.  The Bulgarian received abuse in his home country for his part in the match, with some even calling him 'a national traitor', he said in an interview.  After his death in 2018, his widow Emily revealed he 'withdrew into himself' after the storm of controversy.  Dotchev even scrawled 'Maradona is my gravedigger' on the back of a photo of the player.   Emily claimed Bin Nasser had told her husband before the fixture 'you don't have to do any work - it will all be my calls'. 'I'll never forgive that referee and I'll never forgive Diego Maradona,' she said, according to The Sun. 'After the World Cup our life was ruined. Bogdan withdrew into himself and friends never said hello to me again. It wasn't a Hand of God for us, it was a kick in the teeth.'  Speaking in 2015, Dotchev finally admitted that he had seen Maradona's handball but claimed FIFA rulings said he should only offer his verdict to the referee if asked to do so.  'I saw the Argentinian played with hand. During those times FIFA's rules allowed to the assistant referee to give his opinion only if asked by the referee,' he said.'  'The referee admitted the goal even before taking a look at me to check the situation. We never had a communication - Bin Nasser knew only his native language.' The former referee also blamed Maradona for destroying his career and his life.  He said: 'Diego Maradona ruined my life. He is a brilliant footballer but a small man. He is low in height and as a person too.' Unlike Dotchev, Bin Nasser continued working in football and went on to become part of a committee that worked to reform Tunisian football. One of his sons also followed him into refereeing.  England midfielder Hodge was the player who unintentionally flicked the ball to Maradona before his infamous goal.  Although he has owned Maradona's shirt ever since the match, the treasure has spent the last 20 years on loan at the National Football Museum in Manchester.  It was sold at Sotheby's on Wednesday afternoon - marking a new auction record for any item of sports memorabilia. The auction house described the famous blue number 10 jersey on its website as in 'good overall condition consistent with heavy use, perspiration and athletic activity' with 'slight de-threading on hemming on the front bottom of shirt, and minor spots throughout'. Brahm Wachter, Sotheby's head of streetwear and modern collectables, said: 'This historic shirt is a tangible reminder of an important moment not only in the history of sports, but in the history of the 20th century. 'In the weeks since we announced the auction we have been inundated by sports fans and collectors alike, with a palpable excitement in the air for the duration of the public exhibition - and this unfiltered enthusiasm was echoed in the bidding. 'This is arguably the most coveted football shirt to ever come to auction, and so it is fitting that it now holds the auction record for any object of its kind.' In his autobiography, Maradona, who died in November 2020 at the age of 60, said: 'It was like beating a country, not a football team.' And in interviews in later life, he referred to the two referees in the 1986 match as 'my amigos'. In 2015, he visited Bin Nasser at his home in Tunisia and gave him one of his shirts.  The former referee posed for pictures with the signed shirt in 2020.   The previous auction record for any sports memorabilia was the original autographed manuscript of the Olympic Manifesto from 1892, which sold at Sotheby's for 8.8 million US dollars in December 2019. It emerged after the sale that Argentina want the shirt's new owner to let the shirt be exhibited in the South American country on October 30, when Maradona would have been 62.  Argentine collector Marcelo Ordas broke down in tears after losing out in the bidding process.  The buyer remained anonymous, but there are reports the shirt's new owners are from the Middle East and are linked to Manchester City. ",

The phrase made discussions 'less constructive, more polarised, and less supporting over racially progressive policies', researchers said. A more inclusive term such as 'racial inequality' was found to be better at creating a sense of shared purpose. White privilege refers to the idea that white people enjoy unearned benefits over other ethnicities due to biases in society. The University of Michigan spoke to nearly 1,000 people - 82 per cent of whom were white.  They were asked: 'Should colleges rename buildings that were named after people who actively supported X?' For half the group X was replaced with the phrase 'racial inequality' and for the others it was replaced with 'white privilege'.  The research - in the journal PLOS One - found the number supporting the cause fell by 26 percentage points when the latter was used. The study's lead author Christopher Quarles said: 'Mentioning white privilege was enough to flip white support for renaming college buildings from primarily supportive to primarily opposing.' The term first appeared in academia in the 1980s but became more widely used over the past decade amid heightened racial tensions, the study said. It came under the spotlight in the UK last year after a parliamentary report suggested teaching it in schools was 'divisive' and pitted pupils against each other. Last year, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said schools must not teach children about 'white privilege' as if it were fact. He warned it was a 'contested view' and teachers who promote it risk pushing 'partisan' politics on to pupils. The minister spoke out after a report by the Commons education committee suggested that teaching white privilege could be against the equality act. It highlighted how white working-class pupils had been neglected by the education system for 'decades'",

Among them was a man smuggled across the Channel by boat less than two months ago.  Others on the charter flight included foreign criminals who had been jailed for a total of 56 years, including for firearms and drugs offences as well as assaulting an emergency services worker. One deportee had reached the UK in the back of a lorry in 2015, while another had overstayed his visa by a year.  It was the 24th flight this year, with many in recent years disrupted by Covid and legal challenges. Last night Priti Patel said: 'This Government is committed to tackling the scourge of illegal migration, and an important element of that is the removal of those with no right to be in the UK.  'The British public rightly expect us to crack down hard on those abusing the system, and today's flight is a demonstration of that.' She added that Home Office officials 'are working at pace to finalise our first relocation flight to Rwanda' amid fears that the policy to deport migrants arriving by dinghy risks being delayed.  No10 admitted this week the plan may be months away while Boris Johnson attacked 'liberal-left lawyers' trying to block it.  Around 60 migrants crossed the Channel yesterday, bringing the week's total to more than 700.  Some 696 people arrived by small boat in the first three days of May. An alleged 'kingpin' was arrested in east London on Wednesday. Hewa Rahimpur is believed to be a 'major player' in one of the criminal networks that finds boats to take migrants from France to England.  He is now set to face justice in Belgium where he is wanted by the authorities.

    "53eb17e7dae8e133c187575619245f8e096cc182c8f61604b7944464": "Quarry workers have accidentally created a new British mountain by dumping more than a thousand tons of waste rock on an existing hill. Myrddyn Phillips, a map-maker and surveyor, said a piece of high ground at a quarry in North Wales now qualifies for mountain status. A peak called Manod Mawr North Top has been eroded by quarrying, but resulted in the formation of a second, slightly lower peak. According to Mr Phillips, who has spent 20 years surveying peaks to judge if they qualify for mountain status, the new mountain near Blaenau Ffestiniog should be added to his list of 'Welsh Highlands'. He defines the Welsh Highlands as hills in Wales that are more than 2,000ft high with a 49ft drop to the col - the saddle or ridge between two peaks. Mr Phillips said it was the first time since the list was launched in 2004 that a peak had been upgraded to mountain status because of human intervention. The surveyor, from Welshpool, said: 'The mountain was first spotted on an online map by a colleague - I was intrigued and needed to see this unusual peak myself. 'I was looking for the vertical height gain between the col and the summit. It had once been relatively flat as it connected to the Manod Mawr North Top. By quarrying that ridge, they have created a brand new peak.' Mr Phillips previously hit the headlines in 2019 when he concluded that a street in Harlech, north-west Wales was the steepest in the world - only to lose the title to New Zealand city Dunedin the following year. He said he hoped Wales's new mountain would inspire people to explore their local peaks - despite the latest edition to the 'Welsh Highlands' being on private ground. 'Since I have taken up surveying, the areas it has taken me to is fantastic. You see places you otherwise would never have discovered - some of them are so beautiful,' he said. Glyder Fawr in Snowdonia was redefined as a 'super mountain' in 2010 after surveyors found it was 1,000 metres high - not its previous measurement of 999 metres.",
    "9f66d872aff2af90fe969c397eb762e98e27f64fd9d92531ee91fd0d": "A poison attack on a Moroccan animal shelter has killed 12 dogs after poisoned meat was thrown into the charity's yard. Moroccan Animal Aid (MAA) has been forced to relocate after offal and intestines thought to have been laced with poison were eaten by the dogs after allegedly being thrown over the fence by a neighbour. Workers attempted to revive the dogs, pumping their stomachs of the meat which came out so covered in poison it made the rescuers 'eyes sting' according to founder Lucy Austin, but nine of the dogs were killed. Three more died in the months after the alleged attack, which took place during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, because there were no vets available to treat the animals. Austin said: 'The same thing happened a few months later. In that case, however, we were able to take all the dogs to the vet where they were given an antidote for the poison and were put on special medicine.' Following the pair of attacks, MAA, which is based in the Agadir region of Morocco, relocated its headquarters to a more rural area without neighbours. Austin said the first incident happened less than half an hour after workers had put the dogs out for the day.  They noticed some of the dogs were salivating, shaking and going into shock while in the garden and quickly took them out of the pen to the roof.  'We were trying to evacuate the stomachs of the dogs ourselves with charcoal and olive oil, which is a natural remedy,' Austin said, adding that no vets were available because it was Ramadan.  'Some of the dogs vomited and we found blue intestines and offal that was so soaked in poison that it was burning our eyes.' Nine dogs died hours after the poisoning while three suffered serious issues with their blood over the next three months before passing away as well.   'We found intestines and offal hanging in the trees from the back fence to one of our neighbour's house,' Austin said.  'We believe he had thrown the poison over and some of it had got caught in the trees and the dogs had obviously gone to eat it straight away in the morning because it was chicken.' MAA reported the incidents to the police, but according to Austin 'nothing happened... officers came to the shelter and took my statement and that was it, we never heard anything from them again.' Agadir police did not respond to requests for comment.    Austin said the pair of attacks were a 'catalyst' for the charity to move premises 'outside of a residential district, in a more rural area with more space'. 'We have more animals every day. We have rescues every day. We don't plan to expand but it's just what's happening. We are getting far more animals in than we have managed to get out for adoption. 'Where we can, we have moved towards vaccinating and sterilising animals and putting them back on the streets, but that is not always possible. 'Often they need long term care and once they are rehabilitated it has been too long for us to put them back on the streets so we keep them.' Austin explained MAA sends dogs to Swindon-based dog charity SN Dogs to help get the animals adopted outside of Morocco, clearing the shelter for new arrivals. 'We hope to complete the move across to the new premises as soon as possible, within 12 months, so we can get away from the threat of poison, but it is really a case of financial support. 'The more money we have the more likely we are going to be able to hire the right people to build the spaces that we need to accommodate the dogs in the manner that they deserve.' MAA are fundraising here.  ",
    "d16af0a8a25c0080734a1c1425c1424916a5e5902e7b53a685286bb0": "Workers face a record squeeze on their incomes as surging inflation threatens to drive the UK into recession. In a grim assessment, the Bank of England slashed growth forecasts and predicted a double-digit rise in the cost of living. It said the economy would shrink from the end of this year as soaring bills leave struggling households with less cash to spend. It predicted that employees would see their post-tax pay fall by 3.25 per cent on average in real terms in 2022 - the biggest drop since records began in 1990. And the Bank said it now expected inflation to peak above 10 per cent within months, a 40-year high. This is five times the official inflation target of 2 per cent and the highest level since 1982, when Margaret Thatcher was only in her first term as prime minister. Why is inflation a problem? Red-hot inflation means prices of everyday goods can soar out of reach for the poor, as it erodes the value of money. At 10 per cent it means PS10 taken from an ATM last Christmas will be worth PS9 this Christmas in terms of what it buys. Firms may lay off staff to cut costs, boosting unemployment and hitting living standards and economic output. What's the risk of a high base rate? As the Bank of England lifts its base rate, high street lenders will also raise their interest rates. For borrowers and mortgage holders, the cost of their debt will rise. But for savers who have struggled to make a return, higher rates will give them a little more. Why is inflation so high? The main contributor to inflation is energy costs. Oil and gas prices were rising, but the war in Ukraine pushed them higher as the West shuns Russian supplies. Covid curbs in China, the world's manufacturing hub, add to a supply shortage. What can be done about it? The BofE keeps a lid on inflation by raising its base interest rate to encourage saving rather than spending. But because this bout of inflation is driven by the energy crisis rather than consumer demand there is little it can do.  Experts warned the UK was on course for a bout of 'stagflation', where output stagnates but prices soar. This is worrying for households because it often comes with higher unemployment. The cost of living crisis will put the brakes on consumer spending, throwing the Covid recovery into reverse, the Bank said. This will cause the economy to shrink by 0.25 per cent next year, down from previous predictions it would grow by 1.25 per cent. In another worry for households feeling the pinch, rock-bottom levels of unemployment will begin to rise as cash-strapped businesses are forced to cut their costs. The Bank thinks joblessness will be back up to 5.5 per cent within three years, from a low of 3.6 per cent this summer. Responding to the downbeat forecasts, traders sold off the pound, leading to it slumping by more than 2 per cent against the dollar to a near two-year low of $1.23. American stock markets tumbled yesterday after the US Federal Reserve raised its own interest rate by 0.5 percentage points on Wednesday. The grim outlook will pile fresh pressure on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to help households following a string of deeply unpopular tax rises - particularly if yesterday's local elections go against the Tories. Boris Johnson and his ministers are expected to meet next week to discuss how they can ease the cost of living crisis. This week the Prime Minister suggested the Government would announce further support for struggling families, admitting: 'There is more that we can do.' In an attempt to keep a lid on soaring prices, the Bank hiked interest rates again yesterday to 1 per cent - the highest level since 2009. Central banks usually increase interest rates when prices are rising fast in a bid to encourage saving rather than spending. This was the Bank's fourth rise since December - the first time its policymakers have moved so aggressively since they gained independence from the Treasury 25 years ago. Three members of the nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates, even voted for a further rise, to 1.25 per cent. But despite the Bank's action, households will still feel the pain. On one measure overall living standards are set to slump by 1.75 per cent this year as wage growth fails to keep up with the leap in prices. This would be the worst hit to family budgets since 2011, when real disposable income fell by 2.5 per cent. Yesterday's rate hike will be painful for borrowers and mortgage holders, who will see the cost of their debt rise. Bank governor Andrew Bailey said: 'I recognise the hardship that this will cause.' But his deputy Ben Broadbent emphasised that the hit to households from rising interest rates would be tiny compared with the inflation shock they were already suffering. Mr Sunak earlier this year pushed ahead with controversial tax grabs, despite warnings from economists. He has raised national insurance contributions, frozen income tax and inheritance tax thresholds and failed to lift the state pension in line with inflation. Julian Jessop, an economist at the Institute for Economic Affairs, said: 'There is never a good time to raise taxes, but now is terrible. The tax cuts announced in the spring statement undid just a sixth of the overall increases announced by Rishi Sunak since he became Chancellor. At the very least, the Government needs to take more action on energy prices by the autumn to prevent the Bank's gloomy economic forecasts from becoming reality.' Just before the Bank gave its statement, Shell reported record profits of PS7.3billion for the first three months of the year, sparking fresh calls for a windfall tax. Critics of Mr Sunak have argued that he should be heaping some of the inflation burden on to firms gaining from it, rather than leaving households to shoulder the load. Bosses at supermarkets surveyed by the Bank predicted that food prices could shoot up by more than 8 per cent this year. Combined with rising energy prices, this will disproportionately affect low-income households, which tend to spend a far greater portion of their cash on food and bills. Clothes retailers surveyed by the Bank said they might have to raise their prices by between 5 per cent and 8 per cent. Energy prices accounted for most of the inflation surge, the Bank said.",

The four criminals were filmed as they calmly left the upmarket Paris store yesterday morning after filling up their bags with designer goods. One astonished witness, who filmed the drama and posted it online, could be heard saying: 'That's a hold-up.' The robbers wore helmets with the visors down as they raided the boutique on the Place Vendome in central Paris. The square is also home to the Ministry of Justice. 'There did not seem to be any security in the store,' said another witness. 'The men pulled up on two bikes, and walked in. They got everyone in the store to lie on the floor, and then loaded up on jewellery and luxury watches. Then they left on their bikes with one of the gang showing off his assault rifle.' Chanel did not disclose the value of the goods taken, and the police, who cordoned off the area shortly after the robbery, have said they have no information on the identity of the criminals. In July, thieves made off with goods worth almost PS2million from a Chaumet store near the Champs-Elysee. A shop run by jewellery brand Dinh Van was hit in the same month. Speaking about the latest raid, police said at least one of the four, who were all masked and wore helmets, carried an assault rifle, with a witness saying that the others also had automatic weapons. In a scene that was filmed by a bystander and widely shared on social media, three people are seen dressed in black leaving the boutique while a fourth, carrying an assault rifle on a shoulder strap, waited on a motorcycle. A witness, 26-year-old Anastasia Martino who works in a clothes store across from Chanel said she was on a cigarette break when she noticed 'a man with a Kalashnikov on a motorbike', at around 2:30 pm. 'Two minutes later, three other men left the boutique carrying big black bags. They, too, had automatic weapons, got on two motorbikes and left in a hurry.' Her colleague, 31-year-old Cyril Ngo, said the heist lasted a full 10 minutes. 'These weren't professionals,' he said. The Chanel shop is located on Rue de La Paix, close to Place Vendome, an area with a high concentration of luxury jewellery stores. Chanel, founded in 1910 by Coco Chanel, is one of France's leading fashion houses, selling haute couture and ready-to-wear clothes, perfumes, accessories and other luxury items.",

Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Heineken products made up 23 per cent of brand name rubbish found by volunteers during a clean-up project. The drinks industry was the largest polluter in both 2020 and 2021 - responsible for more than a third of waste found, according to a report. Some 85,326 pieces of rubbish were recorded in the UK last year by more than 5,400 users of the Planet Patrol app. The app allows litter-pickers to record any refuse they find - and this is the third year Planet Patrol has released a report on the total amount of waste discovered and the companies behind the dumped items.  In all three years, Coca-Cola produced the most branded litter, accounting for more than one in ten pieces logged. As well as cola, the firm also owns brands such as Fanta and bought the Costa coffee chain in 2019. Planet Patrol wants the Government to support an 'all in' deposit return scheme in which customers pay a small fee when buying drinks bottles and cans. The deposit is then returned when the empty containers are taken to a collection point. Planet Patrol founder Lizzie Carr said: 'If the UK Government is sincere in its ambition to be a world leader in tackling pollution, then... solutions like the deposit return scheme and extended producer responsibility reform must be implemented as a priority.'  The Daily Mail has highlighted the scourge of litter for many years through its Turn The Tide On Plastic campaign. A Heineken UK spokesman said it was already removing plastic from its packaging, adding: 'Our 'Green Grip' eradicates the need for plastic rings on cans, instead providing a totally recyclable and compostable cardboard solution.' A Coca-Cola Great Britain spokesman said: 'We're committed to reducing plastic waste and we don't want to see any of our packaging end up where it shouldn't.' PepsiCo declined to comment.",
    "ed6c69869cac5ad79b0a233f3910083ae7ef011ca5089df2c7f76282": "A shadowy Russian hacking group has threatened to shut down ventilators at British hospitals after an alleged member of their gang was arrested in the UK.  The hacker, 23, was arrested in Tottenham, north London on Monday after Romanian government websites were attacked.  Now, members of the sinister Killnet Russian hacking group have demanded his release and threatened to target life-saving ventilators if their demands aren't met.  It is unclear if Killnet are supported by the Russian government - though spy agencies from the Five Eyes alliance - made up of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and US - have described it as a Russian-aligned group acting in the Kremlin's interests. According to the Sun, cyber crime sources have described the attack threat as being credible.   The hacker, who has not been named, is a vocal supporter of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Facebook. He has posted Russian flags and the letter Z, a symbol present on tanks used in the invasion.  The warning from Killnet, posted on the Telegram messaging site, said: 'If he is not released within 48 hours I will destroy your Romania, Great Britain and Moldova. 'I will destroy your entire information structure and even your Ministry of Health. All ventilators will be attacked. 'Appropriate response. Only then will you begin to realise the mistake you have made.' The hacker is said to have been arrested by National Crime Agency officers alongside officials from Romania.  He is under suspicion of insisting Killnet's attacks on Romanian infrastructure.  The group targeted the Romanian government and media over their support for Ukraine amid the war.  The arrested hacker is believed to have already been released under investigation. A source told The Sun last night: 'The UK has robust cyber security measures in place and, working with partners, the NCA would lead an appropriate response to any cyber crime incident having a significant impact on the UK.' It comes after Western intelligence agencies warned Russian state-sponsored hackers are targeting critical infrastructure - and cautioned that working from home increases the risk of a successful attack. An alert was issued by agencies from the Five Eyes alliance - made up of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and US. They said that Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the imposition of Western sanctions on Moscow, had increased the risk of 'malicious cyber activity'. The warning highlighted the activities of Russia state-sponsored hackers and also cybercrime groups that have recently publicly pledged support to Vladimir Putin's regime. The Five Eyes cybersecurity agencies urged those working in critical infrastructure to 'prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats'. Russian-linked cybercrime groups were said to have targeted critical IT systems, health services, a nuclear power plant, an airport, and government networks. As well as Russian FSB and GRU cyber teams, the Five Eyes agencies also explained how many Russian-aligned groups had been acting in the Kremlin's interests. These include groups named as Killnet, Mummy Spider, Salty Spider and The Xaknet Team. In their advice on how to mitigate against the Russian cyber threat, the agencies urged organisations to update software and enforce multi-factor authentication 'to the greatest extent possible'. They also issued a warning about the use of remote desktops and 'other potentially risky services'. Remote dekstops are commonly used for working from home and allows a user to connect to a computer in another location. The Five Eyes alert stated: 'RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) exploitation is one of the top initial infection vectors for ransomware, and risky services, including RDP, can allow unauthorized access to your session using an on-path attacker.' They suggested that RDP only be used if deemed 'operationally necessary'. The warning will increase fears that UK civil servants working from home could leave Government networks more vulnerable to an attack. The Foreign Office was reported to have begun an urgent investigation on Tuesday night into a suspected cyber hack after personal information about Government employees appeared on Russian social media sites.  Cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg is currently leading a government drive get civil servants back to their desks after the Covid pandemic. He was this week claimed to have conducted a personal headcount of officials in one Whitehall office. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Steve Barclay, the minister responsible for cyber security, told the Telegraph: 'Cyber attacks recognise no physical or geographical boundary and it has never been more important to plan and invest in cyber resilience.'",

The reality star, 31, shared a brief romance with the England and Manchester City defender and they have a two-year-old son called Kairo. The exes welcomed him in April 2020 after conceiving the youngster during a short relationship amid Kyle's temporary split from his longtime girlfriend, Annie Kilner who he secretly married late last year.  Meanwhile, Walker, 31, was substituted off during Man City's Champions League semi-final clash against Real Madrid last night which saw Pep Guardiola's side capitulate 6-5 on aggregate. Kyle and Lauryn have had a complicated co-parenting relationship over the past few years. Last summer, Lauryn lashed out at Kyle after the defender unveiled a pair of bespoke football boots bearing the names of each of his children - but not Kairo.  Last month, Lauryn took a swipe at Kyle after the footballer was caught urinating on the wall of a PS260-a-night hotel.  She quipped that their son 'isn't the only one who needs to be potty trained' after news emerged of the incident. Horrified guests caught Kyle urinating on the hotel wall instead of using toilets inside after he was spotted in a beer garden. The incident happened outside The Bridge in Prestbury, Cheshire, at about 3.25pm on Sunday April 17 - approximately 24 hours after his side lost in the FA Cup semi-final to Liverpool at Wembley Stadium. Guests at the hotel reported seeing the left-back looking around before pulling up his hoody and relieving himself against a wall. One said Walker was still recognisable from an eagle tattoo seen poking out of his socks.  A guest at the hotel told the Sun: 'I had just arrived for a meal with my family and suddenly I'm watching Kyle Walker, who I instantly recognised, p***ing against a wall.  'It was revolting. It wasn't just a quick wee. He was there for ages. We were appalled.' The newspaper reported that Walker had been seen in a beer garden earlier in the day. A source said the footballer walked through an archway at the hotel and 'relieved himself against the wall in full view of paying guests and people coming and going in the car park'. There is no general law making public urination a criminal offence but it is usually included in the by-laws of individual local authorities and can lead to fines of up to PS80. MailOnline approached Manchester City for comment at the time.",
    "63bfd105aa263cfaa64b900aebc8d0e5e30b2e7d65560181f4167735": "One person died in Iraq and more than 5,000 were treated in hospitals Thursday for respiratory problems due to a sandstorm, the seventh in a month, the health ministry said. Residents of six of Iraq's 18 provinces, including Baghdad and the vast western region of Al-Anbar, awoke once again to a thick cloud of dust blanketing the sky. As the storm swept across Iraq, it shrouded the capital Baghdad and the holy city of Najaf in ghostly orange clouds of choking dust. Duststorms have increased dramatically in frequency in Iraq in recent years, driven by soil degradation and intense droughts made worse by climate change, with rising average temperatures and sharply lower rainfall.  'One death has been recorded in Baghdad' and hospitals 'have received no less than 5,000 cases so far,' health ministry spokesman Seif al-Badr said in a statement. Those hit hardest are people suffering from 'chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma', and the elderly who suffer in particular from heart ailments, he said. Badr added that the majority had since been discharged and most cases were of 'medium or low intensity'. Dust and sandstorms have always occurred in the Middle East but grown more frequent and intense in recent years, a trend that has been associated with overuse of river water, more dams, overgrazing and deforestation. The fine dust particles can cause health problems such as asthma and cardiovascular ailments, and also spread bacteria and viruses as well as pesticides and other toxins. Authorities in Al-Anbar and Kirkuk provinces, north of the capital, urged people 'not to leave their homes', said the official INA news agency. The storms are expected to grow more intense with worsening climate change because higher temperatures and more irregular rainfalls dry out land faster and accelerate desertification. Sandstorms also cause economic damage by reducing visibility, sometimes to near zero, shuttering airports and highways and causing damage to buildings, vegetation and solar panels.   Hospitals in Al-Anbar province had received more than 700 patients with breathing difficulties, said Anas Qais, a health official cited by INA. The central province of Salaheddin reported more than 300 cases, while Diwaniya and the province of Najaf, south of Baghdad, each recorded about 100 cases, the news agency added. Oil-rich Iraq, despite its mighty Tigris and Euphrates rivers, is classified as one of the world's five countries most vulnerable to climate change and desertification. Scientists say climate change amplifies droughts and that their intensity and frequency in turn threaten food security. Experts have said these factors threaten to bring social and economic disaster in the war-scarred country. In November, the World Bank warned Iraq - a country of 41 million people - could suffer a 20-percent drop in water resources by 2050 due to climate change. The United Nations says about one-third of Iraq's population now lives in poverty. The effects of low rainfall have been exacerbated as the levels of the Tigris and Euphrates drop because of upstream dams in neighbouring Iran and Turkey. In early April, a government official warned Iraq could face '272 days of dust' a year in coming decades. The environment ministry said the weather phenomenon could be addressed by 'increasing vegetation cover and creating forests that act as windbreaks'.",
    "e70f1c1ef972e3bdc01a68d446c072231f9e9ce411675c82bdb4ec61": "At least three people have been killed in an attack in the central Israeli city of Elad today, health officials said. Police said they suspect it was a militant attack and that the assailant fled in a vehicle. Security forces set up roadblocks in the area around where the killings occurred, and a helicopter could be seen hovering over the area.  One of the assailants was said to have been carrying an axe, although this has yet to be confirmed by police.  Elad's mayor, speaking on television, called on residents to stay indoors while security forces were still operating. The Magen David Adom emergency service said three people were killed and four others were wounded; two of the wounded were in serious condition. The Palestinian militant group Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, praised the attack and linked it to violence at a holy site in Jerusalem, but did not claim responsibility for it. 'The storming of Al-Aqsa Mosque can't go unpunished,' Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said. 'The heroic operation in Tel Aviv is a practical translation of what the resistance had warned against.' Israel marked its Independence Day today, a festive national holiday in which people typically hold barbecues and attend air shows. Irael's Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said 'the joy of independence day had been interrupted in an instant,' condemning the 'murderous attack in Elad.' The identity of the assailant was not yet known. But Israeli-Palestinian tensions have soared in recent weeks, following a series of attacks in Israel, military operations in the occupied West Bank and violence at the holy site in Jerusalem. The Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is the third holiest site in Islam and is built on a hilltop that is the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount. It lies at the emotional heart of the conflict, and Palestinians and Israeli police have clashed there repeatedly in recent weeks. Israeli police entered the site to clear away Palestinian protesters on Thursday, after Jewish visits that had been paused for the Muslim holidays resumed. As the visits resumed, dozens of Palestinians gathered, chanting 'God is greatest.' Scuffles broke out when the police went to arrest one of them.  Police fired rubber-coated bullets on the sprawling esplanade as some Palestinians sheltered inside the mosque itself. The police could later be seen just inside an entrance to the barricaded mosque. The police said they responded to dozens of people who were shouting incitement and throwing stones, and that one police officer was lightly injured. The Palestinian Red Crescent emergency service said two Palestinians were taken to a hospital after being struck with batons. Unlike in previous confrontations, Palestinian witnesses said there was no rock-throwing initially. Some of those who sheltered inside the mosque began throwing stones and other objects when police entered the building. The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns. Under informal arrangements known as the status quo, Jews are allowed to visit the site but not pray there.  In recent years, they have visited in ever-increasing numbers with police escorts and many have discreetly prayed, angering the Palestinians as well as neighboring Jordan, which is the custodian of the site.  The Palestinians have long feared that Israel plans to eventually take over the site or partition it. Israel says it is committed to maintaining the status quo, and accuses the Islamic militant group Hamas of inciting the recent violence.",
    "c8c64256fbc34dcbba9d386505bc2657c812d883fa99ad17818692c4": "Countdown star Rachel Riley has told how a celebrity brazenly put his phone under her to upskirt her while she was playing table tennis with her former Strictly dance pro husband Pasha Kovalev. The star, 36, also revealed that when a charity checked her Instagram direct messages, which she never looks at, they found a torrent of trolling hate and vile sexual content, including 30 videos from one man masturbating. Riley slammed social media giants for not stopping it and called on them to face the same controls as the normal media, while hailing the forthcoming Online Harms Bill. Riley said: 'One who shall remain nameless, who people would know, he just got an Apple Watch, and at a party at a friend's house, I was playing table tennis with Pash, and this guy, in full view of everyone, came, put his phone on the floor under my skirt where I was playing table tennis, and went and sat back down a couple of metres away while him and all his mates looked at his watch. 'It was like a video basically. So he went and put his phone down so he could look up and went two metres away to go and look at his phone, look up my skirt.' She told the Dirty Mother Pukka' podcast on Thursday: 'I wouldn't call him a friend, but you would know him. I was too polite. 'Now, being able to digest it and think about it, if someone tried to do that to me again I would break their phone. 'If they've got a problem with that, they can go to the police and we can deal with it in the public. 'That a man obviously thought he could get away with blatantly, brazenly putting his phone, upskirting me on a video for his friends on his phone, and it would be fine! 'Now I would just break his phone and deal with it afterwards.' She continued: 'But at that time Pasha went up, picked his phone up, and politely went and took it to him, and just gave him a really awful look like 'what the hell are you doing?' 'I think the days of being polite, meek and mild, to someone who wants to grab you, nah, done with that.' Riley also told of the sick social media comments and messages she receives and called for action to protect teenage girls in particular. Rachel who has faced a barrage of anti-semitism for speaking out against it, said: 'I'm an ambassador for a charity called the Centre for Countering Digital Hate, who I think are the best people in the entire world, I absolutely love them. And they said to me 'can we look at your Instagram DMs because we want to see what's in there?' 'And I don't check my Instagram DMs. I've got so much social media in my life, emails, WhatsApps, friends' kids, even if I wanted to, I don't have time. 'So they looked at my Instagram DMs, and they found I think one guy had sent like 30 something videos of himself w**king. 'And they gave me the details of like some of the things he was saying. 'It's not that I'm upset that I've got it, it's the thinking that my friends' teenage girls are on this platform. 'And especially DMs, because no-one else can see it, and I think I've obviously had a lot of trolling on Twitter from activism stuff and anti-semitism stuff, and the thing about being trolled you're the only one that really sees all of it. 'And no-one can understand what's it's like to have that level of trolling, and that many people saying things, or sending you things. 'It's very, very lonely. And to think that there are teenage girls. It's one of the most vulnerable times in your life. 'We know that teenage girls are really susceptible to external opinions of them or pressures. 'And to thing that randomers can send them videos of themselves w**king. And that Instagram finds that acceptable. Because they've got the technology - they're owned by Meta, Facebook, they can look at an image and describe it for visually impaired people and say 'this is a dog on a beach'. 'They're really proud that they've got this technology, yet they allow random people that you don't follow to send you w***ing videos. 'There's no money in it for them to not. 'So one of my big things that I like to bang my drum about is supporting CCDH and the Online Harms Bill to actually make social media liable like the regular media is. 'And I didn't realise it was a thing that people have little chat groups. So you can imagine the worst chat groups that a bunch of people might have, sending like the worst stuff, and they just add celebrities in for chits and giggles presumably. And they send literally violent videos. Upskirting is where someone takes a picture under a person's clothing without their permission.  It is now a specific criminal offfence in England and Wales. The law was introduced in February 2019.   Perpetrators will face two years in prison. By criminalising this distressing practice, it is hoped that it deters people from committing the crime. Upskirting, where committed to obtain sexual gratification, can result in the most serious offenders being placed on the sex offenders register. The new law will send a clear message that such behaviour is criminal and will not be tolerated. Source: Gov.uk    'They think of the worst things you can find on the internet and they'll post them in their little chats and send them to celebrities. And it's just weird and horrible. 'It's not the worst thing in the world, but when I contextualise it in terms of the teenage daughters of my friends, and knowing how vulnerable some of them are, it's a big problem with the next generation I think. 'I really, really hope there's a new form of something. 'There's no reason why doing something online shouldn't be treated in exactly the same way as if you did it in the street. 'Cyber flashing is literally just being made a crime. If you went down the street and you were w***king in front of girls, whoever, you would be arrested. Why should you be able to do it online?' 'We've got the Online Harms Bill coming, which I think will be a real step forward.' It comes after Anne Robinson recently revealed she quit Countdown following a pay dispute and addressed reports of 'rift' between herself and Rachel and Susie Dent. And Rachel has now seemingly made a swipe at her former co-star, 77, as she took to Instagram on Wednesday to share a cryptic post. The TV presenter shared a selfie of herself sporting a strawberry-print dress and flashing a huge grin as she enjoyed a glass of wine at home. Alongside the photograph, she made a thinly veiled swipe at Anne as she wrote that she was 'toasting' the 'next chapter in Countdown's history'. She penned: 'Drinking a toast to the next chapter in Countdown's history... I think you're going to like it!' Rachel's apparent jibe comes after Anne admitted that Rachel is 'noisy' and that she 'wouldn't go on holiday' with her, but dismissed claims of a feud after she quit Countdown. It was revealed that Anne was leaving the show after just one year earlier this week by The Daily Mail's Alison Boshoff, and Anne has since said she quit over a pay dispute. The presenter, who was employed on a freelance basis, admitted that despite being offered a pay rise, she did not want to join Channel 4's payroll and so decided to walk away from her role as host. Speaking to The Sun, she confessed: 'I come from a long line of alcoholic, Irish bandits so to suggest I go PAYE is a bit like asking Philip Green or Richard Branson to join the company payroll. 'I wasn't interested in any offer on that basis. Even if it included financial parity. I will, however, miss out on the Channel 4 luncheon vouchers, which is a big regret.' Speaking with Emma Barnett on Radio 4's Woman's Hour, she added: 'I marched so that your generation would be really clever at negotiating your salaries and your pay, and you're all absolutely hopeless at it. Why? It's so easy. There's about six steps to getting the money you want.' Anne continued: 'What happens is some bloke comes in with his friend, gives you the interview and says 'we're going to pay you this', you say 'thank you very much'.  'What you have to realise, they go outside and they do high fives because you've accepted the first offer.' Of the rift with her co-stars Rachel and Susie Dent, she admitted that she had been annoyed by their time-keeping and noisiness. But she later said: 'They're both brilliant at what they do. I mean they really, really are. Channel 4 are incredibly lucky to have them. And there isn't a rift. 'It was me wanting everyone to be quiet in the studio. I like everyone turning up on time and quiet, quiet, quiet. So we did have to iron that out. But that's it.' Anne continued: 'I think we all came to an agreement that we would have mics off before we went into a record, which gave me time to have a chat with the contestants - that's all - and remind them what their hobbies are.' Describing Rachel, she said: 'She is brilliant at those numbers, what else can I say.' On the prospect of retirement, the former Weakest Link host said: 'I haven't got any practice at it. Maybe I'll start doing social media. 'You know what the Queen says, mostly to women, she says 'what's keeping you busy?' And that's because they might not have a job so they can say 'I'm playing the piano, I'm doing my garden'. So I'm going to practice how I explain I don't have a job.' Anne continued: 'It's the first time I've never had a job. It's also the first time I haven't seen a job on the horizon. I've given myself a really big talking to and I'm 78 this year and I've really got to learn about retirement. 'I've encouraged television bosses to realise that not all women at the wrong end of their 70s are in care homes playing bingo and watching conjuring tricks.' Meanwhile, former Countdown host Nick Hewer did not hold back when recently taking a swipe at his ex-colleague Susie after she wished Anne well on Twitter. It came amid claims that the cast are 'relieved' she is leaving after reports of an on-set feud with Rachel and Susie. But Susie appeared to dismiss any feud claims by sending a congratulatory message to 'wish her the best' as she moved on to pastures new. The lexicographer, who has appeared in Countdown's Dictionary Corner since 1992, wrote on Twitter: 'Some Countdown news. 'Wishing Anne all the very best in her new adventures with her grandchildren and beyond.' However, Nick, 78, accused her of 'sucking up' to her former colleague and told her she would be a prime candidate for a 'brown nosing' award.  He responded to her tweet, writing: 'Well that's a sure fire certainty for Private Eye's OBN [Order of the Brown Nose] award. Bravo Susie!'  Richard Osman has been tipped as the early favourite to replace Anne on Countdown after the host announced she was stepping down. TV star Richard, 51, recently quit his show Pointless after 13 years so would be free to take on new commitments.  One insider told The Mirror: 'Everyone is so relieved, to be honest. It's all been a bit of a disaster with the fallouts and squabbles, we just want to draw a line under it and move on.'  Meanwhile, Ladbrokes have said that Richard currently has 3/1 odds of replacing Anne on Countdown. After Richard, the next strongest odds for replacements go to comedian Susan Calman and Taskmaster star Alex Horne, both of whom have 4/1 odds. Writer Victoria Coren Mitchell is next with 9/2 odds, while 8 Out Of 10 Cats star Jon Richardson follows with 11/2 odds. Richard said in his statement last month when he quit Pointless: 'I will miss everyone so much, but I'm thrilled that I'll still be presenting the celebrity shows. I can't thank everyone enough for twelve amazing years.' Representatives for Anne and Richard have been contacted by MailOnline for a comment. And it seemed that Rachel placed her seal of approval on the words, as she retweeted the post from pal Susie.  But while the TV stars put on a friendly display through social media, it comes after reports last year that Anne, who suffers from tinnitus, found Rachel 'too loud' and was 'irritated by her habit of chatting on her mobile phone, and by her time-keeping'. Opening up to Alison Boshoff for the Daily Mail, Anne admitted that Rachel is noisy and that she 'wouldn't go on holiday' with her - but dismissed claims of a feud. The Weakest Link host explained: 'I'm not saying I would go on holiday with Rachel Riley, but she is brilliant,' she said. 'Absolutely honestly, I do admire her - she is really, really good at what she does, as is Susie Dent.  'Look, Rachel has just come back from having a baby and she is standing throughout and faultless, whereas I get to sit down. She is noisy, yes she and Susie both are - they are a formidable pair those two. But there isn't a question of my going because of a rift, that's nonsense.'  She also explained that the three women 'barely talk' during the show, detailing: 'The way that it's filmed is so tight that... we don't have time to talk to each other.' Representatives for Rachel Riley declined to comment at the time. Anne told Alison that she is leaving the show as her contract was only one year long, and she 'didn't realise how much time it would take up'.  Explaining that she's swapping the 'intense' filming schedule for some downtime at home, Anne said:  'I am moving on because I've got a lot going on - grandchildren, a big garden, an apartment in New York - and I want to enjoy them. Countdown has taken up more of time than I thought it would.' 'It is great fun but it is intense. I go up [to Media City in Salford] and we do 15 shows in three 11-hour days. I'm built to last so I don't really mind, but it does take up quite a chunk of my time,' she added. A spokesperson for the Channel 4 daytime show gushed over Anne after the announcement of her leaving, saying: 'Quick-witted Anne has been a brilliant host on this iconic show.'",
    "6cebf5fabf4c8dd75dcb6c35ce5fd98de79201bc6b7808f288ca686c": "Socialite James Stunt spent 'astonishing' sums while married to Petra Ecclestone including more than PS800,000 on Lamborghinis and turned to a PS266million laundering scheme when the 'river of money was running dry' with the break-up of their marriage, a court heard. Despite his claims to be a billionaire in his own right, 40-year-old Stunt's personal finances are 'shrouded in mystery' suggested prosecutor Nicholas Clarke QC as Stunt stood trial for money laundering charges. Mr Clarke pointed out glaring discrepancies between official tax and business records detailing Stunt's income, but said he had access to 'unlimited resources' when he was married to F1 heiress Petra Ecclestone, through their joint account. But when Stunt wanted to set up his own 'branded gold bar' investment business, he had to turn to his billionaire father-in-law to stand as guarantor. Mr Clarke said: 'If Stunt were the billionaire that he claims then there would be no need for the outside guarantee at all. It is only the impecunious that need such a third-party financial crutch to support them.' Stunt is one of eight defendants accused of money laundering at Leeds Cloth Hall Court by being involved in depositing 'criminal cash' in the account of Bradford gold dealer Fowler Oldfield. Prosecutors say the cash was brought into business addresses owned or managed by the defendants between January 2014 and September 2016. The jury heard that Stunt spent 'astonishing' sums during his marriage to Petra Ecclestone, including more than PS800,000 on Lamborghinis.  Mr Clarke said: 'Backed by his father-in-law's wealth, Stunt was able to establish business support, and through his marriage he had access to his wife's money. 'There is evidence of transfers of large amounts from her accounts into his. They also had joint accounts that, effectively, had unlimited resources.  A courier at the heart of James Stunt's PS266million money laundering enterprise used his hat as a glove, gripped notes with his knuckles and stashed a secret 'code word' in his sock to avoid being linked to 'criminal behaviour', a court heard. The jury at the socialite's trial was shown the CCTV video of the suspect who delivered PS200,000 in notes to the Fowler Oldfield 'counting room' in Bradford as the prosecution detailed its case against eight people in the dock.  Prosecutor Nicholas Clarke QC told the jury that the footage of a man handling cash was taken long before the pandemic, so there was only one reason to wipe down surfaces. He said: 'This was not legitimate business. This was criminal behaviour. A criminal delivering the proceeds of crime and well aware of forensic traces he might leave'.  James Stunt, the former husband of heiress Petra Ecclestone, is alleged to have been at the heart of the money laundering scheme to turn criminal cash into gold.  Newly released footage showed a particularly careful courier is shown covering up any forensic evidence of his presence at every stage. The unidentified man is shown arriving at the Bradford office on August 19, 2016, carrying a holdall stuffed with cash. He handles parcels using the heels of his hands or his closed knuckles, so as not to leave fingerprints, and used his cloth cap as a makeshift glove. He then wipes down the packaging with his cloth cap, and wipes down every surface he has touched, with the cap, his sleeves or a tissue. The courier was given what the prosecution claimed was a code word used in the alleged money-laundering operation, on a scrap of paper and tore the paper into small pieces and stuffed them into his sock. A little later, he went to the toilet, but again wiped down every surface, including the bolt lock on the cubicle. 'He has been able to write cheques on and arrange transfers from his personal account for truly astonishing sums of money. His charitable payments include a PS10,000 donation to the Princes Trust in June 2014, PS25,000 to The Great Steward of Scotland Dumfries House Trust (where part of his art collection was on loan) in August 2015 and another PS25,000 in December of the same year. 'Unicef received PS40,000 in October 2015 and then PS301,000 in the following month. He paid PS316,000 to Lamborghini in July 2015, another EUR260,000 [EUROS] in the November and then PS359,000 in January 2016. 'There are also high value art purchases from galleries and auction houses.' Mr Clarke added that Stunt has enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle, although his own personal finances are 'shrouded in mystery'. 'Bank account opening records and applications for finance suggest that he has extraordinarily high wealth and income. 'On closer examination, it has been impossible to verify any of the details set out on the applications and forms. When questions have been asked he could not answer them.' Mr Clarke added: 'James Stunt is no longer married to Petra Ecclestone and given the breakdown in his marriage and the fact that the river of money from the Ecclestone sources may have been running dry, the financial future for Stunt may have appeared to him less abundant than it had been. 'This might be an explanation as to why he got involved in a process that has been demonstrably proven to have involved the laundering of millions of pounds of cash.' Mr Clarke said that when initially questioned about his involvement in the money laundering network, he made no reply, but later his lawyers submitted a lengthy document divided into chapters. The prosecutor told the court: 'The documents... seek to portray him as a man of exceedingly high wealth with virtually unlimited income and who could have had no possible motive to launder money. 'It is claimed that he earns a very significant income and makes enormous capital gains from his investments. 'He is presented as a successful entrepreneur who spots a business opportunity, sets up the business and financing, but then leaves all the detail to others who are left with the responsibility of making it happen without close oversight from him. 'He claims that if he had the slightest suspicion that anything illegal was being done in relation to his venture with Fowler Oldfield then he would have walked away.' But official records from HMRC and Companies House told a different story, the jury heard. He said the tax records exposed gaps in the history and apparent failures to account for benefits in kind, drawings on director's loan accounts, capital gains and show underreporting of income from companies and rental payments. His dividend income was not, said Mr Clarke, what 'one might expect for a businessman claiming to be as successful as he does.' He added: 'He declared dividends of approximately PS55,000 in 2011-12, PS28,000 in 2012-13, PS9,000 in 2013-14, and PS147 in 2014-15 with PS297 taxable bank interest. i.e. his total taxable income declared for the tax year ending April 2015 was ---- PS444. The return for the year to 2016 showed only PS10,000 taxable income for the year. These were the very years when he and his staff were involved in banking millions of pounds of cash.' The Directors Loan Account with Stunt and Co was overdrawn in 2015 but no benefit in kind has been referred to in any tax return, said Mr Clarke. He added: 'In 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 PS543,385.67 was paid by Fowler Oldfield directly to Stunt, again this is not reflected in any declarations made by Stunt to HMRC. James STUNT, as the Director, signed and submitted accounts to Companies House, in respect of Stunt & Co, declaring that during the period of the 24th November 2014 to the 30th March 2016, Stunt & Co recorded their turnover as being PS43,538,406, resulting in a loss of some PS842,255, with no salaries or wages being paid to anyone, including James Stunt, with Stunt & Co recording assets as being worth PS4,944,784, having sold assets to the value of PS373,169. The assets were sold to James Stunt.' Stunt, 40, the socialite and former husband of heiress Petra Ecclestone, is one of eight defendants charged with money laundering involving depositing cash in the account of Bradford gold dealer Fowler Oldfield. Prosecutors say the cash was brought into business addresses owned or managed by the defendants between January 2014 and September 2016. Fowler Oldfield's accountant, Australian national Heidi Buckler, 45, knew of the large amounts of cash being delivered to their premises, as well as Stunt's firm, Stunt & Co in London, and also kept track of gold being exported to Dubai, the prosecution alleged. Prosecutor Nicholas Clarke QC told Leeds Cloth Hall Court that Buckler had changed invoices relating to the purchase of gold by one man Arjun Babber. Mr Babber emailed Ms Buckler saying: '...it shows 1 bar for both invoices can we make the invoices for a reasonable amount please'. Mr Clarke said Buckler replied: 'Sorry, no problems. I realised as soon as I had sent that I had forgotten to change the qty.' She sent a further email asking: 'Does it matter if there are Gold bars and some is Grain? So I can get the weight to align with the cost?' Mr Clarke said that Buckler subsequently altered two invoices, but he added: 'There was no explanation why one 1kg gold bar was valued at PS30,000 on one invoice and the same quantity valued at PS50,000 on another. These figures were all just made up to provide cover invoices that were designed to hide what was truly occurring.' Mr Clarke told the court that text messages recovered from Heidi Buckler's phone showed that she and fellow defendant and Fowler Oldfield director Daniel Rawson were sceptical about James Stunt's means. On November 29, 2015, he drew her attention to a Daily Mail article which questioned the source of Stunt's wealth. On June 24, 2016, Rawson texted her asking if she had seen Stunt's office in Mayfair, adding she wouldn't have been impressed since she knew 'it's all bulls***'. The sheer scale of the amounts of cash being delivered to Fowler Oldfield was illustrated by records relating to another of the defendants, Haroon Rashid, the court heard. Rashid, 51, was described as a director of Rashid Jewellers Ltd, a company listed at his Bradford home address, but which had no shop, workshop, or commercial premises, said Mr Clarke. Mr Clarke said CCTV footage captured Rashid making a variety of cash deliveries in carrier bags, shopping bags, a rucksack and a padlocked holdall. In one five-hour period on September 7, 2016, he delivered a total of almost PS1.2m (PS1,195,015) at the Fowler Oldfield office, said the prosecutor. Five defendants from Fowler Oldfield - Greg Frankel, Daniel Rawson, Paul Miller, Heidi Buckler and Haroon 'Harry' Rashid - all say the prosecution cannot prove that any of the cash was criminal property. The other defendants - Stunt, Alexander Tulloch and Francesca Sota - say they 'don't know whether it was', Mr Clarke has said. Buckler, 45, Frankel, 44, Miller, 45, Rashid, 51, Rawson, 45, Sota, 34, Stunt, 40 and Tulloch, 41, all deny money laundering. Stunt and Sota also deny forgery. Stunt married Ms Ecclestone, daughter of F1 tycoon Bernie Ecclestone, in Italy in 2011. They had three children together but divorced in 2017. Today's proceedings were paused when the jury were each given 1kg silver bars which had been covered with gilt to make them appear to be gold, which is 50 times more valuable. The judge and jury were also handed a genuine 1kg silver bar for comparison as two ushers carried the precious metal into the court on plastic trays. The fake gold bars were among 145 found in the safe of London company Pure 9s, said to be implicated in the money-laundering scheme, when police raided the premises. One genuine gold bar was also discovered. Mr Clarke said: 'The disguising of these bars is a remarkable feature of this case. To the untrained eye such gold plated bars might pass muster and so get through any cursory examination undetected for the relatively low value bars they are. ' He added that an 'anti-money laundering guide' bearing Greg Frankel's fingerprints was also found in the safe. Mr Clarke said that Stunt was owner, sole director and controlling mind of Stunt & Co Limited. 'He advertised himself as the Chairman and CEO of the business although others carried out his instructions and were given day to day management responsibilities.' He said the prosecution case was: That he knew what was happening at his offices, that he was aware of the amount of cash being delivered, both there and at other sites. 'He knew that cash was being counted by his Personal Assistant, Francesca Sota, and security staff in a separate room and he actively encouraged and directed them to cooperate in the receipt, counting and onward transmission of very significant amounts of cash.' He said the company Stunt & Co Limited was incorporated on 24th November 2014, but has not registered as an employer. Between October 29 2015 and August 2, 2016, it was claimed that just over PS28m in cash was collected at Stunt & Co's Mayfair office, and was credited to the Fowler Oldfield bank account. Mr Clarke added: 'The PS266 million cash and unknown deposits paid into and transferred through the bank account of Fowler Oldfield have been traced through by way of transfers to bank accounts held by a number of other companies, including PS46.7 million that was paid into the bank accounts of James Stunt and of Stunt & Co.' He added: 'Given the amounts involved and the lack of any scrutiny of the sources of the cash, it is the Crown's case that anyone involved in that process must have known or at the very least suspected that it was criminal in origin. 'The circumstances have all the hallmarks of a classic money laundering operation. It would undoubtedly have taken up a significant amount of time and resources and occupied a number of members of staff to accomplish the task of counting, recording and transhipping the volume of cash being received. 'It has been suggested by the defence that the facility was provided as agents for Fowler Oldfield without question or suspicion which we suggest is ridiculous and can be rejected by you.'",
    "533dfef187736b284deb2d8a9e759ac61abdb6458c9723cd33119bd2": "Shameless stockpilers have been showing off their 'towers' of NHS lateral flow packs after a rush for free swabs when it was revealed each test will cost between PS3 and PS5 each from April 1.  The Government website ran out last night with packs still unavailable online and via the 119 phone line this morning after Boris Johnson said they would be phased out in six weeks. People who opt to keep testing face spending PS20 to PS25 for a box of seven -- around PS3 to PS5 per test, MailOnline understands. Yesterday the Government already started secretly rationing, limiting orders to one pack in 72 hours rather than every 24 hours. And extraordinary pictures show the lengths that some Britons have gone to stockpile packs, proudly sharing pictures of mounds of tests that are costing the taxpayer PS2billion per month.   One person, who has stockpiled more than 25 packs, tweeted: 'When the Government wants to start charging for lateral flow tests. I've come fully prepared so I don't run out of covid tests'.  English dramatist and academic Dan Rebellato tweeted a picture of his own 'absurd tower' of tests in his office. He said: 'Both of us working in education, we test very regularly - to protect ourselves and our students. I knew they'd scrap the free testing so have been ordering test packs whenever I remember'. Some have even suggested they could choose to sell them online from April - while people in Wales and Scotland, where tests are expected to remain free, are offering to stockpile them there and post them to friends in England.   One person tweeted: 'If people order a load of free lateral flow tests now, then once it's April 1st they can sell them cheaper than the government, at least the money won't be going to them'.  Another wrote: 'Gonna start stocking up on lateral flow tests to take back to my family asap. very glad testing and isolation rules are staying the same in Wales at the moment'. Dr Leyla Hannbeck, Chief Executive of the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, told MailOnline that her members had noticed a growing trend of hoarding in the past 24 hours. She said: 'We raised concerns around Christmas time about supply not meeting the demand following change in government guidelines. Once again pharmacies find themselves in a situation where we are not communicated with prior to an announcement and need to deal with the increased demand'.  Over-80s and the most vulnerable will still be offered free Covid tests after they are scrapped nationwide, it was claimed today. Boris Johnson will unveil his 'living with Covid' strategy later today, with the Prime Minister expected to lay out a timetable for axing public access to lateral flow and PCR swabs. The regime -- thought to cost taxpayers around PS2billion a month -- could start to be wound down within weeks. But after wrangling between Sajid Javid's Department of Health and Rishi Sunak's Treasury, free testing is likely to be kept in place for at-risk groups. As well as the over-80s, Whitehall sources say free tests may still be made available to NHS staff, hospital patients and care home residents. No10's business minister Paul Scully today said the Government 'cannot continue forevermore spending PS2billion a month on tests'. He said: 'There's a lot of other backlogs in the NHS, other illnesses in the NHS, that that money could otherwise go for.' But Labour, the unions and medical experts argue it is simply too early to consider scrapping Covid curbs.   Hours after it was revealed that free LFTs will be phased out in England, a rush of orders led to them running out online. One person tweeted: 'I'm unable to get any lateral flow tests delivered to my home. My local pharmacy doesn't have any available for me to collect. I have no tests left. I work with the most vulnerable people in society. What do I do now if I have the mildest symptoms?'  Another critic said: 'Why if you can get free lateral flow tests until April have I just wasted time trying to order some to be told you have no slots ! It's ridiculous'.   As part of his 'living with Covid' blueprint, the Prime Minister announced last night he will scrap 'free' lateral flow tests within weeks. Britons can currently pick up the tests in pharmacies or order them through the Government's website at no cost. But the scheme costs No10 PS2billion per month.     Previously people worrying they had Covid were able to put an order in every 24 hours for a set. But now the Government portal says they can only be ordered once every three days.  Mathematical biologist Dr Kit Yates wrote online: 'It's started. You used to be able to order a pack of lateral flow tests every 24 hours. That has now gone up to every 72 hours.' Another added: 'Looks like the Lateral Flow Tests system has already changed ahead of PM's announcements today.' A Londoner said: 'I've been ordering a pack every 24 hours (ish) for the last week to stock up in light of the rumours of there being a charge. 'I want to be able to test before seeing anyone vulnerable. I'm sure it was still 24 hours earlier this morning.' Over-80s and the most vulnerable will still be offered free Covid tests after they are scrapped nationwide, it was claimed today. Boris Johnson unveiled his 'living with Covid' strategy yesterday. He said England would become one of the first countries in the world to emerge 'from the teeth of the pandemic', adding: 'After two of the darkest, grimmest years in our peacetime history, I believe this is a moment of pride for our nation and a source of hope for all that we can achieve in the years to come. 'The sun is shining but we're keeping our umbrella.' Confirmation that all Covid restrictions will end was cheered by Tory MPs, with even some of the PM's critics praising the move. Former Cabinet minister David Davis said the announcement 'could well be the beginning of the end - the end of daily curbs on our personal freedoms'. But Mr Johnson refused to offer any guarantees that lockdowns could be avoided in the future if a serious new variant emerged, saying only that vaccines and medication would form the 'first line of defence'. The biggest single change will see an end to disruptive self-isolation rules, with the PM saying it was time to start 'protecting ourselves without losing our liberties'. As part of his long-awaited strategy for 'living with Covid', Mr Johnson said free universal testing will be scrapped in April. He told MPs that it was time to 'move from government restrictions to personal responsibility'. Until the end of March, anyone who receives a positive Covid test will still be advised to stay at home for at least five days - but they will no longer be obliged to do it under the law. Routine contact tracing will end on Thursday, as will the PS500 self-isolation payments and the legal obligation for individuals to tell their employers about their requirement to isolate. Changes to statutory sick pay and employment support allowances will end on March 24. It means people will have to wait for four days before they can claim statutory sick pay, rather than straight away as at present. Free universal testing - which costs PS16 billion a year - will be massively scaled back from April 1 and will instead be focused on the most vulnerable. Free symptomatic testing for social care staff will continue. And although fewer tests will be taking place, ministers will keep labs in readiness to boost their capacity if cases start to rise. The Government expects a market for lateral flow devices to develop once boxes are no longer available free on the NHS, with individual tests expected to cost a few pounds.  It is believed they will be much cheaper than the tests people have had to pay for before going on holiday. To prevent people stockpiling them before April 1, individuals will be able to order a box of tests on the NHS only every three days instead of one every 24 hours. CBI policy director Matthew Fell welcomed the plan as a 'significant step towards normality returning' and said it could prove to be a 'springboard for confidence, providing firms the certainty they need to invest and grow'. But he said business would need further guidance on issues such as sick pay and employer liability to avoid a 'legal vacuum'. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the decision to end day-one sick pay would create 'needless hardship and take a sledgehammer to public health'. Labour opposed the end of free testing, with Sir Keir Starmer saying it was like 'taking off your best defender' during a close football match. How much do Covid tests REALLY cost? UK gears up for PS3 swabs from April 1 - but lateral flows can be three times cheaper in French supermarkets... and the kits themselves can cost just PENNIES to make  Britons will face paying PS3 per lateral flow test from April, despite French supermarkets offering them for three-times cheaper.  As part of his 'living with Covid' blueprint, the Prime Minister announced he will scrap 'free' lateral flow tests within weeks. Britons can currently pick up the tests in pharmacies or order them through the Government's website at no cost. But the scheme costs No10 PS2billion per month.  People who opt to keep testing face spending PS20 for a box of seven -- around PS3 per test, MailOnline understands.  But in France, people can pick up tests at a third of the price, for as little as PS1, while in Germany they can cost just PS1.80 and Spain's Government has capped them at roughly PS2.45.  However, the tests - which experts say can cost just pennies to make - are not as cheap everywhere, with Americans paying $10 (PS7.35). The Government said testing has been a 'crucial' part of its Covid response and more than 2billion kits have been dished out since 2020. But lateral flow and PCR tests will no longer be available to the general public for free. However, at-risk groups and social care staff will be able to take a test for free if they have symptoms. No10 said with the less severe Omicron being dominant and high levels of immunity across the country, 'the value for taxpayers' money is now less clear'.   Britons can currently buy the tests for PS12.99 at some retailers. But in France, the tests are easily accessible for EUR3 (PS2.50), but can be bought for as little as EUR1.24 (PS1) at retailer E.Leclerc. People in Germany can pay just EUR2.20 (PS1.80) per test at Lidl when buying a multipack of five tests, according to Spanish newspaper El Pais. Meanwhile, the Spanish Government brought in a price cap of EUR2.94 (PS2.45) per test. The European countries also offer free tests.  The exact cost of making the test varies, but some researchers say it is just five pence. But Mologic, one of the largest British testmakers, said the tests can cost $2 (PS1.47) to make. Dr Alexander Edwards, an associate professor in biomedical technology at Reading University, told MailOnline: 'Lateral flow tests are really cheap to manufacture, what costs is making high quality tests, and following all the regulatory requirements.  'So there is no reason why tests should cost more in UK than elsewhere in Europe, but tests can vary in quality, so it's possible that the really cheap products are less reliable.  'Remember also that the UK hasn't been an attractive market for suppliers because the free government tests make it unpredictable if or when you can ever sell any here.  'So it may take a while for things to even out. As practical advice, I'd suggest to people there really is no need to test all the time- save tests for when they are really important.' Professor Lawrence Young, a microbiologist from the University of Warwick, told MailOnline removing access to free tests 'will mean that we won't know who is infected and how the virus is spreading'.  He added: 'For those on low incomes who may be less inclined to test because of difficulties with being supported to self-isolate, this will mean ignoring symptoms with the inevitable consequence of spreading infection - including to those who are more vulnerable.' Ministers have never confirmed the exact details of their deals to buy lateral flow tests from manufacturers such as Innova. But last winter it was revealed that No10 had paid around PS800million in return for roughly 380million swabs from the California-based firm. That suggests the Government was paying in the region of PS2.10 per test but slightly more expensive estimates have also been touted. It comes as the UK's online portal to apply for seven lateral flow tests was quietly changed this morning to restrict how many could be ordered. Previously people worrying they had Covid were able to put an order in every 24 hours for a set. But now the Government portal says they can only be ordered once every three days. There were no announcements about this change but it was implemented ahead of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's expected announcement that all restrictions will be lifted.",
    "1c62ec19f2182d062d777168ba8cd68729f930c8c6594dc5841b9fca": "Passengers today told MailOnline of their frustration after a Virgin Atlantic flight to New York was forced to turn back to London Heathrow just 40 minutes in after the co-pilot admitted he hadn't passed his last flying test. The plane was over Ireland when the captain was told that the first officer had not completed his training. The Airbus A330 was ordered to return to Heathrow and passengers were told it was due to an 'administrative error'. Those on board landed in the US two hours and 40 minutes later than planned after the jet - which can carry nearly 300 passengers - was forced to wait on the runway at Heathrow while a qualified replacement was found. But all the passengers missed out on compensation - which is only payable for routes over 3,500km (Heathrow to JFK is 5,540km, or 3,440 miles) if you arrive four hours late at your destination and the airline is responsible.  Travellers told MailOnline that they only found out today about the issue with the co-pilot. Virgin assured them at the time that safety was not compromised, with both pilots fully licensed and qualified to operate the aircraft. The co-pilot needed a 'final assessment flight' with a training captain to be able to fly in line with Virgin Atlantic policy. His role as first officer meant he was responsible for maintaining the safety of the flight.  As a qualified pilot, first officers are also meant to support the captain with communicating with air traffic control and flying the plane. While the pairing of pilots was not in breach of any aviation or safety regulations, it did not comply with Virgin Atlantic's internal training protocols, which is why the flight was turned back.  Julie and Marc Vincent from Bournemouth were on board the flight and told MailOnline how staff blamed the situation on a clerical error. Mrs Vincent said: 'We'd just cleared the west coast of Ireland when the captain announced 'you may have noticed that we have conducted a 180 degree turn' before telling us that we were returning to Heathrow due to an 'administration error' and that they needed to get some paperwork signed off legally to be able to continue our journey.  'We landed back at Heathrow and were naturally concerned as you would expect that a large, long-established company such as Virgin needed to get their paperwork in order.  'I was also upset at losing holiday time as my husband and I were only in New York for three nights. We asked what was going on numerous times and all we were told was that it wasn't legal for us to be in the air and that we needed to return so an engineer could deem us fit to fly. They said it was a problem with paperwork that needed attention from ground staff. 'Panic did set in onboard particularly when upon landing people jumped out of their seats and started to pace up and down wanting more information. At least three people in high vis vests entered the cockpit for an amount of time before curtains were drawn to hide our view.  'We were kept on the plane and offered plastic cups of water while we waited for an update. One of the cabin crew very loudly communicated from one end to the other to say that two ovens were not working. 'The decision was taken and announced to us that the airline was going to feed us our in-flight meal on the ground. They started to serve first class passengers with just one trolley, which took a long time, but before we could be served, the plane took off again. 'If they had continued to feed us all as promised, we would have been outside of the four-hour delay compensation window and Virgin would have had to pay greater compensation to each passenger. Only this morning did I realise that the hold-up was due to the first officer not having completed his training. Incredible.' Another passenger, Mary Ingram, added: 'We had all settled down, boots off, halfway into our first film, with the smell of dinner floating through the cabin when an announcement was made by the pilot saying, 'Some of you have noticed from the flight tracker map that we have made a 180 degree turn and are returning to Heathrow.  Don't be alarmed, but we are having to return to Heathrow due to an administrative error.'  'The passengers behaved very calmly with no overt frustration or anger. It was unknown what the real cause of the return to Heathrow was, because clearly Virgin would not want to incur the loss of a returned, and therefore delayed, flight due to a paperwork administrative error. 'There was a certain amount of concern that something may have been wrong with the plane, so on landing we were all relieved when that went smoothly. It didn't help that the pilot or co-pilot told us to note our nearest exit in the pre-landing announcement. 'We were not allowed off the plane while we sat on the Tarmac for what was about another half an hour for re-fuelling, and what I now know replacement of the co-pilot.' And a source told The Sun: 'You could have cut the tension in the cockpit with a knife. The plane got as far as Ireland and then they found out the first officer was still in training. 'The skipper had no choice but to go back to Heathrow and find a more experienced member of the crew. It was embarrassing for everyone and the passengers were furious.'  A Virgin Atlantic spokesman told MailOnline: 'Due to a rostering error, flight VS3 from London Heathrow to New York-JFK returned to Heathrow on Monday, May 2 shortly after take-off. 'The qualified first officer, who was flying alongside an experienced captain, was replaced with a new pilot to ensure full compliance with Virgin Atlantic's training protocols, which exceed industry standards. 'We apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers who arrived two hours, 40 minutes later than scheduled as a result of the crew change.'  Sources told MailOnline that the captain on the aircraft had been with Virgin Atlantic for 17 years and had completed thousands of hours of flight time. Low-cost European airline Wizz Air saw a more than 500 per cent increase in the number of passengers carried in April as the recovery in the travel sector picked up pace. The Hungarian airline, which is listed in London, said it carried 3.6million passengers last month, up 542 per cent on the 564,634 who flew with the group a year ago when the coronavirus pandemic and restrictions hammered demand. Wizz Air recently bought extra slots at Luton Airport from Vueling, boosting services on existing routes to Romania and Poland and adding another 167,000 seats. It said it now has more than 5.6 million seats available on flights for the summer season, with new routes across its network from Italy, the UK, Romania, Poland, Lithuania and Bosnia and Hercegovina to destinations across Europe. New routes offer destinations in Greece, Germany, Denmark and Croatia. The first officer joined in 2017 and had been trained, fully licensed and fully type-rated in accordance with UK regulations, but was still pending a 'final assessment' flight with Virgin Atlantic. The flight took off from Heathrow at 9.41am on Monday, before the turnback was initiated at 10.19am, and it then landed back at Heathrow at 11.12am.  Sources added that Virgin Atlantic has since reviewed its internal processes and updated them in an effort to avoid the same thing happening again. A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said: 'Virgin Atlantic have made us aware of the incident. Both pilots were suitably licensed and qualified to undertake the flight.'  To be qualified to fly the aircraft, an individual must hold an aircraft type rating and a valid licence proficiency check, which the first officer held.  With the type rating and licence proficiency check, a pilot can legally and safely operate the aircraft in any geographical area worldwide.  Virgin Atlantic devises a line training programme, and it trains these procedures in the first eight flights. The 'final assessment flight' is a company requirement from Virgin Atlantic to ensure that the employee operates using its specific methodology.  The staff member in question was recommended as ready for his final assessment flight on their previous flight, having completed 12 recent flights on the A330 after his complete simulator and class room training programme. He was therefore deemed as safe and competent to operate the flight, but the decision for the aircraft to return to Heathrow was made based on Virgin's internal compliance requirements.  ** Do YOU know the rookie pilot?

    "754c92294e431600eae004e3104a2a4d78ef2a2fa085a556c6877a91": "The killer mother of Baby P could be set free within weeks after a judge refused the Dominic Raab's attempt to block her release.  The move sparked a furious row, with the Justice Secretary raging against the decision to release Tracey Connelly, saying it showed why the parole board 'needs a fundamental overhaul'.   Connelly, now 40, was jailed for a minimum of five years in 2009, for causing or allowing the death of her tortured 17-month-old son Peter in a horrific case that shocked the nation. She was released in 2013 but was recalled to prison in 2015 for selling naked photos of herself and breaching her licence conditions by 'developing intimate personal relationships' online. In March the Parole Board announced she had been cleared for release due to a low risk of reoffending. But within hours Mr Raab vowed to block the move, describing the notorious case as 'harrowing'. The Justice Secretary can apply to have a verdict reconsidered if he believes 'the correct process was not followed' or 'the decision was irrational or unreasonable'. Nevertheless, the Parole Board says it considers cases carefully so it would be unusual for a decision to change.  Responding today to the news his appeal had failed, Mr Raab said Connelly's actions were 'pure evil' and added: 'The decision to release her demonstrates why the parole board needs a fundamental overhaul - including a ministerial check for the most serious offenders - so that it serves and protects the public.'  The evil mother will be subject to 20 licence conditions, including having to wear an electronic tag and disclose all her relationships. She will also have her Internet use monitored and be forced to obey a curfew.  March 1, 2006: Peter Connelly (Baby P) is born August 3, 2007: 17-month-old Baby P is found dead in cot November 11, 2008: Peter's mother, Tracey Connelly, boyfriend Steven Barker and brother Jason Owen are convicted of causing his death November 13, 2008: Ed Balls orders an inquiry into the role of the council, health authority and police December 1, 2008: An independent review declares Haringey's child protection services 'inadequate' December 8, 2008: Haringey Children's Services boss Sharon Shoesmith is sacked with immediate effect May 22, 2009: Connelly is jailed indefinitely, Barker gets a life term and Owen is given an indeterminate sentence for public protection October 7, 2009: Shoesmith launches a High Court case against Balls to seek compensation for her dismissal September 15, 2010: Shoesmith tells MPs she is sorry about what happened but refuses to accept any blame, saying she had no involvement in the care of Baby P May 27, 2011: The Court of Appeal rules in favour of Shoesmith, saying dismissal was 'tainted by unfairness' October 8, 2013: Connelly is recommended for release  February 14, 2015: Connelly is back behind bars after sending nude pictures to male fans December 29, 2015: The Parole Board rejects Connelly's first bid for freedom November 28, 2017: It rejects Connelly's second bid for freedom  January 6, 2019: The Parole Board rejects Connelly's third bid for freedom March 30, 2022: Connelly is recommended for release again  April 2022: Dominic Raab appeals the decision.  May 5: Parole Board rejects his appeal.  Known publicly as Baby P, Peter had suffered more than 50 injuries despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police officers and health professionals over eight months. Connelly's lover Steven Barker was jailed in 2009 for a minimum of 32 years for torturing the 17-month-old to death while his brother, Jason Owen, received a six year jail sentence for allowing the toddler to die.  A series of reviews identified missed opportunities for officials to save the toddler's life had they reacted properly to warning signs. In March the Parole Board decided she was suitable for release, having rejected three previous bids. Today, the Parole Board announced the application had been rejected and the original decision upheld. A spokesman said in a statement: 'Following the reconsideration application from the Secretary of State, a judge has ruled that the decision made by independent Parole Board members to release was not irrational, as stated in the reconsideration application, and the original decision is upheld.' The reconsideration mechanism, introduced in July 2019, allows the Justice Secretary and the prisoner to challenge the board's decision within 21 days if they believe them to be 'procedurally unfair' or 'irrational'. Victims and members of the public can also make a request via the minister. But the threshold is high and is the same as is required when seeking a judicial review in court. The provisions also make clear that 'being unhappy' with the decision is not grounds for reconsideration. Mr Raab intervened on the grounds that the decision to free Connelly was 'irrational', arguing it had failed to take proper account of some information surrounding the case and did not provide sufficient reasons for its conclusion. The Parole Board added: 'In summary, the judge has concluded that the panel did take into consideration all evidence mentioned by the application and made rational conclusions.'  Connelly will be subject to restrictions on her movements, activities and who she contacts, and faces 20 extra licence conditions. They include living at a specified address, being supervised by probation, wearing an electronic tag, adhering to a curfew and having to disclose her relationships. Who has the power to release criminals from prison? The 246 members of the Parole Board of England and Wales make risk assessments and decisions on whether prisoners can be safely released or moved to an open jail.  What power does Dominic Raab have and can the Parole Board decision be overturned? While the initial decision to release prisoners is made by the Parole Board, the Justice Secretary can apply to have a verdict reconsidered if he believes 'the correct process was not followed' or 'the decision was irrational or unreasonable'.  Nevertheless, the Parole Board says it considers cases carefully so it would be unusual for a decision to change.  If a parole decision is not challenged within 21 calendar days it becomes final and the prisoner must be released. How does he want to reform the system?  The plans could see ministers override the Parole Board when it comes to the release of dangerous criminals from jail, with an aim to focus on protecting the public rather than the rights of offenders.  This could include cases involving murder, rape, terrorism and causing or allowing the death of a child. Similarly, where the Parole Board cannot confidently say the prisoner is safe to leave prison, they will refer the decision to the Justice Secretary. While victims will not have a definitive say in the decision to release, they will be given the chance to attend hearings as an observer and ask questions, while the board will be required to take their submissions into account.  Currently, victims are limited to a statement shared with the board explaining how the crime impacted on their life. Her use of the internet and a phone will be monitored, and she has been told she cannot go to certain places to 'avoid contact with victims and to protect children'.   Peter and three other children were sharing the four-bedroom house with their mother, her boyfriend and his brother when he died. A series of reviews identified missed opportunities for officials to save the toddler's life had they reacted properly to warning signs.  Three of the children, including Peter, were on Haringey's Child Protection Register because of fears they were being neglected. Connelly, who covered up the abuse of her son, was jailed indefinitely in 2009 for a minimum of five years after admitting causing or allowing the death of her son Peter. She was then freed on licence in 2013 but later recalled to prison in 2015 after it was found she had sent indecent images of herself to people obsessed with her notoriety.   The Parole Board considered her case for a third time in November 2019, following previous reviews in 2015 and 2017, and refused to either release her or move her to an open prison.  In 2019, the convict launched a bid to be freed from prison so she could try to spend Christmas with her lover. She became besotted with a 37-year-old insurance salesman named Paul and told fellow prisoners she want to move in with him in Reading. The abuser said she believed she was ready to leave prison a 'changed woman'.  Connelly insisted her relationship was genuine because she had known him for many years.  Mr Raab has insisted the case for reform of the parole system is 'clear and made out'.  Offenders who are subject to life sentences, indeterminate sentences for public protection, extended sentences and certain recall cases are all subject to the parole process, meaning their release must be directed by the Parole Board. The proposed reforms could see ministers override the Parole Board when it comes to the release of dangerous criminals from jail, with an aim to focus on protecting the public rather than the rights of offenders. This could include cases involving murder, rape, terrorism and causing or allowing the death of a child. Victims are also expected to be given the right to attend parole hearings in full for the first time, in a nod to the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto. Tracey Connelly, who covered up the abuse of her son Baby Peter, was living with Steven Barker and Jason Owen when little Peter died. Barker was a sadistic neo-Nazi who raped a two-year-old girl, tortured his own grandmother and is suspected of sex attacks on other children. Their 'lodger' and his brother Owen was a crack cocaine addict and convicted arsonist who was accused of raping a girl of 11. The full horror of what they put Peter through only emerged after he was found dead in his cot, his emaciated body covered with 22 separate injuries. At the time of his death, Peter and three other children were sharing a four-bedroom house with Connelly, her boyfriend Barker, his paedophile brother Owen and his four children, plus Owen's 15-year-old girlfriend. Three of the children - including Peter - were on Haringey's Child Protection Register because of fears they were being neglected. Social workers, health visitors and doctors saw the family 60 times before 17-month-old Peter died from his horrific injuries, which included a snapped spine and eight broken ribs. The Parole Board will now be required to take into account submissions made by victims and they will be allowed to ask questions. The new rules could also see more police, and other people with 'enforcement experience', recruited to sit on Parole Board decision panels. Mr Raab said it was 'striking' that as of last year only 5% of all Parole Board panel members come from a law enforcement background, telling MPs he believed this was a 'significant deficit'. Setting out his review of the parole system earlier this year, Mr Raab said: 'Our reforms will ensure that those offenders who present the highest risk to public safety are reviewed more rigorously with additional ministerial oversight.  'Protecting the public is the Government's top priority. The proposals in this review will enforce public safety.' He added: 'Following the review we have conducted and published today, I believe the case for reform is clear and made out.'  Mr Raab also said a ministerial check would be introduced in cases which involve 'those who have committed the most serious crimes'. He said: 'I believe the focus in this critical decision-making has become adrift from its original moorings. So this Government will anchor Parole Board decision-making back to the cardinal principle of public protection. 'When it comes to assessing the risk to victims and public safety, we will introduce a precautionary principle to reinforce public confidence in the system and in cases which involve those who have committed the most serious crimes, we will introduce a ministerial check on release decisions exercised by the secretary of state for justice. 'The package of reforms published today will strengthen the focus on public protection at every stage.' Outlining his plans further, Mr Raab said: 'It is striking that as of last year only 5% of all Parole Board panel members come from a law enforcement background.' He added: 'But I do point to what I believe is a significant deficit. I believe it is wrong and that our reforms will ensure that those who we charge with making finely balanced assessments of future risk have greater first hand operational experience of protecting the public from serious offenders.  'So we will change this imbalance by mandating the Parole Board to recruit more members with operational or enforcement experience.'   Black cab rapist John Worboys The board faced widespread criticism over its handling of the case of the Black Cab rapist - a serial sex offender convicted in 2009 for attacks on 12 women. He was recommended for release in 2018, but just weeks later, the decision was overturned after it was challenged by two of his victims. Double child killer Colin Pitchfork  Last year the board allowed the release of Pitchfork, who raped and murdered two 15-year-old girls in the 1980s. However, he was recalled to jail less than three months later after he was caught 'approaching young women'. Christmas Day killer Steven Ling The farm worker was jailed for life in December 1998 after admitting murdering 29-year-old Joanne Tulip in Stamfordham, Northumberland on Christmas Day 1997.  The Parole Board recommended earlier this year that he be transferred to a lower security jail, however this was overruled by Justice Secretary Dominic Raab.   Catflap rapist Paul Robson  Robson was given two life sentences in August 2000 after he broke into a 23-year-old woman's house in Oxford through a cat flap and sexually assaulted her while holding a knife to her throat. He fled an open prison in Boston, Lincolnshire earlier this year and was on the loose for four days, which led to the MoJ insisting Mr Raab will have more control over the transfer of prisoners in the most high-risk cases. Double killer Paul O'Hara  O'Hara murdered new girlfriend Cherylee Shennan in 2014 two years after he was freed early from a life term for killing his ex Janine Waterworth, whose parents said their protests that he was still dangerous were ignored by the Parole Board.  Jailmate thugs Stephen Unwin and William McFall  Stephen Unwin and William McFall, were jailed for raping and murdering a young Vietnamese mother who they had tortured for four hours. They met while serving life for killing OAPs during burglaries. Each was paroled after only 13 years. Drug addict killer George Johnson   Long-term drug addict George Johnson killed a hotel worker in 1986 for just PS3. Freed in 2006, he battered to death an 89-year-old widow five years later to steal PS25 to feed his heroin and crack cocaine habit. The 'Devil's Child' Damien Hanson  Damien Hanson murdered a banker in 2004, three months after winning parole. He was seven years into a 12-year term for trying to kill a teenage boy. Known as 'the Devil's Child', he was freed despite a report saying he was a 91 per cent reoffending risk. Bodybuilding killer Douglas Vinter  Fitness fan Douglas Vinter knifed his wife Ann White to death after kidnapping her and holding her hostage in 2008. They had married soon after he was freed in 2005 - just ten years into a life sentence for murdering a workmate in a railway cabin. Pub landlord murderer Ian Simms  Last year the Parole Board freed murderer Ian Simms, despite his refusal to reveal the whereabouts of the remains of his victim. Clerk Helen McCourt, 22, disappeared on her way home in Merseyside in 1988. Her mother lost a legal bid to keep Simms behind bars but a new rule, known as Helen's Law, now makes it harder for killers to get parole if they refused to reveal where a victim's body is. Serial rapist Joseph McCann  Blundering probation staff missed a series of chances to recall McCann to jail before he attacked 11 victims. He was given 33 life terms and jailed for at least 30 years for kidnapping, raping and sexually assaulting women and children aged 11 to 71. McCann had been freed from prison by mistake two months before his two-week rampage fuelled by vodka and cocaine when he forced victims into his car at knifepoint.",
    "8188b6e2b7a4d2668f77ec9f96b6b3b4cbab5c867b62c40bf7a34181": "Boris Becker's girlfriend was seen visiting the disgraced tennis star in Wandsworth Prison today - after he called her and his 86-year-old mother from jail.   Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro was seen walking out of the notorious Victorian lock-up wearing a denim jacket, joggers and a cap while carrying a silver Puma holdall.  Becker, 54, has been allowed to make two telephone calls in jail, one to Lilian - who is in her forties - and one to his elderly mother, according to reports.  He is 'doing ok' behind bars and his mental health is good, his estranged wife has said, although she added the jail 'was not a five-star hotel'.  Prisoners at Wandsworth are allowed to make one call after arriving, but the sportsman was allowed an extra one as a 'celebrity bonus', a member of staff told Bild.  Becker's girlfriend Lilian is a political risk analyst, who started dating the three-time Wimbledon champion in the summer of 2020 after he split with his ex-wife Lilly in 2018 following nine years of marriage.  She has three degrees, including a masters in African studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, and speaks five languages, including German. Becker has been inside the tough London prison since Friday, when he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for hiding assets during bankruptcy proceedings.  It came as his ex wife Lilly Becker, 45, gave her first interview since his sentencing.   Lilly said she has not spoken to Becker since he was jailed but she is 'dying to see him'. 'Lillian has told me he is ok,' she added. 'He's fine. I mean, it's not a five-star hotel is it? He can be as good as he can be.' Lilian was born in the African island state of Sao Tome and Principe and is the daughter of Victor Monteiro, the republic's former Minister of Defence who ran for the presidency in 2014. She spent much of her youth in Rome where she attended a private school before studying at the University of La Sapienza, before coming to London to study at the School of Oriental and African Studies, where she earned her master's degree at the age of 25. After arriving in the capital she met father-of-four Boris Becker - who had been married twice before, to Lilly between 2009 and 2018, and Barbara Becker from 1993 to 2001.     Lilian and Becker were reported to have linked in June 2020, before they spent time together in London as well as being seen in Dubai back in January 2021 during the third UK lockdown. In the summer of 2021, the couple were seen kissing and enjoying the warm weather on a boat trip in Ibiza. This year, Lilian has been a constant presence by Becker's side while attending court hearings, in which he was initially accused and later found guilty of hiding PS2.5million worth of assets and loans to avoid paying his debts. Lilian was seen attending Southwark Court Court alongside Becker and even blew him a goodbye kiss after he was jailed for two and a half years and blasted by a judge for showing no remorse. Becker, 54, was declared bankrupt in June 2017, owing creditors almost PS50million over an unpaid loan of more than PS3million on his estate in Mallorca, Spain.  The BBC pundit transferred around PS390,000 from his business account to others, including those of his ex-wife Barbara Becker and estranged wife Sharlely 'Lilly' Becker. He also failed to declare his share in a PS1million property in his home town of Leimen, Germany, hid a bank loan of almost PS700,000 - worth PS1.1million with interest - and concealed 75,000 shares in a tech firm, valued at PS66,000. Becker - who got a two-year suspended sentence for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion worth PS1.4million in Germany in 2002 - was found guilty on April 8 of four Insolvency Act offences between June and October 2017. As he was led away, Becker was red-faced and appeared to struggle with his overnight bag. Lilian blew him a kiss before he disappeared out of the court to the cells below.  Becker had earlier arrived at court with Lilian, dressed smartly in a suit and wearing a Wimbledon tie as he walked up the steps and into the building while holding hands with her. He then entered the dock of the court, while his eldest son came into the courtroom carrying a large Puma-branded bag, which the tennis star had previously been seen carrying outside his home.  After Becker was sentenced, former British number one tennis player Andrew Castle said he felt sorry for Lilian.  Few sports stars have ever hit the height of Boris Becker's tennis careers - and none as young as the German ace. Born in Leimen, West Germany, in 1967, Becker, the son of an architect father and a Czech immigrant mother, was thrust into the world of tennis from a young age. His father founded a tennis centre in the town, where Becker honed his skills early on. By the age of 10, in 1977, he was a member of the junior team of the Baden Tennis Association. He went on to win the South German championship and the first German Youth Tennis Tournament.  After winning funding for training from the German Tennis Federation, he turned professional at 16 in 1984, winning the Tennis World Young Masters at the NEC in Birmingham in 1985, before claiming victory at Queens in June. Two weeks later, in July, aged 17, he entered Wimbledon as an unseeded player and took the tournament by storm, beating Kevin Curren by four sets in the final.  At just 17 years and 228 days old he became the youngest men's singles champion at SW19 - and immediately became a household name. The following year he defend his title, beating then world number one Ivan Lendl to secure back-to-back Wimbledon titles. He appeared in 77 finals and won 49 singles titles during his 16 years as a tennis pro. But by 1993, facing criticism over his marriage to wife Barbara and tax problems with the German government, had caused Becker to slide into a severe mid-career decline. In 1997, Becker lost to Sampras in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. After that match, he vowed that he would never play at Wimbledon again. However he returned one more time to the prestigious west London tennis club, in 1999, this time losing in the fourth round to Patrick Rafter. Off the court, his personal troubles continued. He had to pay PS2.4million after he fathered a daughter, named Anna, with a Russian model while married to wife Barbara. That incident took place after he crashed out of Wimbledon to Rafter in 1999 and decided to retire from the sport, aged 31. Becker, in his 2003 autobiography, Stay A Moment Longer, revealed how he 'cried my eyes out' and felt the need to go out for a few beers with friends. However his then wife Barbara, seven months' pregnant with their second son, wanted him to stay at their hotel with her.  'She couldn't and wouldn't understand that she suddenly wasn't first in my priorities,' said Becker.  'I said, 'Just once more with the lads, Barbara, just once more to say farewell and then it's only you'. That didn't work. We rowed for two whole hours. Suddenly she was in pain and decided to check into hospital.; Becker said he told his wife to call him if the baby was really on the way, then hit the town. By 11pm he was at the bar in Mayfair's Nobu and spotted Russian model Angela Ermakowa. The pair had sex on the staircase in the London outpost.  The following February his secretary handed him a fax in his Munich office. It read: 'Dear Herr Becker, We met in Nobu in London. The result of that meeting is now eight months old.'  He later split from his first wife Barbara Feltus, a divorce which is estimated to have cost him more than PS15million, as well as their home in Miami.  Becker found a new post-tennis purpose soon after, joining the BBC for its annual coverage of Wimbledon - to great success. But his personal problems continued. He had a short engagement to Alessandra Meyer-Wolden in 2008, before announcing that he and Dutch model Sharlely 'Lilly' Kerssenberg would marry in 2009. After nine years of marriage, and a child, Becker's fourth, the pair split in 2018.  A year earlier, Becker had been declared bankrupt in June 2017 over an unpaid loan of more than PS3million on his estate in Mallorca, Spain. His former business partner, Hans-Dieter Cleven, also claimed that the former tennis ace owed him more than PS30million - though the case that was rejected by a Swiss court.",
    "1d657fdd50628959c2ab992c4dcbafa3964702c01e674973a36c32f8": "The Bank of England today warned families to brace for a bleak Christmas with the cost-of-living crisis set to reach an agonising climax at the end of this year - and potentially drag the country into recession for the second time in barely three years. Governor Andrew Bailey laid out the storm clouds that are gathering over the UK, with CPI inflation now expected to peak at 10 per cent - the highest level since 1982 - in the last quarter when the energy cap soars again. In a brutal hit on families, GDP is projected to plunge by around 0.9 per cent over those three months - and will be in the red through 2023 as a whole, declining by 0.25 per cent.  The Bank suggested the country will avoid a technical recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of falling activity - but experts warned the risk is 'intensifying'. UK plc has barely clawed back the ground from the Covid-triggered downturn in 2020, which was the biggest in a century.  In a desperate bid to control rampant inflation, the Bank has pushed up interest rates once more despite the danger of choking what little growth is left. The latest 0.25 percentage point hike takes them to a 13-year high of 1 per cent and will add to the mortgage burden for many Britons already struggling to cope with the cost-of-living crisis. It is the fourth increase the Monetary Policy Committee has ordered since December.    The Bank admitted that the balance of risk on inflation is still that it could be even higher than anticipated, with the shock bigger than the oil crisis of the 1970s but lasting less time. At a press conference, Mr Bailey warned that the Ukraine war had 'sharply intensified' inflationary pressures. He said the 1.75 per cent squeeze on incomes this year would be the worst on record apart from 2011 and he 'recognised the hardship that this will cause for many in the UK'.  'The biggest driver is the real income shock which is coming from the change in the terms of trade, particularly from energy prices, and from some core goods and some food,' he said.  Boris Johnson - who is facing crucial local elections today - has admitted that Britain is in a 'tough patch' but said the country is in a 'much better position' to cope with rising inflation than it was in the 1980s or 1990s. The value of the pound slipped near two-year lows at 1.24 against the US dollar and 0.6 per cent to 1.178 against the euro after the Bank's gloomy views emerged.  Inflation has long been seen as one of the biggest threats to economies. In extreme examples, it has spiralled out of control and sparked panic. The German Weimar Republic effectively collapsed after the value of the mark went from around 90 marks to the US dollar in 1921 to 7,400 marks to the dollar in 1921. In Zimbabwe between 2008 and 2009 the monthly inflation rate was estimated to have reached a mind-boggling 79.6billion per cent. Although inflation has faded in the minds of Britons who have become used to ultra-low interest rates and stable prices, it caused chaos here in the 1970s. Deregulation of the mortgage market, the emergence of credit cards and an overheating economy drove the rate to an eye-watering 25 per cent in 1975. People would rush to buy goods with their wages after pay-day, as the costs were rising so quickly. Strikes erupted as there was pressure for pay packets to keep pace with prices. Unemployment rose as the economy tipped into recession, and the government had to pump up interest rates in a bid to bolster the pound and control the surge. That meant mortgage interest payments spiked into double digits. And as a result servicing the national debt became a serious problem.   The Bank's main remit is to control inflation, but there are doubts over how effective a rate cut can be when the pressures are largely global and the UK economy already appears to be slowing down dramatically. In a grim set of forecasts, it predicted growth will contract in the final three months of 2022 as the cost squeeze sees households rein in their spending. The UK is set to narrowly miss a technical recession, as defined by two quarters in a row of falling GDP, but the Bank expects very weak quarterly growth in 2023 and a contraction as a whole next year - with GDP down 0.25 per cent and unemployment picking up sharply as cost pressures hit hard. The prediction for growth in 2022 remains unchanged at 3.75 per cent, although the Bank also slashed its growth outlook for 2024 to 0.25 per cent from the 1 per cent it predicted in February. Sky-high inflation will see household disposable income plunge by 1.75 per cent this year - the second highest on record - while overall real income will tumble by an unprecedented 3.25 per cent this year and fall again in 2023 before beginning to recover, the Bank cautioned. Despite the stalling economy, three MPC members - Catherine Mann, Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders - backed a bigger rate rise to 1.25 per cent.  Allies of Rishi Sunak believe his insistence on holding back some of the boon from higher tax revenues in his Spring Statement has been vindicated by the dire Bank forecasts.  He will now be under massive pressure to come forward with more help for Britons unable to make ends meet.   However, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis insisted last night that there will be no more support announced before the Autumn Budget. Financial markets predict that interest rates will reach 2.5 per cent by the middle of next year as policymakers battle to contain inflation. But the Bank signalled they may not go as high as that because it could leave inflation below the 2 per cent target at the end of its forecast. The report makes for painful reading, with household income under severe pressure ahead of a predicted 40 per cent hike in the energy price cap in October. The headline CPI inflation rate reached 7 per cent in March, the highest since 1992, and is tracking higher as the Ukraine war and pandemic fallout drive up energy and food prices. Boris Johnson's former Downing Street Svengali has urged voters from across the political spectrum to unite to kick him out of office in a sensational election day attack.  Lambasting the Prime Minister as 'pointless', Vote Leave mastermind Dominic Cummings this afternoon urged Remains, Brexiteers and those on the  left and right of politics to join forces to deliver 'regime change'.   Mr Cummings, who was booted out in December 2020 after losing a power struggle with Mr Johnson's wife, accused the Conservatives of being 'politically, & organisationally rancid' in a Twitter tirade. He accused them of focusing too much on 'culture war' issues like trans rights at the expense of law and order and the economy. It came as Mr Johnson braces for a battering over Partygate today as voters go to the polls in local elections - with the outcome in key battlegrounds set to decide his fate. The PM has cast his own ballot in Westminster as Tories anxiously wait to assess the damage from the Downing Street scandal, with thousands of councillors being elected across the country. Using his favourite description of Mr Johnson as a 'wonky shopping trolley' on Twitter, Mr Cummings said: 'Vote Tory = more... taxes, regulation, sh*t bureaucracy, violent/sex crime, neglect of security/armed forces, A&E disasters / NHS neglect, chance of nuclear war ... while idiots babbling about trans & other sh*te get promoted all over SW1. 'Tories and their wider support in media/'think tanks' etc are so intellectually, politically, and organisationally rancid that a change of leader may well not change these dynamics, but there is NO chance of even discussing serious change unless the [wonky shopping trolley] is replaced. 'Only point of [wonky shopping trolley] as PM was to act as spokesman for the Vote Leave agenda while we pushed everything in a different direction. Once this was 99 per cent abandoned in 2020 the entire spectacle is pointless *for all except the [wonky shopping trolley] himself* who enjoys riding his bike at Chequers etc 'Unless you're someone like Nadine [Dorries, the Culture Secretary] or the Telegraph ('the real boss') or Zelensky's social media crew, it's irrational to prop up the (clown) show any more. 'Remain/brexit/left/right/political/official, all shd unite in removing pointless fkd'. He is not the only former high ranking Tory who advocated voting against the party today. Ex-minister Nick Boles, who quite Parliament in 2019, revealed today he had voted for Labour.   A dire set of results could be terminal for Mr Johnson, as MPs mull whether to launch a coup bit after he was fined for breaking lockdown rules.   The MPC said today: 'Consumer Price Index inflation is expected to rise further over the remainder of the year, to just over 9 per cent in 2022 Q2 and averaging slightly over 10 per cent at its peak in 2022 Q4. 'The majority of that further increase reflects higher household energy prices following the large rise in the Ofgem price cap in April and projected additional large increase in October. 'The price cap mechanism means that it takes some time for increases in wholesale gas and electricity prices, and their respective futures curves, to be reflected in retail energy prices. 'Given the operation of the price cap, consumer price inflation is likely to peak later in the United Kingdom than in many other economies, and may therefore fall back later. 'The expected rise in CPI inflation also reflects higher food, core goods and services prices.' Deputy governor Ben Broadbent said the UK economy is facing a shock on a bigger scale than that seen in the 1970s oil and energy crisis, though he said it is not set to last as long. Growth of 0.9 per cent was better than the Bank expected in the first three months of 2022, but it predicts the economy will flatline in the second quarter before dropping by nearly 1 per cent in the closing three months of 2022. While the rate of unemployment will ease back further to as low as 3.6 per cent, it will jump back up to 5.5 per cent within three years, according to the Bank. Now that rates have hit the 1 per cent threshold, the Bank also confirmed it will start drawing up plans for selling off some of its PS847 billion in Government bonds - built up as part of its quantitative easing programme launched in 2009 amid the financial crisis. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves accused ministers of 'shrugging their shoulders' about the looming hit to incomes.  'Rising interest rates and further troubling growth downgrades underline not only how the Tories are failing to tackle the cost of living crisis, but also how poorly they're managing our economy,' she said. 'This will seriously worry families across the country already dealing with soaring prices and bills. 'Not only are Ministers shrugging their shoulders at the spiralling cost of living crisis, they've made it worse by hitting working people and businesses with fifteen Tory tax rises that will further stifle our economic growth.' Ms Reeves repeated Labour's call for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to raise money for handouts. Suren Thiru, head of economics, at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said higher interest rates would only raise the risk of recession. 'The decision to raise interest rates will cause considerable alarm among households and businesses given the rapidly deteriorating economic outlook and mounting cost pressures many are facing,' he said. 'The Bank of England faces an unenviable trade-off between soaring inflation and a wilting economy. 'However, higher interest rates will do little to address the global headwinds and supply constraints driving this inflationary surge. 'It also raises the risk of recession by damaging confidence and intensifying the financial squeeze on businesses and consumers.' The Bank's announcement came after the Federal Reserve lifted its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point yesterday with US inflation running at a 40-year peak. Paul Johnson, director of the respected IFS think-tank, warned earlier of the impact on people's mortgages of raising interest rates. 'We are still at historically staggeringly low levels of interest rates,' he told Radio 4's Today programme. 'So you look at it that way and think one quarter of a percent, half a percent, still a very low level, that doesn't look very dramatic. 'On the other hand, of course, if you've got a mortgage and it goes up by half a percent or 1 per cent proportionally that's a very big increase. 'That could be doubling your mortgage interest payments over a period of time, so even small changes now, at least down the line once people certain fixed rates run through, could have really big effects on people who have got significant mortgages.' The parlous state of UK plc was underlined today with a survey showing confidence at companies in the UK's service sector, including retailers, hospitality and leisure industries, has hit the lowest level in 18 months. The closely-followed S&P Global/CIPS business activity index showed the sector is still growing, scoring 58.9 in April. But this was down from 62.6 in March, with anything above 50 as a sector in growth. Bosses warned that costs for goods hit a record high last month, with the cost of business and the impacts from the ongoing war in Ukraine slowing the speed of growth in the sector. On the final day of campaigning ahead of today's local elections, the Prime Minister vowed to 'support people in any way that we can' in the face of the cost of living crisis.  During a visit to Southampton, Mr Johnson said: 'The best future for the country is to get through the tough patch we have now, support people in any way that we can, but remember we are now seeing a lot of employment and people in high-wage, high-skilled jobs.' The PM also warned against imposing a windfall tax on big energy companies. He said a tax would 'stop investment' in urgently needed new solutions and green energy for the country to build up its own energy supplies. 'The problem we have is that... this is an incredible country, incredible economy, fifth biggest in the world, but we're mainlining energy from France,' he said. 'It's insane. We haven't invested enough in our own domestic energy and we need these big energy companies to step up to the plate and put their money into sustainable solutions. That is a much better solution than clobbering them and stopping them from making that investment.' The Government has been criticised for failing to do more to help ease the cost of living crisis - and pressing ahead with deeply unpopular tax rises including the hike in national insurance. But while inflation is at a 30-year high of seven per cent and could even hit 10 per cent later this year, unemployment is just 3.8 per cent. It has not been lower since 1974, and was above 10 per cent for much of the 1980s and early 1990s. A former member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee claimed yesterday that the UK economy is already in recesssion and interest rates should be slashed. Professor David Blanchflower, who sat on the MPC between 2006 and 2009, insisted it would be an 'error' for interest rates to be raised further. In response to soaring inflation, the Bank has raised interest rates three times in a row since December from 0.1 per cent to 0.75 per cent. And there is a widespread expectation that the MPC will raise rates once again tomorrow. But Prof Blanchflower pushed back at the belief that further rates rises were needed from Threadneedle Street to deal with inflation, as he predicted the UK economy would begin to 'tank'. 'The reality is it looks like the US and the UK are actually already in recession,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'The European Central Bank, faced with much the same circumstances, actually is not raising rates. 'So there is really a question about whether you should raise rates - even though there's inflation present - when it looks like the economy is either headed to, or in the UK case, looks already to be in recession.'  How high will interest rates go? Bank of England hikes base rate to 1% in battle against rampant inflation - but three MPC members called for a bigger 0.5% rise  The Bank of England hiked the base rate to its highest level for 13 years today, with a 0.25 per cent rise to 1 per cent. The rate rise to battle surging inflation - now expected to average 10 per cent over autumn - should benefit savers but will hit mortgage borrowers and businesses, who face higher borrowing costs. Led by Governor Andrew Bailey, the Monetary Policy Committee increased the key UK interest rate from 0.75 per cent to 1 per cent. Today marks the fourth meeting in a row since December that the Bank has upped interest rates.  The MPC voted by a majority of 6-3 to increase Bank Rate, as it is officially known, by 0.25 percentage points, but the members in the minority were not advocating that rates should be held and instead preferred a 0.5 percentage points rise to 1.25 per cent.  The Bank also upped its forecast for UK inflation, which it now believes will average 10 per cent in the final three months of the year as autumn turns to winter and higher energy bills bite. The MPC said: 'In the May Report central projection, CPI inflation is expected to rise further over the remainder of the year, to just over 9 per cent in 2022 Q2 [second quarter] and averaging slightly over 10 per cent at its peak in 2022 Q4.  'The majority of that further increase reflects higher household energy prices following the large rise in the Ofgem price cap in April and projected additional large increase in October.  'The price cap mechanism means that it takes some time for increases in wholesale gas and electricity prices, and their respective futures curves, to be reflected in retail energy prices.  'Given the operation of the price cap, consumer price inflation is likely to peak later in the United Kingdom than in many other economies, and may therefore fall back later. The expected rise in CPI inflation also reflects higher food, core goods and services prices.' Consumer prices index inflation has already hit a 30-year high of 7 per cent in March - way above the 2 per cent target - and is forecast to peak in double-digits. Central banks initially believed that the inflationary surge of the Covid recovery would be transitory, however, price rises across the economy affecting consumers and businesses have become persistent. The Bank of England and other major central banks are now fighting to avoid high inflationary expectations becoming baked in to consumer, worker and business expectations. The basic principle behind monetary policy is that by raising the cost of borrowing, central banks can reduce demand for it and reduce the amount of money being created by banks through loans that flows through into the economy. Today's interest rate hike will hit around 2million borrowers with variable rate mortgages, but about three quarters of UK mortgages are protected in the near term by fixed rates. Savers look set to, in theory, see their returns grow further, with the best savings rates already having risen substantially in recent months. Businesses will see non-fixed rate lending and new borrowing costs rise.  > Compare the best fixed mortgage rates that you could apply for  The Monetary Policy Report alongside the rate decision sets out the Bank of England's market-implied path for the base rate. This sees Bank Rate rising to 2.5 per cent by the middle of next year, before falling back to 2 per cent at the end of the forecast period. Although this would see interest rates remain low by historic standards, they would be far higher than was expected until recent months. The Bank's rate hike comes as the rising cost of living and the war in Ukraine have slowed down the recovery of the key services sector, according to fresh figures.  The cost of living crisis is set to worsen further in October, when another increase in the energy cap is expected.  The latest S&P Global/CIPS business UK services Purchasing Managers' Index scored 58.9 in April, down from 62.6 in March. Services firms, which range from banks to hairdressers, account for 80 per cent of the total UK economic output, so a slowdown indicates a loss of momentum in the whole economy. Businesses recorded the fastest rise in costs in almost 26 years in April, with energy, wages and fuel all going up in price. In turn, companies hiked prices they charge to customers at close to record pace. New business growth slowed sharply and was the weakest so far this year. Meanwhile, business confidence dropped to the lowest in a year and half as firms worried about rising costs. Andrew Harker, economics director at S&P Global, said: 'The twin headwinds of the cost-of-living crisis and the war in Ukraine started to bite on the UK service sector during April, as evidenced by a sharp slowdown in new order growth to the lowest in the year so far. 'Worryingly, companies seem to be expecting impacts to be prolonged, with business confidence dropping to the lowest in a year-and-a-half. 'Indeed, cost pressures show little sign of abating, with inflation even accelerating in April to the strongest in almost 26 years of data collection. 'The feeding through of these cost pressures to charges for customers means that the spell of rapid inflation clearly has further to run.' Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said figures suggest the UK economy is in for a sharp slowdown this quarter. 'The forward-looking indices of April's survey fell back at a faster rate than the headline index, suggesting growth in activity will slow further during Q2. 'This evidence of a loss of private sector momentum reinforces the EY ITEM Club's expectation that GDP growth will slow significantly in Q2.'   On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve unveiled its biggest interest rate hike in over two decades as it toughens its fight against rapidly surging prices.  The Fed said it was upping its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, to a range of 0.75 per cent to 1 per cent after a smaller rise in March. With US inflation at a 40-year high, further hikes are expected, just as they are in the UK. The push from the Fed marks the latest effort to contain spiking costs being felt by households around the world. On Wednesday, India's central bank announced an unexpected increase to its benchmark rate, while Australia's central bank recently enacted its first interest rate hike in more than a decade.",
    "68128d5f2dd38b535c80177e24aa8e8431874be88ecec3e1f4f687ee": "A kind-hearted car dealer who is housing a family of eight Ukrainian refugees at his country manor home said they are 'such humble people' as he slammed the red tape needed to bring them to the UK. Martin Holton, 59, paid to bring them over from Poland, and is putting them up at his luxury PS5million, 16-room home in South Warwickshire. His housekeeper is the only other person occupying the property, so the businessman insists there's plenty of space for his guests to make the most of. Martin, who runs Country Car Barford, has given sanctuary to Tamara Zastryzhna, 36, and her children Valeriia, 14, and Kseniia, 11; her sister Tetiana Maksymenko, 34, and her twins Sofiia and Illia, four; and Olha Pastushenko, 34 - an old school friend of Mrs Zastryzhna - and her daughter Vladyslava, 14. After fleeing their home town of Mykolaiv, they were stuck in Poland for five weeks waiting for their visa applications to be approved, forcing them to spend all the money they had on food and accommodation.  Once the visas were granted, Martin used his own money to get the refugees to safety, and is now appealing for donations to help the family get back on their feet, but was left frustrated by the experience. He told MailOnline: 'The visa process was horrendous. You have to 'tag' each person in the group to one another. It just takes ages, and then you go so long without hearing anything.  'It's supposed to be two days, then it becomes five days, then suddenly it's weeks. We think some of the paperwork got lost and had to use the local MP to try and make sense of it all.  'It's very frustrating, and I can only imagine how they were feeling, having been living in a one-bedroom apartment with 10 other people, sleeping on the floor while they wait.  Martin was determined to help as soon he saw the horrific images on the news of the desperate plight of Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invaders. He has worked with the Ukraine Embassy in London and Coventry Refugee and Migrant Centre to place refugees with him at his home near Leamington. Martin added that the family have settled in well to the huge property - which dates back to 1903 but was severely damaged by fire in 2010, and took nearly a decade to rebuild. He said: 'They are such humble people, they don't moan about anything, they just think 'this is what we've got to do'. 'It's been lovely living with them. We all get up together in the morning, they have their buckwheat for breakfast and then I go off to work. 'We've celebrated a couple of birthdays while they've been here so have been out for dinner. 'The property is on a farm and it's all fenced in with cameras, so it's very safe, and there's plenty of space for the kids to run around in. I've also got them bikes and scooters to play on. 'Does it impact my life? It's different, but I do it because I can, and we have a big community of people here willing to help. 'Would I take eight English people in? No. Would I take one English person in? Probably not. These people are so grateful and thankful and they're just not a problem. You wouldn't think they've gone through what they have.' Along with his team at the garage, Martin has also started an aid collection to help Ukrainians who have been unable to escape. He said: 'I just felt I needed to do something however small, they need as much help as they can get from everyone. I've already made one drop to Ukraine, and we're still taking donations.' The team is asking for specific items including non-perishable food, generators and medical equipment. Martin added: 'The team have been amazing, especially Helen Aris, she helped with all the visa applications. We couldn't have done it without her help.' Those wishing to donate can do so here.  Martin is not the first British businessman to offer up his home to Ukrainian refugees, after automation boss Mick Swinhoe did something similar back in March. The four-generation family of 10 'lost everything' before fleeing war-torn Kharkiv, but said they felt like they 'have a home again' after moving into the house in Cambridgeshire. The family were helped in their journey to the UK by relative Roman Starkov, who is a British citizen. The 38-year-old, also from Cambridge, has lived in the UK for 20 years since travelling to the country to study. The software developer helped his family through the visa process which he described as 'pretty involved'. One of the family members, Valeriia Starkova, 37, expressed her relief and gratitude that Mr Swinhoe opened the doors for them.  'I can feel maybe I have a home again because I feel that I lost everything that I had,' she said. 'My kids (Alikhan, 10, and Kamila, 11) lost everything. 'I did so much, my family, for us to live there, to earn money, nice place to live, work for kids. We lost in one day everything. 'I had really nice job that I love, nail technician, but I really love my job. I feel that I need to start again from zero.'  The British Government announced a visa scheme to help Ukrainians fleeing their homeland after the conflict broke out, but have faced criticism over the 'endless' delays facing families trying to reach safety. Boris Johnson admitted this week the UK could have reacted faster, amid a class action lawsuit, which is being prepared against Priti Patel over the failures. Would-be sponsors under the Homes for Ukraine visa scheme are threatening the Government with legal action on behalf of hundreds of Ukrainian refugees who have spent weeks waiting to come to Britain. At least 800 Ukrainian refugees are still waiting for visas after applying within the first two weeks of the scheme opening. In total, 59,000 Ukrainians who have been granted visas have still not arrived in the UK, despite the Russian invasion taking place more than two months ago. The Prime Minister said on Tuesday: 'Well, we have done a huge amount to help Ukrainian women and children in the area but we're now seeing large numbers come to the UK. 'So far, 86,000 visas have been issued and 27,000 are already here and I want to say, thank you - 27,000 is a lot and it's growing fast and I want to pay tribute to all those who are helping to look after Ukrainians. 'Could we have done it faster? Yes, perhaps we could.' Asked why the UK is not offering visa-free travel to Ukrainians, Mr Johnson said that in a wartime situation, some people might be 'pretending' to be refugees. Readers of Mail Newspapers and MailOnline have always shown immense generosity at times of crisis. Calling upon that human spirit, we are supporting a huge push to raise money for refugees from Ukraine. For, surely, no one can fail to be moved by the heartbreaking images and stories of families - mostly women, children, the infirm and elderly - fleeing from the bombs and guns. As this tally of misery increases over the coming days and months, these innocent victims of this conflict will require accommodation, schools and medical support.

    "7d693ffb511d5f4f261ddf6a15c09e4460a31a2a0b2809c96a575e71": "The husband of a carer who forged the will of a wealthy landowner before she starved him to death has lost a bid to appeal against his conviction in the case. Wayne Rickard, 67, was jailed for a total of 10 and a half years in June last year after he was found guilty of causing or allowing the death of a vulnerable adult, 59-year-old James Sootheran. His wife Lynda Rickard was convicted of murdering the former auctioneer's clerk, known as Anthony, at his home High Havens Farm in the village of South Newington, Oxfordshire, in March 2014, so she could inherit a slice of his PS3.5 million fortune. Following a hearing at the Court Appeal in London on Thursday, Wayne Rickard's bid to challenge his conviction and sentence was rejected by senior judges. His barrister Christopher Donnellan QC argued that, having been cleared of Mr Sootheran's murder after a trial at Reading Crown Court, an issue arose over Rickard's 'state of mind'. He added that the state of mind alleged by the prosecution 'required him to have a knowledge that effectively made him complicit in the murder'. Mr Donnellan said of the trial jury: 'If they have taken a decision that he was not sufficiently involved in the joint enterprise of murder there isn't in fact anything for him to be aware of.' The lawyer also argued that the eight-year sentence handed to Rickard for the charge of causing or allowing the death of a vulnerable adult should be reduced to account for a 'lower level of culpability'. But Lady Justice Macur, sitting with Mr Justice Griffiths and Mr Justice Eyre, dismissed his appeal bids, finding the trial judge made no errors. She noted that the judge had given 'appropriately tailored' directions to the jury over the evidence to be considered on the charges faced by Rickard. Lady Justice Macur said there had been 'no error of law nor any factual mistake' that would make his conviction appeal 'arguable'. She added that it was also not arguable that his sentence was 'manifestly excessive' and 'no legitimate criticism' could be made over how it was calculated by the judge. The trial judge noted the 'prolonged period of neglect', a failure to act and a 'deliberate disregard for Anthony Sootheran's welfare', in his sentencing, Lady Justice Macur said. Jurors were told that Lynda Rickard was paid PS47,000 a year to look after Mr Sootheran's elderly mother, Mary Sootheran, known as Joy, until her death aged 92 in 2012. She lived at the farm with her American-born husband Wayne before they were evicted in 2017. Lynda Rickard admitted helping herself to tens of thousands of pounds of the Sootherans' money to fund her family's lifestyle, including private school fees for her three now-adult children. She also admitted forging the mother and son's wills, which would have entitled her to half of Mrs Sootheran's PS1.5million estate and a third of Mr Sootheran's PS3.5million fortune. Mr Sootheran, who owned the farm, including 60 acres of land, was more than 6ft tall but weighed less than nine stone, having lost so much weight due to malnutrition, when he was found dead on 18 March 2014. Lynda Rickard did not give evidence at trial, but denied murder, claiming the death of Mr Sootheran - described as 'a recluse prone to gross self-neglect' with 'complex mental health issues' - was a result of how he lived his life. She was found guilty and handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 28 years. Lynda and Wayne Rickard, formerly of Edinburgh Close, Banbury, Oxfordshire, were also found guilty of fraud by false representation, relating to a PS33,000 Mitsubishi Shogun paid for with Mrs Sootheran's money in 2010, while Wayne Rickard was convicted of perverting the course of justice. Lynda Rickard, aged 62 at the time of her sentencing, pleaded guilty to four fraud charges, two counts of forgery, two counts of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, possession of articles for use in fraud and obtaining benefits by deception. Mr Justice Wall, sentencing Wayne Rickard, told him: 'You were the only person who could have saved Anthony Sootheran, but instead of doing so you left him to die the most horrible of deaths. 'I can only conclude you decided not to help him because you hoped to profit from his death when, as you expected, your wife inherited a substantial sum of money from him.'",
    "3e69ff2d1e4c260cbf5c847ced18014a7e4f80f45691c5e3f2d2dab7": "Boris Johnson's former Downing Street Svengali has urged voters from across the political spectrum to unite to kick him out of office in a sensational election day attack.  Lambasting the Prime Minister as 'pointless', Vote Leave mastermind Dominic Cummings this afternoon urged Remains, Brexiteers and those on the  left and right of politics to join forces to deliver 'regime change'.   Mr Cummings, who was booted out in December 2020 after losing a power struggle with Mr Johnson's wife, accused the Conservatives of being 'politically, & organisationally rancid' in a Twitter tirade. He accused them of focusing too much on 'culture war' issues like trans rights at the expense of law and order and the economy. It came as Mr Johnson braces for a battering over Partygate today as voters go to the polls in local elections - with the outcome in key battlegrounds set to decide his fate. The PM has cast his own ballot in Westminster as Tories anxiously wait to assess the damage from the Downing Street scandal, with thousands of councillors being elected across the country. Using his favourite description of Mr Johnson as a 'wonky shopping trolley' on Twitter, Mr Cummings said: 'Vote Tory = more... taxes, regulation, sh*t bureaucracy, violent/sex crime, neglect of security/armed forces, A&E disasters / NHS neglect, chance of nuclear war ... while idiots babbling about trans & other sh*te get promoted all over SW1. 'Tories and their wider support in media/'think tanks' etc are so intellectually, politically, and organisationally rancid that a change of leader may well not change these dynamics, but there is NO chance of even discussing serious change unless the [wonky shopping trolley] is replaced. 'Only point of [wonky shopping trolley] as PM was to act as spokesman for the Vote Leave agenda while we pushed everything in a different direction. Once this was 99 per cent abandoned in 2020 the entire spectacle is pointless *for all except the [wonky shopping trolley] himself* who enjoys riding his bike at Chequers etc 'Unless you're someone like Nadine [Dorries, the Culture Secretary] or the Telegraph ('the real boss') or Zelensky's social media crew, it's irrational to prop up the (clown) show any more. 'Remain/brexit/left/right/political/official, all shd unite in removing pointless fkd'. He is not the only former high ranking Tory who advocated voting against the party today. Ex-minister Nick Boles, who quite Parliament in 2019, revealed today he had voted for Labour.   A dire set of results could be terminal for Mr Johnson, as MPs mull whether to launch a coup bit after he was fined for breaking lockdown rules.  Midnight Friday: First results expected. Labour is hoping to do well in Conservative-run Bolton in Greater Manchester. The Tories could make gains in Basildon in Essex. Results from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, South Tyneside and Wigan will indicate if Labour's vote is holding up in its northern strongholds. From 2am: Sunderland has been run by Labour since 1973 but the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are hoping to make enough gains to leave the council in no overall control. Both Labour and the Tories are battling for control of Hartlepool and Peterborough. Stevenage in Hertfordshire could show if Labour is making gains in commuter territory. From 3am: First key results from London. Westminster is a Labour longshot and has been run by the Conservatives continuously since 1964. In both Hammersmith & Fulham and Redbridge the Tories are fighting to hold on to a dwindling number of councillors. Elsewhere Hull is a two-way fight between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. From 4am: Two crucial results are due from the West Midlands. The Conservatives are defending a slim majority in Dudley and a larger one in Nuneaton & Bedworth; Labour hopes to make progress on both councils. Hillingdon is another Labour longshot in London and contains within its boundary the constituency of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. From 5am: Labour is hoping to retake Southampton from Conservative control and make gains in Derby. The Conservatives are defending Wandsworth in London which they have held since 1978. By 7am: The final result is due from Conservative-run Barnet, Labour's top target in London. All outstanding overnight results are also due. Around 9am: Counting begins for a further 71 councils in England and all councils in Scotland and Wales. From 12pm: Results likely to resume in England. The Green party is hoping to make gains in Conservative-controlled Solihull. Labour is hoping to do likewise in Tory-run Walsall. First results are also due from Scotland and for the mayoral elections in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham and Watford. From 2pm: Two key councils in West Sussex are due to declare: Worthing, a top Labour target; and Crawley, where both the Tories and Labour are hoping to gain control. The Liberal Democrats could make gains in West Oxfordshire. East Renfrewshire is a three-way battle between the Conservatives, Labour and the SNP. First results are due from Wales. From 3pm: Another key Conservative-Labour battleground, Newcastle-under-Lyme in Staffordshire, is due to finish counting. In Wales, Labour is looking to take control of Blaenau Gwent from a group of Independents, while Flintshire is a test of Tory popularity in an area in which they did well at the 2019 general election. Aberdeenshire will be a measure of Conservative support in Scotland, while all parties hope to pick up seats in Edinburgh. From 4pm: The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are fighting for control of the new unitary authority in Somerset. In Glasgow, the SNP is looking to hold off any sign of a Labour resurgence. The Lib Dems hope to strengthen control of St Albans and the Tories want to keep control of Pendle in Lancashire. The result of the South Yorkshire mayoral election is also due. From 5pm: The Lib Dems hope to cause an upset in Tory-run Gosport in Hampshire. Labour is defending a slim majority in Cardiff. The result in Labour-run Wakefield could offer clues to the outcome of the expected parliamentary by-election in the city later this year, after Conservative MP Imran Khan was convicted of sexual assault. Tower Hamlets in London is due to declare the result of its mayoral election. Renfrewshire is the last result due from Scotland. Friday evening: North Hertfordshire could see both Labour and the Lib Dems gaining from the Conservatives. Labour is hoping to improve its majority in Bury in Greater Manchester. Vale of Glamorgan is the final result due from Wales. In London, the Croydon mayoral result is expected. Saturday, around 5pm: Final result due from Tower Hamlets.  Saturday afternoon/evening: Results in Northern Ireland finalised.  Where can you follow the results? MailOnline will be covering the election results through the night as they come in. Sky News has a live election programme from 11pm, and BBC One from 11.40pm.   However, there have been wildly varying predictions about how bad it will be. Some experts have suggested the Conservatives face losing 800 councillors with a hammering from Labour and the Lib Dems in the so-called 'Blue Wall' zones. But others point out that Keir Starmer's party performed very strongly in England in 2018, the last time most of the seats were contested.       Analysis for the New Statesman estimated that the Tories will be stripped of around 200, and most of the pain will be in Scotland, Wales and central London. Strikingly Labour could actually go backwards in England outside of the capital - something that would be seized on by No10 as evidence that the Red Wall is holding up. Meanwhile, YouGov anticipates that Labour will scoop up seats but might struggle to gain councils, and the advance will probably much weaker in the North.   The first council results will start coming out after midnight, but the full picture in England will not be clear until later in the morning. Authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - where a new assembly is being elected - are not starting to count until tomorrow. Northern Ireland might not be complete until Saturday evening.    Mr Johnson looked in good spirits as he appeared at Methodist Central Hall in Westminster to cast his vote this morning. The premier smiled and wished reporters a good morning, but was otherwise tight-lipped. In a selfie video posted on social media afterwards, Mr Johnson appealed for people to focus on the local Tory candidates. 'It is Conservatives who deliver,' he said. 'It is Conservatives who get the bins collected, fill in pot holes... '  Sir Keir cast his ballot in the local elections for Camden Council at a polling station in Kentish Town, north London. The Labour leader and his wife were inside the community hall for about two minutes as they voted. As they left, he smiled and said to the staff on the door: 'Thanks, have a good day.' He then said 'Morning, how are you?' to photographers and camera operators outside. Millions of voters are casting ballots to select more than 4,000 councillors to run local services and facilities - but turnout is expected to be low as voters make clear their distaste at politicians in general.  Areas up for grabs include parts of the Red Wall such as Bury, as well as Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and all 32 London boroughs. Bolton, Peterborough, St Albans, Hillingdon, Wandsworth, Barnet and Worthing are among the crucial places being fought over.  Scotland and Wales are also being fought over, while in Northern Ireland a crucial set of assembly elections are taking place.  During a visit to Southampton Airport yesterday, Mr Johnson stressed that he was 'absolutely confident' he had the 'right agenda for the country'. Key results include true-blue London local authorities such as Wandsworth - under Conservative control for the past 44 years - Westminster and Barnet where pollsters YouGov believe Labour could cause an upset.   Sir Keir used his election rallying call to highlight the 'constant drip-drip of sleaze and scandal' in Mr Johnson's administration. As well as Partygate, the Tories have been hit with a string of controversies, including former Wakefield MP Imran Nasir Ahmad Khan being found guilty of sexually assaulting a teenage boy and veteran MP Neil Parish quitting after admitting he watched pornography in the Commons. Sir Keir said the Government had broken the Covid regulations they had put in place 'over and over again' and said the Tory 'failure' to tackle the cost of living crisis had been a 'disgrace', along with the Chancellor's decision to hike national insurance last month. Writing in the Daily Mirror, Sir Keir said: 'The British public shouldn't have to put up with a Government that refuses to take seriously the very real issues facing you and your family.' However, the Labour leader has also been struggling to fend off questions about his own alleged lockdown breach, amid claims he ordered PS200 of curry for up to 30 aides at around 10pm during a visit to Durham last year. He was pictured drinking beer at the gathering, but insists his team were working.  Tory polling expert Lord Hayward suggested that the party's losses could be between 250 and 350. He told MailOnline: 'One of the things that is becoming clear is that people you talk to are stating anti-Boris, anti-London, anti-Westminster things.' He said some candidates were branding themselves 'local Conservatives'. In Hartlepool some hopefuls have added a note to their election literature asking people not to punish them for the behaviour of national politicians. When are the local elections?  Polling stations opened at 7am and will close at 10pm. What is up for grabs?  Local council elections are happening in England, but not in all areas. More than 4,000 councillors in 146 councils will be standing for election in major cities including Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and all 32 London boroughs. South Yorkshire will also be voting for a regional mayor and 1,000 parish councils will be electing around 10,000 councillors. All 32 councils in Scotland and all 22 in Wales will be holding elections, with residents able to vote from the age of 16. In Northern Ireland, voters will be electing 90 members, representing 18 constituencies, to the Northern Ireland Assembly. When will the results be announced?  The first batch of results is likely to be announced at midnight, with locations such as Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Essex, Greater Manchester and Bolton traditionally announced around this time. The latest is likely to be around 5pm on Saturday from Tower Hamlets. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not start counting until tomorrow morning and the results are unlikely to be complete before Saturday evening.  'They are a growing number of people who are openly dissenting from Boris and trying to separate themselves from Boris,' the peer said.  Lord Hayward also said postal votes seemed to be down by 7 per cent to 10 per cent compared to 2018 - suggesting that turnout will be low.  'I don't think this will benefit any one party but more that the electorate is saying 'a plague on all your houses',' the peer said. 'I do not expect a compensatory higher turnout on the day. More a case of a general decline in overall turnout. 'In 2018 all local authorities in England averaged 34.7 per cent... My expectation is therefore that turnout will be hard pushed to reach 30 per cent in 2022.' The first batch of results is likely to be announced at midnight, with locations such as Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Essex, Greater Manchester and Bolton traditionally announced around this time. The latest is likely to be around 5pm on Saturday from Tower Hamlets. The councils in England that will receive most attention are in London, where Wandsworth could swing to Labour after 44 years of being in the hands of the Tories. Recently, the area has been drifting to the left, with all three of the borough's MPs now Labour, including Fleur Anderson in Putney, which was the only seat the party gained from the Tories in 2019. The Conservatives also face challenges in Westminster, with their large majority diminishing over the years, and Barnet, where Labour's poor performance in 2018 has been associated with concerns about Jeremy Corbyn among the Jewish community. In Tower Hamlets, while there are unlikely to be too many upsets in the council elections, the race to become mayor will be one to watch, with controversial former mayor Lutfur Rahman standing again. He was forced to step down after an election court found him guilty of corrupt and illegal practices, but he has faced no criminal prosecution. In other parts of the country, Hartlepool will be hotly contested. The Conservatives won the parliamentary seat from Labour at a by-election in May 2021 and will have to demonstrate that the faith voters put in them was not misplaced. On the other hand, Labour will hope to start to rebuild its Red Wall. In Bury, residents voted last year to keep Labour in control of its council, but during the 2019 general election they voted in two Tory MPs - one of these being Christian Wakeford, who has since defected to Labour. In the South of England, Tories will be hoping not to give any more ground to the Liberal Democrats, after losing two safe Tory seats at by-elections in less than a year. Wokingham, St Albans and Sutton are some of the key Conservative-Liberal Democrat battlegrounds. In the last election in 2017 in Scotland, the Conservative made big gains from Labour but failed to gain overall control, leaving most councils run by coalitions. The largest cities - Glasgow and Edinburgh - will be the ones to look out for. Parties north of the border have urged voters to 'send a message' to the Governments in Westminster and Holyrood with their votes. The cost-of-living crisis, prompted by an increase in fuel bills, national insurance contributions and inflation, has been top of the agenda for Scotland's parties throughout the campaign. But it is the impact of Partygate that could overshadow the chances of the Conservatives. Paired with the resignation of MP Neil Parish on Wednesday, after he admitted watching porn in the House of Commons, the situation at Westminster has dominated much of the campaign. The Scottish Tories have also seen a downturn in fortunes in the polls over the past few months, dropping to third behind Scottish Labour in surveys done for Westminster, Holyrood and local council votes. Polls open on Thursday at 7am and close at 10pm. While overnight counts have been the norm, Scotland's counting will take place on Friday, with final results expected in the early evening. The Single Transferable Vote (STV) will be the electoral system employed during voting, where Scots will be asked to rank their preferred candidates by number, with one being the most preferred. In the counting process, a formula is used to calculate the representatives elected to each ward in Scotland's 32 local authority areas. Despite the expectation that counting will be complete by Friday evening, the overall control of councils will not be known for some time. The STV system rarely, if ever, provides an overall majority for any one party, meaning parties will be forced to run councils as a minority administration or enter into formal coalitions. In Wales, attention will be on whether Labour can maintain its hold over Cardiff and the cities along the M4 corridor. Meanwhile, tensions are high in Northern Ireland ahead of the Stormont Assembly elections as the Brexit protocol remains a divisive issue. The Northern Ireland Executive collapsed in February and it is possible it will not be restored after the elections, particularly if Sinn Fein comes first. The DUP and Sinn Fein are vying for the top spot in the Assembly which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next First Minister. A unionist party has always been the biggest in the Assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of the state in 1921. This year a number of opinion polls have suggested that Sinn Fein will finish ahead of the DUP to become the first nationalist or republican party to come top. While the office of the First and deputy First Minister is an equal one with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. A surge for the centre-ground Alliance Party has also been suggested in pre-election polls. Sir Jeffrey has stated he is confident his party will win the election. He is running for election to the Assembly in Lagan Valley, the constituency he represents in the House of Commons. Oliver Dowden, the Tory Party chairman, looked to emphasise to the electorate the local choice they are making amid reports that some candidates had attempted to distance themselves from Westminster during campaigning. In a statement to mark polls opening, Mr Dowden said: 'The elections today are about one thing: who do you want running your council? 'The choice couldn't be starker - between Conservatives who keep council tax down and offer good services, or the opposition parties who waste money on political games and vanity projects.' Education minister Michelle Donelan argued that Mr Johnson was 'an asset, not a liability' in elections. Ms Donelan told Sky News she could 'understand' why councillor hopefuls wanted to show they are 'going to be working hard on all of those things that impact daily life' rather than focusing on what is happening in Westminster. Environment Secretary George Eustice acknowledged that 'all prime ministers will always be very conscious of the mood in their parliamentary party', in response to speculation that poor results on Thursday could lead to more letters of no confidence from Tory MPs. The local election battlegrounds that could decide the PM's fate  Here are some of the key contests to look out for in each region of England, as well as in Wales and Scotland. North-west England Bury - estimated declaration time, 8.30pm Friday May 6 Bury has all of its 51 seats up for grabs this year. Labour has run the council since 2011 but has only a small majority and will want to improve its position in what is the party's traditional heartland of Greater Manchester. Bury's status in this year's elections was reflected by the fact Sir Keir and Mr Johnson both visited the town during the campaign. (E) Bolton - 12.30am Friday May 6 Bolton is another key test for Labour in Greater Manchester, but here it is hoping to take back control from the Conservatives who have run a minority administration since 2019. A third of the council's 60 seats are being contested. (12.30am) Pendle - 4.30pm Friday, May 6 Pendle is being defended by the Conservatives, who won a slim majority last year. If the Tories lose two seats, the council will slip back into no overall control. Elections are taking place for 12 of the 33 seats. (4.30pm) Cumberland and Westmorland & Furness - 1pm Friday, May 6  Two new unitary authorities that will elect councillors for the first time this year. The two authorities cover the whole of Cumbria. Cumberland is comprised of the former district councils of Allerdale, Carlisle and Copeland, while Westmorland & Furness covers Barrow-in-Furness, Eden and South Lakeland. All the main parties will be jostling for prominence in these new 'super-councils' and the outcome in both contests could be close. (Cumberland 2.30am, Westmorland & Furness 1pm) North-east England Sunderland - 2am Friday, May 6 Run by Labour since 1973, but both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have made advances in Sunderland in recent years. A third of the council's 75 seats are up for grabs this year, and if Labour suffers six or more losses it will lose overall control. Although Sunderland is part of Labour's so-called 'Red Wall' - areas of the country that saw many Tory gains at the 2019 general election - all three Sunderland MPs are Labour and the party defied predictions in 2021 when it retained its majority on the council.  Hartlepool - 2am Friday, May 6  The Conservatives and Labour are fighting to be in with a chance of taking overall control of the council - or failing that, end up the largest party and lead a minority administration or a coalition. The Tories won the parliamentary seat of Hartlepool from Labour at a by-election in May 2021. A strong showing by independent candidates could spice up the outcome of this year's contest. Some 13 of the council's 36 seats are being contested. Yorkshire & the Humber Kirklees - 6.30pm Friday, May 6 Currently run by Labour but the party does not have a majority in Kirklees. A third of seats are being elected and just two gains by Labour would give it overall control. Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are also hoping to do well.  Wakefield - 5pm Friday, May 6 A Labour stronghold and is not likely to change hands, but the party will be hoping for a solid performance ahead of the expected parliamentary by-election in the city later this year, after Conservative MP Imran Khan was convicted of sexual assault. A third of seats are being contested.  Hull - 3.30am Friday, May 6  Hull is a two-way fight between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Labour's majority has been whittled away in recent years and the party goes into this year's election defending a majority of one. A third of the council's seats are in play and the Lib Dems are hopeful of victory. (3.30am) West Midlands Dudley - 4am Friday, May 6 A crucial test for both the Conservatives and Labour. The Tories hope to build on the slim majority they secured at the 2021 local elections, while Labour will want to halt the blue advance and make gains themselves. A third of the council is up for grabs. (4am) Solihull - 1pm Friday May 6 Another West Midlands metropolitan council under Conservative control, but the main opposition is the Greens. The party has been slowly eating into the Tories' majority and will hope to take a few more bites this year. One third of Solihull's seats are being contested. Nuneaton & Bedworth - 4am Friday May 6 Dominated by the Conservatives after a bumper performance in last year's elections. Labour will hope to demonstrate it is making a comeback, having controlled the council as recently as 2018. Half of the 34 seats are holding ballots. Newcastle-under-Lyme - 3pm Friday May 6 Set to be a battle royal between Labour and the Conservatives, with every council seat up for grabs and the Tories defending a tiny majority. Success here for Labour would suggest the party is winning back support in one of its target areas of country. The parliamentary seat of Newcastle-under-Lyme was won by the Conservatives in 2019 after being held by Labour for the previous 100 years.  East Midlands Derby - 5am Friday May 6 Derby is currently run by the Tories as a minority party. Labour will be looking to make gains in another test of party's ability to win back support in urban areas of central England. An unknown factor is the popularity of the Reform Derby party, based on the former Brexit Party, which is standing candidates in all the seats being contested. There are 17 of the council's 51 seats up for grabs.  Eastern England St Albans - 4pm Friday May 6 St Albans saw the Liberal Democrats make enough gains in 2021 to take overall control, but with a slim majority. The party will want to improve its numbers this year as an example of how it is now the main opposition to the Conservatives in parts of the so-called 'Blue Wall' of southern England. The entire council is up for election. (4pm) Peterborough - 2.30am Friday May 6  A long-running Conservative-Labour battleground and for decades the council has see-sawed between a Tory majority and no overall control. It is currently run by a minority Conservative administration and Labour will want to make gains to show it is recovering in a city it lost to the Tories at the 2019 general election. A third of seats are being contested.  Basildon - 1am Friday May 6 This Essex battleground could provide clues to how the Conservatives are doing in the commuter belt around London. The party won control of the council last year and will hope to consolidate its position in elections for a third of its 42 seats.  Stevenage - 2.30am Friday, May 6 A commuter-heavy area in Hertfordshire, but this time it is Labour who will be hoping to make progress. The party has controlled the council continuously since its creation in 1973 but will want to show it can reverse the losses it made last year. A third of the seats are up for grabs.  London Barnet - 7am Friday May 6 Labour's top target in London for the third election in a row. The party failed narrowly to win control in 2014, while 2018 saw the council swing further towards the Conservatives, with local Labour members blaming the row over antisemitism in the national party. Labour needs to gain nine seats to form a majority. As with every council in London, all seats are being elected.  Wandsworth - 5.30am Friday May 6 Another long-standing Labour target, but here the party managed to increased its number of councillors in both 2014 and 2018. The Tories have held the council since 1978 and have made a point of charging residents one of the lowest average levels of council tax in the country, so a Labour victory would be of symbolic significance.  Hillingdon - 4am Friday May 6  This borough contains the constituency of the Prime Minister and has been controlled by the Conservatives since 2006. Labour is hoping to make gains, but the outcome is hard to predict as the size of the council is being cut from 65 to 53 seats. Westminster - 3am Friday May 6 A flagship borough held by the Tories continuously since its creation in 1964. But Labour has slowly increased its number of councillors at recent elections and will want to make more progress this time. Given the current volatile political climate, plus a reduction in the size of the council from 60 to 54 seats, the final result could be close.  Harrow - 5pm Friday May 6  A council where the reduction in the number of seats from 63 to 55 could work in either Labour or the Conservatives' favour. Labour won a narrow majority in both 2014 and 2018 but the borough's electoral districts have been substantially redrawn for 2022 and both parties could profit from the new-look map.  Sutton - 4am Friday May 6 A Liberal Democrat-Conservative battleground that has been run by the Lib Dems since 1990. The party should retain control again this year, but the Tories will hope to make gains and chip away at the Lib Dems' small overall majority.  South-east England Crawley - 2pm Friday, May 6 Has tilted between Conservative and Labour control in recent years but neither party has an overall majority. It would take only a couple of gains for either the Tories or Labour to take full control of a council deep in the commuter belt of West Sussex. A third of seats are being contested.  Gosport - 5pm Friday May 6 The council sees the Conservatives, who have only a small majority, under pressure from the second-place Lib Dems. All the seats are up for grabs and boundary changes across the borough means the outcome will be even more unpredictable.  Worthing - 2pm Friday May 6 A top Labour target and the party goes into the election level-pegging with the Conservatives on 17 seats each. The Tories currently run the council as a minority administration but Labour has made steady gains in recent years and is hoping to take full control this year. A third of seats are being elected. Southampton - 5am Friday May 6 Another Labour target and winning control from the Conservatives would help demonstrate the party is building back support in southern towns and cities. The Tories are defending a majority of two and a third of the seats are being contested.  South-west England Somerset - 4pm Friday May 6 Undergoing major changes this year in its system of local government. Until now the area has had a county council and four district councils (Mendip, Sedgemoor, South Somerset and Somerset West & Taunton) but these are being scrapped and replaced with a single unitary authority. Elections are taking place for all 110 seats in the new-look organisation, with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats fighting for control.  Wales Blaenau Gwent - 3pm Friday, May 6 This council has been run by a group of independents since 2017, some of whom used to be in the Labour Party. Labour is keen to take back control and might be helped by a reduction in the number of seats from 42 to 33.  Cardiff - 5pm Friday May 6 A key council for Labour, where the party will hope to defend its slim majority. The number of councillors is being increased slightly from 75 to 79, which might make the outcome more unpredictable.  Flintshire - 3pm Friday May 6  Sits in an area of Wales, the north east, where the Conservatives did well at the 2019 general election. The party won only six council seats in 2017 compared with Labour's 34, so they are hoping to make an advance this year. For its part, Labour will want to remain the largest party and even win a majority, although the total number of seats is being cut from 70 to 67.  Scotland Aberdeenshire - 3pm Friday May 6 A Conservative stronghold, but like many councils in Scotland, power is shared between several parties. All councils in Scotland are elected using the single transferable vote (STV) system, where voters rank candidates and results are based on preferences rather than the winner-takes-all method used in England. This leads to many councils ending in no overall control, but encourages parties to work together either informally or as part of a coalition. The Tories have run Aberdeenshire in partnership with the Lib Dems and a group of Independents. Their success this year may hinge on the popularity in Scotland of the Tories' UK leader Mr Johnson. East Renfrewshire - 2pm Friday May 6 A three-way battle between the Conservatives, Labour and the SNP with each hoping to end up the largest party.  Edinburgh - 3.30pm Friday May 6 The council has been run by a joint SNP-Labour administration for the last five years, but the Conservatives head into this election as the largest party on the council. The Lib Dems and Greens have a smaller number of councillors but both will hope to make gains from the larger parties.  Glasgow - 4pm Friday May 6  The council has been run by the SNP since 2017 in what has been their first stint in control of the city, albeit as a minority administration. The party needs only a few gains to take full control, but Labour - which had previously run the city since 1980 - is keen to stop them.",
    "18bd76148a47797a8828d3512c4f72862d2a18939486848ae338196d": "Cornish shop owners have said they 'completely rely' on holidaymakers in St Ives and urged locals to 'just move forward' amid a backlash over staycationers and second home owners swamping the seaside town.  Around 540,000 day trippers and more than 220,000 staying tourists visit St Ives in Cornwall every year, with the tourism industry accounting for around 2,800 jobs in the area - that's almost one in four people who live there.  Stefan Harkon, an RNLI lifeguard in the town for many years, said that at times 'people in the town feel that they are just operatives in a theme park', adding: 'We work in an area but we can't live in it.' But Sarah Hocking, who owns the clothing store Fabulous in St Ives, told MailOnline that 85% of her business is funded by tourism, saying: 'You live in a town that is manic at times but you kind of just work around it.'  She added: 'It can sometimes be a bit intense, but you can avoid the town at various times and a lot of the locals do. What we don't want to do is frighten holidaymakers off by how we talk about them. 'It was mad last year but we knew it was never going to be like that again. In fact since Christmas there has been a massive downturn in trade and I know it's not just us.' And Jane Friggens, who runs St Ives' Allotment Deli, said the town 'relies on an increase in footfall' and warned that shops 'are closing every day', adding: 'Can't we all just move forward and get on?' Ms Friggens wrote on Facebook last month: 'We as a tourist town rely on an increase in footfall, whether it's visitors from other parts of Cornwall or further away, we bloody need you. 'Shops are closing every day, landlords are doubling our rents, pubs, restaurants are losing staff and bookings.' She added: 'Can't we all just move forward and get on, don't be rude, whoever you are, we are all trying our best, on minimum wages.'  The post from April 19 was met with widespread approval from fellow business owners in the area.  Sharon Spencer, who runs the holiday rental agency So So St Ives, commented: 'We wouldn't have a business if it wasn't for the holidaymakers, we need visitors, most people are lovely and friendly.' Referring to complaints from Cornish workers over holidaymakers being ill-mannered, Ms Hocking said: 'We can all be rude at times but it's always made out to be the holidaymakers' fault. We've got to be really careful.' And on the surge in second homes, she added: 'I completely sympathise and do think locals have been priced out, but don't believe it's fair to blame second homeowners completely. It's a double-edged sword. 'People can work really hard to buy a second home with some remortgaging their own houses, or others working really hard to buy one with their pension. 'There is a housing shortage but that's an issue everywhere with house prices rocketing and people cashing in.' Her comments come as homes for sale in the area, especially those on the harbourside, now range between PS700,000 and PS1million, with the average price now at PS440,000, more than 17 times the average salary of Cornwall's year-round residents. Families who have lived in St Ives for generations are being forced out as millionaires bank up land or homes, renting them out for up to PS7,000-a-week.  There is now a growing campaign to bring in a 'tourism tax' for those buying second homes and a limit on Airbnb properties in a town where up to a third of children on one estate live in poverty.  'We have a town where the rich people come to on holiday, when in some part of St Ives more than a third of children live below the bread line,' Camilla Dixon, the co-founder of the First Not Second Homes campaign group, said.  'It is having a detrimental effect. We depleted our social housing stock when they were sold in the 80s. Because the value of land has gone up, developers have been land-grabbing and land banking to make more money. It means genuine social housing development are being priced out.' St Ives Town Council admitted there is not much it can do with its tiny budget and even bigger constraints but insisted it will review its neighbourhood plan and the impact of tourism. It is also lobbying Cornwall Council to let it develop land the larger authority is sitting on even though it has been earmarked for social housing, and is campaigning for a limit on Airbnbs in hotspots like St Ives as has happened in places such as Amsterdam or Barcelona. Louise Dwelly, the town clerk, said: 'The level of council tax is going down because there are more second homes which do not pay tax as they are registered as businesses.  'That means the running of the town is more expensive for the people who live here as it is spread across fewer people. We are also campaigning for the law to be changed for a tourism tax.' Current Conservative MP Derek Thomas recently put pressure on his Whitehall colleagues for changes to the law to address the housing crisis in Cornwall by making long-term tenancies more attractive to landlords than holiday lets.  Speaking in a debate about affordable homes in Devon and Cornwall, held in the Houses of Parliament, he said: 'The situation is urgent right now. I have so many constituents who are in a desperate situation and it needs rapid and effective intervention that provides a secure home for life.  'We are losing these valuable homes, that people enjoy because of legislation that applies to private landlords but doesn't necessarily apply to holiday lets. I don't believe it's a level playing-field.' The issue of second homes in St Ives is so acute that in 2016 residents voted to ban new-build housing from being second-homes, with 83 per cent in favour. According to Rightmove, average house prices in the town are now at PS440,000, more than 17 times the median annual earnings of someone in Cornwall. Houses for sale in the town, especially those on the harbourside, regularly appear for sale with price tags ranging up to PS700,000 or PS1million. Despite its PS1million homes overlooking the harbour or Porthmeor Beach, St Ives sadly boasts some of the poorest neighbourhoods in Cornwall. Some 36 per cent of children living on the Penbeagle estate live in poverty. That's 92 children out of the 255 living there. According to the Children's Society vulnerable children in Cornwall are more likely to receive free school meals than five years ago. Data from the Department of Education shows that by the end of the 2020-21 school year, 57 per cent of Cornwall's children in need were eligible for free school meals - up from 40 per cent at the same point in 2016-17. St Ives also faces a shortage of rentals; in 2021, while there were more than 1,000 properties in the town available for short-term holiday let, there was only one long-term house available to rent.",
    "eaae4143c963a3631f013239c04dee4ffbf9804c3da421007d1f532d": "A weapon-obsessed ex-prison guard armed with 'a rapist's toolkit' attacked a prostitute at gunpoint in a seaside Airbnb. Richard Scaife, 46, was carrying an imitation handgun, a bayonet, pierced condom, expired HMP identification badge and gaffer tape, when he was arrested by armed police. Officers then found strips of duct tape stuck to the inside of his jacket after he raped the sex worker twice at an Airbnb in Folkestone, Kent, last November. A huge arsenal of weapons was discovered stockpiled at Scaife's home in Dover, around eight miles away from the Airbnb, shortly after his arrest. Officers uncovered six machetes, fourteen lock-knives, a samurai sword, eight ball-bearing pistols, air rifles plus nunchucks and knuckle-dusters among the haul. At Canterbury Crown Court, Scaife denied any wrongdoing but jurors unanimously convicted him of two counts of rape on Tuesday following a trial. Scaife's victim told jurors he locked the door and grabbed her by the throat after arriving at her property smelling of alcohol the afternoon of November 5, 2021. She told police in a recorded interview played to jurors she thought she was going to be killed during the terrifying ordeal. The woman said: 'He pulled out the gun, I was terrified, but I didn't show him. Inside, I thought 'I'm going to die, this is my last day', 'maybe he killed someone before' - all of this [was going] through my mind. 'I have known many working girls who have been killed, I said 'are you going to kill me?' 'All that was going through my mind was 'am I going to die'. 'I was thinking of my son, I was thinking 'I love you', this is going to be my last day, then I thought I have to be strong.' She told how she tried to diffuse Scaife's rage during the sex attack and managed to calmly talk him down, while also plotting her escape. After the double rape Scaife said he had problems in his romantic life, then asked if she wanted to form a relationship and be friends, the victim added. The woman told police: 'He said 'I have been seeing working girls for 20 years, they just take my money, they rip me off, they take everything away from me'. 'He broke down, he kneeled on the floor crying and I was hugging him, I said 'you can talk to me honey', and he said he really wanted to be friends with me. 'I thought maybe he was going to kidnap me and use me as a sex slave in his apartment. 'He said he wanted to do bad things, 'I wanted to do bad, I was expecting a bad girl but you are not a bad girl'.' She eventually managed to alert her landlord and convince Scaife to leave, as another customer was waiting outside and her phone was repeatedly going off. After she called 999 Scaife was arrested an hour later, equipped with his 'rapist's toolkit', prosecutors said. Daniel Stevenson, prosecuting, said: 'He [Scaife] had weapons both in his car and on his person, he had an expired prison guard's identification badge. 'He had strips of duct tape ready and cut, stuck to the inside of his jacket, ready to place over the woman's mouth if he needed to subdue her. 'He had a condom with a hole in it. He brought with him an air pistol which had the appearance of a handgun. 'We say there is no good reason why he would have an identification card that resembles that of a police officer.' Giving evidence, Scaife argued the duct tape was for 'fixing the window of my car', his victim was setting him up for unknown reasons and he forgot his expired prison ID was even inside his wallet, he claimed. He also told jurors he was taking the air gun and bayonet found inside his car to the nearby Folkestone Angling shop for a refund at the time of his arrest. But the shop owner told the court it had not stocked either item for more than a decade and they would not have provided a refund in any case. Scaife claimed weapons police seized from his home were for legitimate purposes - such as airsoft and martial arts. The arsenal also included wooden coshes, metal asps, foam batons, nun chucks and knuckle-dusters.  Scaife was unanimously convicted of two counts of rape, possessing an imitation firearm to cause fear of violence and carrying a bladed article. He has been remanded in custody and will be sentenced in July at the same court. ",
    "f5d8a78ae8a72bff2b7134bd528f478d5f4d7ed3f8cd607c515313e8": "A British tourist has been arrested in Cyprus after he allegedly ran down and killed a Swedish mother whilst driving a beach buggy in the resort town of Ayia Napa last night. The 25-year-old man allegedly hit Camilla Christina Pamdahl, 46, on a pedestrian crossing as he overtook a car whilst drunk and under the influence of cannabis in the Mediterranean resort town on Wednesday night, police said on Thursday. The Briton fled the scene on foot while Pamdahl, who was on holiday in Cyprus with her five-year-old daughter, was rushed to Famagusta general hospital where she was declared dead on arrival. The mother, from Vastra Gotaland County in Sweden, had left her five-year-old daughter with staff at the hotel's playground so she could buy some groceries, reports the Cyprus Times. But she never returned.  Images from the scene show the twisted remains of the buggy next to the pedestrian crossing and another car.  The rental buggy had overtaken a stopped car on Wednesday night before fatally hitting Pamdahl on a pedestrian crossing on Ayia Napa's Nissi Avenue, police told the Cyprus Mail.  'A young man driving the rental buggy overtook a stopped car, and hit the woman,' a police spokesperson said, adding that the accident occurred at about 6pm local time. The British tourist quickly abandoned his vehicle and left a passenger inside but he was tracked down by police within hours and arrested at 11.30pm local time, cops say. Officers conducted an alcohol test on the man and he was found to have been four times over the legal limit. He also tested positive for cannabis, police said. Pamdahl was killed whilst getting groceries for herself and her five-year-old daughter. Police have since contacted the child's father, who is abroad, to travel to Cyprus to pick up the child.  The girl is currently with officials of the Welfare Office and a child psychologist.  Police sources told KNews that neither the British tourist, his passenger nor the driver of the other vehicle were injured in the incident.   The man is set to appear in court on Thursday.  The Swedish Foreign ministry has confirmed Pamdahl's death and has been contacted for further comment.  ",
    "b186a7145dd364e493928f60d2eb8b1b27df5dbadca35297f6545f06": "It was the biggest single disaster of the Second World War to strike women in the British Army. On May 11, 1943, between 15 and 20 Focke-Wulf planes - the most feared of the German air force - unleashed a devastating bombing raid on Great Yarmouth, in Norfolk. One bomb hit the Imperial Hotel, which was the billet of the local unit of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) - the women's branch of the British Army. A total of twenty-six women - who had just returned from exercising in the morning sun when the bomb hit - were killed instantly. In all, 49 servicemen and women and civilians were killed or later died of their wounds. Only one woman, Private Dorreen Chappell, was pulled alive from the wreckage. The youngest victim was aged just 18 when she was killed. Now, nearly 80 years on from what remains the worst female loss of life in the British Army's history, the Women's Royal Corps Association is searching for relatives of those who died. The #WeWillRememberHer campaign is taking place after research showed that only around half of those who were killed are commemorated on official war memorials.  Below, bestselling author BEEZY MARSH retells the story of the tragedy, and highlights the new campaign. As the sun rose through a haze over the sea at Great Yarmouth, two dozen young women hurried back to their billets from their bracing morning exercises, to change for breakfast. Mists in May were not unusual, and although some grumbled about the dew on the grass making their shoes wet, it looked as if things would turn out nice again. Only a few months ago, they'd been strangers; women from all over the country, many of whom were barely out of their teens.  But after volunteering for the Army's Auxiliary Training Service, they'd been posted at Great Yarmouth to learn the skills they needed to work as signallers, to help the war effort. They'd come from as far afield as Scotland, Lincolnshire and North Yorkshire and the home counties, but now they'd traded civilian clothes for sea breezes, the green serge uniform and the cap badge of the ATS which they wore with pride. It was 1943; a time when the privations and losses of the Second World War were biting hard throughout Britain, but with a decisive victory for Field Marshall Montgomery in North Africa only days earlier, many had started to see a glimmer of hope.

Buried at Eye Cemetery, Ross & Cromarty Some were homesick and left their sweethearts to volunteer, others were thrilled to be away from their parents and swept up in the excitement of learning new skills.  But their training as part of the 103rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade was intense, and the girls were under no illusions. Their work was a matter of life or death for those on the frontline and mistakes would not be tolerated. Communications were vital in the war, and teleprinters received messages (signals), which were interpreted and sent on, either by teleprinter, phone or dispatch rider.  Some were in code, which had to go through the cipher office before they could be issued.  They'd be expected to work in shifts, every day, including weekends and bank holidays without complaint and wherever they were required to be, with bases in every corner of the country. By the end of the Second World War some 15,000 women were working as signallers. For the girls at Great Yarmouth, their lodgings were good by Army standards; at least they didn't have to bunk up in a freezing wooden barracks stuck in a field somewhere or dig for victory like the Land Army girls.  The Imperial Hotel on North Drive had been requisitioned at the start of the war, and parts of the grand Victorian building were used by the handsome officers of the anti-aircraft brigade. The ATS were billeted several to a room upstairs in an annexe called Whitfield House and the dining room where they usually ate breakfast was downstairs in the hotel. One of the women, Private Doris Travers, had only recently written home to her family in Northampton on her 21st birthday: 'It is not a very safe area, we are on the coast; never mind, we must put the bad with the good. My nerves are getting a bit shaky. I should like to tell you a lot but I can't. I will be coming home in six weeks' time.' But on this morning, as Private Travers and the other girls buttoned up their uniforms and smartened themselves up, something was heading towards Great Yarmouth, emerging menacingly from the mists in the skies overhead. Witnesses say they heard the unmistakable and terrifying drone of planes before they saw them. But by then it was too late.  Because of the hazy conditions, men of the Royal Observer Corps on Gorleston Cliffs only had 30 seconds to warn their HQ of an imminent attack. Flying low, almost skimming the rolls of barbed wire on the beach, came the first wave of between 15 and 20 German Focke-Wulfe fighter-bombers, in groups of three. The planes, known as the Butcher Bird or Shrike in English, were the most feared and effective of the Nazi air-force for their precision combined with the ability to carry 4,000lb bombs which they released with devastating effect.  The first explosive landed before the air raid siren had even sounded. One witness, a local man called James Dean, later reported: 'I heard the roar of planes and right in front of me, a crashing sound.  'Then there was another and I saw the building burst apart in front of me, just as five enemy planes came screaming over my head.  'The blast lifted me off the motor-roller I was driving. The planes were so low that I could see the black crosses on them.  'They seemed to lift themselves up to clear the roof tops. When I looked towards the ATS billet, I saw the awful wreckage.' The whole of the Whitfield House annexe had been reduced to rubble.  Twenty-six fine young women who had been prepared to fight for King and Country against the Nazis, were killed instantly. But the carnage did not stop there.  The bombers rounded and dropped a further 13 bombs on the town, indiscriminately killing civilians as well as service personnel. In all, a total of 49 servicemen and women and civilians were killed or later died of their wounds. A rescue operation began almost immediately, with helpers scrabbling through the rubble with their bare hands to find any survivors.  But only one, 22-year-old Private Doreen Chappell from Gloucestershire was pulled alive from the wreckage.  The youngest ATS victim, Lilian Grimmer, of Norfolk, was just 18 when she perished that day, with 25 of her fellow ATS volunteers.  She was supposed to be on leave but swapped with another girl to let her go home for her 21st birthday. The majority of the ATS girls who died were aged in their very early twenties and the eldest was 32. One girl, private Ivy Moore, of Grimsby, Yorkshire, had been due to announce her engagement. Rescue workers including personnel from the Sherwood Foresters, refused to give up the search, clawing through the debris and eventually accepting that no survivors would be found. Their efforts were reported in the local press. One said: 'We were ordered to dig in the rubble and get the mutilated bodies out, so we clambered in and started work. There were bodies, arms and legs and torsos, all separate. The dead bodies were laid on the tennis court.' Even at a time of war, when so many had suffered loss, the death of so many young women in an attack in broad daylight sent shockwaves through the nation.  Most of the women's remains were returned to their hometowns for burial. However, eight were interred within the borough; six in Great Yarmouth Cemetery, also known as Caister, and two in the local Roman Catholic Cemetery. Full military honours were accorded to them. Their coffins, draped with Union Jacks, were carried in a sombre procession to the communal grave on the shoulders of men of the Anti-Aircraft Command.  Bugles sounded the last post as the coffins were lowered into the grave. The Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) was the women's branch of the British Army during the Second World War.  Formed in 1938, it had its roots in the Women's Axiliary Army Corps, which was formed during the First World War as a voluntary service.  From 1941 onwards, the ATS was granted full military status, but the women who served in it were not allowed to take on combat roles.  After female conscription began in December 1941, all women who entered the Army went into the ATS, apart from nurses.  Roles were initially restricted to cooks, clerks, orderlies, storekeepers and drivers but the jobs that were available became more varied as demand for personnel increased.  By 1943, there were 56,000 women serving with anti-aircraft units, although they were still banned from firing guns.  Famous ATS women included King George VI's eldest daughter, the then Princess Elizabeth, along with Mary Churchill, the daughter of Prime Minister Winston.   By the end of the Second World War, around 250,000 women had served in the ATS.   For the sole survivor, Private Doreen Chappell, the emotional and physical consquences of that dreadful morning were to last a lifetime. In the immediate aftermath, she did not realise that she was the only one to make it out alive - a fact which her bosses attributed to her dislike of being inside during air-raids, which may have lead her to avoid some of the falling masonry which killed her friends.  Lying in a hospital bed, swathed in bandages, she joked: 'Trust me to be the only one to finish up in here!' But for the next three years, she was in and out of hospital for mental and physical consequences of the air raid and was invalided out of the force. Doreen went on to marry an officer she'd met in Great Yarmouth when he was in the Navy, manning a motor torpedo boat. She died in Wales in 1989. Now, nearly 80 years on from what remains the worst disaster in terms of female losses to the British Army, the Women's Royal Army Corps Association - which is the only charity to specifically support women who served - is searching for relatives of those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country that day.  The #WeWillRememberHer campaign aims to ensure their loss is not forgotten after research revealed only around half of those who died are commemorated on official war memorials. The charity is determined to put this right. Paula Rogers, Chief Executive of the WRAC Association, says: 'Recent studies have confirmed what the WRAC Association has known for some time - women often do not see themselves as veterans.  'This is exacerbated by the lack of recognition on our memorials across the UK, and at Remembrance services where women attending are often assumed to be the wives and widows of ex-servicemen rather than someone who served her country.  'We have only found around half these 26 women on war graves so far.' Retired Brigadier Fiona Gardner, the charity's vice-president, adds: 'Year on year, our members have been attending the Great Yarmouth site where these women were killed to pay their respect and honour their sacrifice but we want to go further.  'The WRAC Association is committed to ensuring these women women are remembered on their local war memorials.' A new plaque will be unveiled at the site where the tragedy struck, at 2pm on Sunday May 15th, at The Imperial Hotel in Great Yarmouth. Some family members did contact the WRAC Association over the years, to record what memories they could of their loved ones. A cousin of Private Vera Mann wrote: 'Vera was an only child and she and I were great friends. She was happy with her life in the ATS and she came to see me on her last leave just before Christmas 1942.' The family of Lance Corporal Anna MacLeod of Stornaway, wrote: 'Anna's death was a shattering blow to us all. Anna was just about to be commissioned and had a promising career in front of her.' The relatives of Private Ivy Moore of Grimbsy placed flowers on her grave every year and the Grimsby branch of the WRAC Association held a church service for the three ATS girls buried there. It took almost 50 years before the tragedy was commemorated in a fitting way, thanks to another WW2 veteran, Joan Awbery, 101, from Cambridgeshire who enlisted in the ATS in 1942 and ended the war as an officer working in Brussels in the Legal Aid section. In 1994, thanks to her determination, she co-ordinated the unveiling of a plaque, with Lady Soames, the youngest daughter of Winston Churchill, having traced some relatives of the women.  Sadly, many had already died. Now the plaque, which had been damaged in an accident, has been mended and is to be rededicated in a ceremony on May 15th at the site of the tragedy. As Ms Awbery explains: 'Given the tender age of these women, we know grandchildren won't be found but the WRAC Association hopes to identify great nephews, nieces, cousins and so forth to tell them of the part their brave relative played in military history.' More than 345,000 women served in the ATS from 1938 to 1949 and many women and their families emigrated to the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand as well as those who returned to Barbados and Jamaica.

    "b22ab911bba39304ff420d1df252ea5ed5716c193c1bdfb10f55d49b": "Council chiefs in one of the UK's most-visited medieval cities are cracking down on ugly shopfront designs which they say 'harm' its rich heritage. Local authority leaders in Canterbury, Kent are set to launch investigations into stores using non-traditional materials and oversized signage deemed to be out-of-keeping with the cathedral city's historic landmarks. Canterbury City Council (CCC) claims a number of shops have got away with overbearing decor in recent years. Shops which are considered to be out-of-keeping with the city's medieval aesthetic include Northgate Newsagents - which is painted bright yellow, Nationwide building society with its red-and-blue exterior, and stationery store The Works - which is renown for its vivid yellow and blue bubble font.  This has prompted the authority to place greater emphasis on ensuring conservation guidelines are obeyed. CCC leader Ben Fitter-Harding said: 'The city centre is a conservation area and shops are supposed to get consent for anything that would be different to the general standard. 'There are a lot of examples on the high street of various shop-fronts which have changed quite a lot over the years and are not really sympathetic to our heritage. 'It can be quite a lot of work to assess those and whether they are in breach of policies,' he told KentOnline. Mr Fitter-Harding explained the council has invested between PS100,000 and PS200,000 in more enforcement staff and lawyers to ensure its conservation policies are adhered to. He added: 'We have a bigger legal team to deal with these sorts of problems and to essentially make sure policies are enforced. 'We all want the city to be beautiful and prosperous. 'And we're aware of our Unesco World Heritage Status which needs protecting, so we need to make sure the high street is sympathetic towards that. 'We're not going to be doing a blanket review of every shopfront. But people do make reports about unsympathetic shop-fronts, so we will be making sure they are properly scrutinised and the correct enforcement action is taken..' The council has drawn up a 300-page long conservation area appraisal and management plan considering how the aesthetics of the popular tourist city can be improved over the next few years. There are currently no plans to introduce new planning policies but the authority plans to follow the management guide when considering planning applications. The CCC report reads: 'Certain shop-fronts have been inappropriately altered over the years and others have been entirely replaced. 'This incremental change has a negative impact on the special interest of the conservation area. 'Raising an awareness among shop owners about the importance of retaining historic shop-fronts and about the appropriate design of replacement features would be beneficial. 'Opportunities should be taken to restore more traditional shop-front designs, reinstating historic features and installing sensitively designed signage.'",
    "1b23ed9fa651b24ecbd29240a68c7eb14f48f829c981b67c0ac9e3d1": "An 'overzealous' female Sandhurst instructor kicked a trainee officer and yelled 'get a grip' at him when he kept making mistakes during basic training, a court martial has heard.  Captain Ruth Cork, 35, lost her temper during a field exercise, then stood over the kneeling officer cadet and 'steadied herself' before booting him, Bulford Military Court was told. The decorated Army officer became increasingly frustrated with the cadet and was seen 'pacing up and down' and shouting 'come on' at him before 'boiling over' at the Royal Military Academy, in Sandhurst, Berkshire. Officer Cadet Charles MacAllister said he did not report the assault as he 'thought it was part of being in the Army'. But captain Cork - whose recruits fell out with her over her management - claimed it was an 'overzealous attempt of reinforcing training'. She admitted ill treatment of a subordinate on the first day of her trial and was fined PS600. She plans to leave the Army next month to become a project manager at a company closely associated with the force. On March 30 last year, captain Cork was leading a field exercise on attacking and reconnaissance for recruits 12 weeks into their training. Mr MacAllister was acting as platoon commander during the exercise - but repeatedly made mistakes as he was supposed to be delivering messages over a radio. He 'was on both knees and looked to her for guidance' but 'the more things he got wrong, the angrier captain Cork got', the court was told. Captain Cork grew 'frustrated', was 'pacing up and down', told him 'come on', then deliberately kicked him and told him to 'get a grip'. At Bulford Military Court, Wiltshire, prosecutor Commander Peter Barker said: 'OC MacAllister made mistakes and they were repeated. 'Captain Cork was shouting at him and there came a time where she steadied herself and threw a kick at his left side as she was standing over him. 'Witnesses describe seeing the cadet wobble and described being shocked and angry at what happened but nobody raised it at that time. 'Captain Cork did not apologise.' A welfare officer later reported the incident and captain Cork told investigators she could not remember kicking him. The court heard cadets 'took exception to her style of management and relations were strained'. Barrister Matthew Simpson, defending, said captain Cork is now 'remorseful' and that it was a 'moment of madness'. Mr Simpson said the violent act was 'minor' as Mr MacAllister had no injuries and claimed the Covid-19 pandemic and a family tragedy meant captain Cork was under stress at the time. Mr Simpson said: 'As an instructor captain Cork accepts the severity of what she pleaded to but balancing that out... it was short-lived, out of character, a moment of madness.' He claimed it was 'in no way the most serious case', adding: 'This was a one-off, of a relatively minor nature, and an overzealous attempt to reinforce training.' Captain Cork, who has more than 10 years service, remained stony-faced as Assistant Judge Advocate General Darren Reed fined her PS600. Judge Reed said: 'Instructing trainees in basic training is a difficult and testing role... It requires a level of robustness that cannot be found in the civilian world. 'However, those being put through that environment deserve respect and dignity. 'You grew frustrated with your officer cadet and allowed your frustration to boil over into a single act of violence. 'There was no need to lay hands on him let alone kick him. 'This was an abuse of position and you only felt you could do this was because of the position you were filling.' Captain Cork was said to have had a 'glittering' career with service medals from Iraq, and Syria, as well as the Queen's Jubilee Medal. The court martial heard captain Cork is 'essential' and 'held at the highest regard' at the world-famous Royal Military Academy which oversees the training of Army officers and is where Prince William and Harry attended.  The court was given extensive character references from senior Sandhurst officers as captain Cork pleaded not to be dismissed from the force. Lieutenant Colonel Nicholas Morton MBE, commanding officer at Sandhurst's New College, said: 'I'm unequivocal in stating that in the period of time I have known and worked with captain Cork she has been an outstanding member of staff. 'She has been a role model for officer cadets - in particular female officer cadets - in setting an example. 'Captain Cork has been and remains essential to the delivery of [training]... Her continued presence is critical to the New College.' Colonel Matt Quare MBE said: 'She is an exemplar model in preparing the next generation of leaders.' Other soldiers described her as 'intelligent', 'well-rounded', and 'the best platoon commander I've worked with'. The court was told captain Cork has one previous offence of drink driving from 2004.",
    "5932afd9f01514ec2733367e8cb8418f4c067494563679c6afe32119": "Children have suffered sexual abuse, assaults and neglect during after-school clubs with more than 80 allegations made in the last five years, an investigation has revealed. Only one in ten providers are investigated by Ofsted, meaning they could go almost a decade without an inspection, while some of the clubs are not regulated at all as they only need to register with Ofsted if they provide childcare for more than two hours.          Responses to Freedom of Information requests sent by BBC News revealed there were 84 safeguarding referrals at after-school clubs in England and Wales over the past five years. These included an incident in which an eight-year-old boy had to clean his younger sister after she soiled herself at a school in north London, sexual abuse involving multiple children at a club in Devon, and a child being dragged across the floor by a staff member in Southampton. Other incidents included allegations of physical harm, unexplained bruising and neglect. The mother of the boy who was forced to clean his five-year-old sister, said he had to do so in front of other pupils at Greenleaf After School Club in Walthamstow, north London, having previously cleaned her after she wet herself on two occasions before. Greenleaf Primary School, which runs the club, apologised, saying the 'incident should not have happened'. Speaking to BBC News, the mother of the children said a staff member refused to clean her daughter, who has special educational needs, and told her brother to do it instead, in November 2020. The mother claimed the five-year-old girl was left with excrement on her leg and had no tights or knickers when she was picked up in freezing conditions.  She accused the school of 'racism', as both children are black, and also 'adultification' - a bias in which children of minority groups are considered older than they are.  The mother said: 'I don't allow my child to see his sister's genitals, how on earth do they think that is acceptable? They would never possibly ask a white child to do that.' The incident was reviewed by an independent safeguarding consultant - who told the mother it was 'unacceptable' - and investigated by the local authority. BBC News found another child was found with excrement on their hands having been left in a chair for an hour after soiling themselves at the same after-school club. Greenleaf Primary School said: 'We have apologised unreservedly to the parent of the children involved and more widely to all users of the Greenleaf After School Club. 'This incident should not have happened, and we are determined to learn the lessons as we continue to provide our young people with the best start in life. 'Greenleaf Primary is a school that prides itself on treating children from all backgrounds equally.' Despite the school saying staff had been removed from dealing with the siblings, their mother said she saw one in direct contact with her son when she went to collect them having taken them back after the earlier incidents. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: 'Every child should feel safe in education, including at after-school clubs. 'That's why local agencies can use a range of legislative powers - including safeguarding, health and safety, and premises regulations powers - to protect children from harm.'",
    "e360209b940ce662698ea6952158056744928aa6aaed840a60323856": "A pensioner is almost PS4,000 out of pocket after being refused boarding on an 11-day cruise because his NHS Scotland Covid app suddenly stopped working.  Malcolm Walker, 75, from Fife, Scotland, had travelled down to Southampton with his wife on April 18, hoping to enjoy their much-anticipated trip to Portugal, Spain and Gibraltar.  But the furious Scotsman was left 'astounded' when the NHS Scotland Covid Status app underwent a 'security update' without warning, meaning he could not access his vaccination status proving him and his wife had been triple jabbed. He claims staff refused to let them board and said he is around PS3,800 out of pocket for the cruise, insurance, travel to and from Southampton, hotels, and parking. Mr Walker, who is demanding an apology from the Scottish government, said the app had been working the day before they were due to set sail. He said: 'Two days before and the day before I checked the Covid 19 status on my mobile phone and all was well until we reached Southampton. 'The verification level on my iPhone 6 was level 11.4, my wife's 12.1. 'On the day of departure, NHS Scotland increased the verification level to 13.1. 'As our phones are older with the information permanently stored, we had no need for the user name or password, and there was no prior warning - we were completely unaware of anything amiss. 'Preparing to board, we were astounded to find that we could not access the app, so we were denied access to the cruise.' Earlier in the year Mr Walker said he had tried to obtain paper copies of their vaccination status without success. He said he was told they could not give him the information because they did not have his wife's email address. Malcolm said he got no reply from the helpline number, but was able to access the app - and assumed it would work for the cruise. He added: 'This affair has cost me a lot of money. 'We have been in touch with our insurance company, but feel it is unfair for them to recompense us when the fault lies with the Scotland's NHS department and government... I would like an apology. 'This happened because they did not inform people of their intentions, but upgraded, and altered the app without thought or consideration as to the possible consequences.' A Scottish Government spokesperson said: 'We are sorry to hear of Mr Walker's experience. 'In common with all apps available on the iStore, the NHS Scotland Covid Status App is only available on phones which receive vital security updates and works on all Apple phones released since 2015, providing the user has updated the operating system to at least iOS 13.1. 'A recent routine security update required by Apple removed unsupported operating systems from being able to support the app. 'Anyone unable to use the app can get a paper copy of their vaccination certificate online or via the Covid Status Helpline on 0808 196 8565.' Mr Walker would have been required to prove he was fully vaccinated due to Portugal and Spain's Covid travel restrictions.  The Spanish tourist board in London spectacularly U-turned on April 7 after it had announced a day earlier that the country would open up to unvaccinated British holidaymakers.  The board had declared Spain would open up to all UK travellers - including the unvaccinated - with no restrictions, provided passengers could provide a negative pre-departure test. But in a matter of hours the decision was reversed, with the board's deputy director labelling the erroneous announcement a 'miscommunication' which arose from a 'misinterpretation of the rules' laid out in a Spanish health department bulletin. Much to the frustration of thousands of eager holidaymakers, UK travellers aged 12 and above are still required to show proof of being fully vaccinated - or a certificate of recovery obtained than 180 days from the date of travel - to get into the country.  The only exception to this rule applies to those aged 12-17, who are able to get into the country unvaccinated provided they have proof of a negative, approved PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival. Deputy director of the Spanish tourist board in the UK Pedro Medina said in a statement: 'We apologise unreservedly for the miscommunication earlier today which was due to a misunderstanding of the new entry requirements.'   The tourist office also said: 'If more than 270 days have passed since the final dose, certification of a booster vaccination is also required, except for teenagers aged 12 to 17 inclusive.' Furthermore, travellers looking to gain entry to Spain via a certificate of recovery must have a document obtained from 'the official authorities' in connection with a test 'carried out by qualified personnel'. This means that a self-testing kit is not valid, and travellers aiming to show proof of recovery must have a certificate from a test administered by an EU-approved list of providers. ",
    "a8219ed236764ecd728ed438bc32a1c8e52b943e4018eef00c95a60b": "A cancer patient died after a scan result showing he needed urgent treatment on a blood clot was left on a consultant's desk for six days, an inquest has heard.  Trevor Reynolds would have lived for longer had the results of his CT scan been seen and his treatment for the fatal clot started sooner in May last year. Instead, the paperwork was left on the desk of consultant oncologist Dr Angel Garcia Alonso on a Thursday, who only saw it six days later after coming back from annual leave. It was only seen at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd hospital in Bodelwyddan, North Wales, when Dr Alonso returned the following Wednesday.  An inquest has concluded the 78-year-old, who was being treated for oesophagus cancer at the hospital, would have lived had his treatment not been delayed.  Giving evidence to John Gittins, the coroner for North Wales East and Central, Dr Alonso said he felt the delay had contributed to Mr Reynold's death. Dr Alonso said: 'Had I seen it, I would have alerted the GP and the patient and got the patient in and on anticoagulation as soon as possible. When asked by the coroner if the delay had been a disadvantage in the likely success of treatment, he said: 'Yes, it has played a part in the outcome.' Mr Reynolds was undergoing cancer treatment when he had the scan showing he need urgently treatment on the blood clot in May last year. On May 6 the radiologist placed the results on Dr Alonso's desk - but he was out of office for another six days. Dr Alonso said he was off-site the next day, then on leave. Upon his return and the notes being read, Mr Reynolds was immediately placed on a course of treatment but he died on 15 May from the pulmonary emboli and pneumonia. Hospital administration manager Ellen Ruth Davies said that since Mr Reynolds' death changes in the procedure for passing on urgent results were now more 'robust'. These include making sure other senior clinicians can be contacted if a consultant is not available to be made aware of urgent cases. Coroner for North Wales East and Central John Gittins recorded a narrative conclusion at the Ruthin inquest. He will now raise a prevention of 'future deaths report' in the hope of preventing another tragedy. He said: 'The evidence indicated that had treatment for the clot began sooner there would have been a better prospect of it being successful and further that the treatment of his cancer had been effective. 'On the balance of probabilities therefore it is likely that Mr Reynolds would not have died on the 15th of May 2021 if the result of his scan had been acted upon when reported by the radiologist on the 6th of May.' The inquest heard he had died as a result of both the clot known as a pulmonary emboli and a pneumonia. Mr Gittins said he was 'disappointed' these changes had not been formally adopted until December - seven months after Mr Reynolds' death - and was 'dumbfounded' to hear the new system was only now being audited too see whether the new changes were working. He said he hoped Betsi Cadwaladr health board could explain in greater detail what it was doing and what it had learnt from 'this awful event'. Mr Gittins said the evidence indicated that, had treatment for the clot began sooner, there would have been a better prospect of it being successful. On the balance of probabilities, he added it was likely that Mr Reynolds would not have died on 15 May 2021 had his scan had been acted upon when reported. Outside the court, Mr Reynolds' widow Maureen, of Abergele, North Wales said: 'I am still distressed and I'll never get over it. 'I just hope now that they will get something done and other people won't have to go through what me and my family has gone through. It's horrible.'",
    "5a3a9dbe2cf598b65f3fdfc3a9245655b57fca78d3821ecd12aa1a4f": "Tim Westwood's bosses at Capital FM and sister stations LBC and Classic FM tried to stop listeners hearing that one of their star DJs was accused of sexual misconduct, it was claimed today. The 64-year-old son of the former Bishop of Peterborough has been accused of groping the bottoms and breasts of black women at gigs or initiating unwanted sex with others. Global, which owns Capital and other stations, had already faced criticism after it refused to probe the star when claims first surfaced online two years ago.  And today The Guardian claimed management told its journalists to avoid reporting the allegations. Staff in Global's newsroom told the newspaper they had been asked to avoid mentioning the allegations, revealed in a BBC3 documentary: Tim Westwood: Abuse of Power. The company declined to comment.  Westwood was forced to step down from Capital Xtra last week in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations. The bishop's son, 64, parted ways with the station 'until further notice' after seven women accused him of predatory sexual behaviour. Labour MP Jess Phillips said at the time: 'Surely an investigation of allegations is the least that should be done. 'Organisations should have systems in place to investigate complaints against their staff.' Pamela was 20 when she says Westwood invited her for work experience at Radio 1 after meeting her through her job in the music industry. She claims he told her he wanted to learn how to 'get a younger audience', and reassured her 'stern Jamaican mother' that she would be safe to travel to London from the Midlands. However, when he picked her up from the railway station in his car he started 'stroking her leg and touching her face', Pamela* claims. Westwood allegedly took her to his flat where he began trying to kiss her neck and remove her clothing. She says she thought: 'I'm in London alone with this man. Now if I try and get out of this, who's to say how he's going to react... so I just submitted to it.' She said the ordeal in 2000 was 'traumatic' and 'disgusting'. The promised work experience never materialised. Pamela hit out at the BBC for allowing Westwood to abuse his 'celebrity status', adding: 'Who are they going to believe? This little girl from the Midlands, or this big, shiny star from London?' * Names have been changed to protect identities But it bowed to pressure following a joint investigation by the Guardian and the BBC. Global said in a statement: 'Following the claims that have recently come to light, Tim Westwood has stepped down from his show until further notice.' Westwood was also removed from two of the bank holiday weekend events that he had been due to appear at. Three women have accused the hiphop DJ of opportunistic and predatory sexual behaviour while four others allege he groped them at events. Most of these are alleged to have taken place when he worked at the BBC, although its director general said no complaints were made to the Corporation at the time. Two women say they agreed to come to London to meet the DJ to discuss music as they were hoping to work in the industry. They accuse Westwood of picking them up from the train station in his car and driving them to his flat, where he forced himself on them. Westwood strongly denies the claims. It is understood none of the women made formal complaints and there is no known current police investigation into the star. Westwood joined Capital Xtra in 2014 after losing his job at BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra where he had worked from 1994 to 2013.  BBC director general Tim Davie described the testimony of the women as 'powerful and appalling'. He called for anyone else with evidence to come forward but said he had seen 'no evidence of complaints' during Westwood's time at the corporation. 'I've asked and we looked at our records and we've seen no evidence,' said Davie. 'I do think now we're in a position where we're very clear on culture, which is every complaint has to be taken seriously. 'If something like this were raised or anything comes up, we investigate it fully. And I would hope we were doing that in that time as well. 'I would simply say if people have evidence where things weren't followed up, or they have concern in this area, bring it to us. We want to investigate it.' All seven alleged victims were black and aged in their late teens to early 20s at the time of the alleged incidents between 1992 and 2017. They came forward after anonymous allegations of inappropriate behaviour about Westwood started circulating on social media in June 2020. The DJ denied any wrongdoing at the time. Students have accused Westwood of inappropriate behaviour when he performs at university Freshers' events. He was heard shouting out to fans at one: 'Girl in the front row with the black dress on, I will be f****** you later.' He told another girl: 'Security have told me you need to wear a sports bra.' Despite the claims he has continued to tour universities and even performed at Norwich freshers' week last autumn. Westwood was due to appear at a number of events over the next month but the listings have disappeared from his website. An appearance at the Empire in Bedford, which was due to take place on April 29, was scrapped and a statement from his management shared on Instagram says: 'In light of the allegations, this event has been cancelled. 'Tim Westwood denies all allegations of wrongdoing. Apologies for inconvenience this may cause to your bank holiday weekend.' A spokesman for Westwood said he 'strongly denies all allegations of inappropriate behaviour', adding: 'In a career that has spanned 40 years, there have never been any complaints made against him officially or unofficially. Tim Westwood strongly rejects all allegations of wrongdoing.'",
    "7d367b11f61df290fc6a1a4b30a2e0923e6a63ef4e3c635f184df897": "Ministers have quietly dropped plans for a new law forcing bosses to let staff keep all of their tips from customers. New plans were announced in September that would make it illegal for businesses to siphon off gratuity money given to workers by customers using debit and credit cards.  At the time it was said the move could benefit approximately two million hospitality workers, who often rely on tips to help boost minimum wage salaries.  But sources confirmed today that a Government bill was now unlikely - though ministers could support a private members bill on the issue, if one is brought forward by an MP. It comes six years after the idea was first raised by then business minister Sajid Javid.  Labour's Angela Rayner said: 'Another broken promise by Boris Johnson's Conservatives - snuck out hoping you won't notice.  'He's allowing tips to be pinched from under the noses of staff in bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants. You can't trust the Tories with your rights at work.' Research has shown businesses that operate with an optional service charge for parties or gatherings often keep part of all of said charges instead of divvying them up among staff. Under the plans mooted last year, front of house staff would be protected with the potential for employment tribunal and data requests over how their bosses were sharing tips. Restaurant owners are already banned from keeping cash tips left for waiting staff, but there is nothing to stop them taking a cut when the bill is settled by debit or credit card, which has become increasingly popular as cash use was discouraged in the pandemic. Union chiefs wrote to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng last year, warning that the fall in cash payments and employers 'interfering' with tips has created a 'perfect storm' that has wiped out recent rises in the Living Wage and Minimum Wage.   At the time, Paul Scully, the Government's labour markets minister, told the Times: 'Unfortunately, some companies choose to withhold cash from hardworking staff who have been tipped by customers as a reward for good service. 'Our plans will make this illegal and ensure tips will go to those who worked for it. 'This will provide a boost to workers in pubs, cafes and restaurants across the country, while reassuring customers their money is going to those who deserve it.' Trade union leaders reacted with fury today to the law being shelved today, with Unite boss Sharon Graham telling the FT: 'Every year this government promises action to ensure fair tipping, and then does precisely nothing to deliver on that promise.'",
    "0cb36fc29e06dad4d42e87811efb92622c3c3d356eb68dd03958f0db": "A rare 'Jolly Roger' flag displayed on a Royal Navy submarine which hunted Nazi ships is on sale for PS10,000. HMS Unbroken sank 14 German merchant boats and two warships in the Mediterranean during World War Two. Each new victory was marked on the U-class submarine's 43in by 45in flag, which carries the traditional skull and crossbones. Its stars and cannon represent four merchant vessels sunk with the deck gun, while the daggers signify 'cloak and dagger operations'.  White and red bars along the flag's right-hand side refer to vanquished merchant and war ships. The flag was taken from the submarine by Petty Officer Frederick Sharp who served on board HMS Unbroken.  It has passed down the generations and is now being sold by his grandson with Duke's Auctions, of Dorchester, Dorset. The flag had been tucked away in a loft of a Weymouth property so they would like it go on display in a museum. It is being sold alongside previously unpublished photos of the submarine's crew. Julian Smith, specialist at Duke's, said: 'HMS Unbroken was a real thorn in the side of the enemy and they displayed the flag when returning to base to celebrate their victories. 'It is extremely rare for a Jolly Roger flag to emerge for sale and it is a great piece of history. 'The flag has come directly from the family who had it in a loft and they think its history should be appreciated, perhaps in a museum.' The custom of Royal Navy submarines having their own Jolly Roger dates back to the First World War after a comment made by First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson. He complained that submarine warfare was 'underhanded, unfair, and damned un-English' and that crews were pirates. After that, submarine crews kept a Jolly Roger and updated them with different sewn-on emblems to mark their victories. HMS Unbroken transported SOE officer Captain Peter Churchill and three colleagues to the Bay of Antibes in April 1941 to meet French resistance leader Francois d'Astier de La Vigerie. As part of the 10th Flotilla, the vessel spent much of the war in the Mediterranean operating out of Malta, sabotaging the Italian war effort. It badly damaged the Italian light cruiser Muzio Attendolo and the heavy cruiser Bolzano. Unbroken was loaned to the Soviet Navy in June 1944 and returned in 1949. It was scraped a year later. The sale takes place on May 14.",

Commander Mike Norman, second in command of HMS Sheffield, said it would be 'terrible' if the French had withheld information that could have saved British lives.  Exocet anti-ship missiles allegedly contained technology to disarm them - but French president Francois Mitterrand denied any such feature existed. It is not clear how the technology worked, but it is known that arms manufacturers sometimes secretly built disabling 'switches' into weapons so they could be prevented from doing damage if they fell into the hands of a hostile state.  Three Royal Navy ships were hit by Exocets during the war with sailors on all three dying. Two ships, the HMS Sheffield and the merchant vessel Atlantic Conveyor, sank.  Yesterday marked the 40th anniversary of the HMS Sheffield attack, which killed 20 sailors in the first British fatalities of the conflict.  Commander Norman told the Telegraph: 'If it was true and they didn't tell us how we could disarm them, I think it would be terrible, frankly. 'That was the one single weapon the Task Force was really worried about.'  Members of Margaret Thatcher's government have also come out in favour of an inquiry, with Lord Tebbit appealing to the French to 'explain themselves'.  Former energy minister David Mellor also asked the French to reveal the truth but predicted:  'I'm totally and utterly confident that there is no reason why they would feel any particular concern for us, no reason why they would tell us the truth and no reason they wouldn't brazen it out in a very Gallic way.' Arms manufacturers sometimes secretly build kill switches into weapons so they can be disabled if acquired by a hostile state.  British officials suspected that France did not want to admit they had been installed on Exocets because it could deter possible buyers.  MPs want to know what the French government did or did not share with Mrs Thatcher and her Cabinet - and whether the missiles could have been remotely deactivated.  Tobias Ellwood, chairman of Parliament's defence select committee, said the issue 'warrants further investigation' while former defence secretary Liam Fox said France should be 'open and honest' about what happened in the 1982 war.  British officials appealed to its long-term military ally for information about how the Exocet missiles worked and whether they could be disabled as a Royal Navy task force sailed to retake the islands from Argentina.  Experts in the UK thought that the missiles contained a kill switch partly through examining earlier versions bought by the Army.  The maker of the weapons, French company Aerospatiale, denied the kill switches existed. Mr Ellwood said: 'We don't know the wider decision-making that surrounded this. Indeed, those responsible might not even be alive today. 'As we look to future battles we must learn from past events, and that includes how we work with allies and how we share critical intelligence. 'It certainly would have been game-changing had France chosen to share this characteristic of the Exocet.'      By Harry Howard, History Correspondent for MailOnline  A claim that Margaret Thatcher threatened to launch a nuclear attack on Buenos Aires unless France handed over information to disable Argentina's Exocet missiles in the Falklands War has resurfaced on the 40th anniversary of the sinking of HMS Sheffield.  The Royal Navy ship sank six days after being hit by one of the French-made guided missiles on May 4, 1982, leading to the deaths of 20 crew members. A further 26 servicemen suffered injuries, including burns.  The attack was the first British loss of life in the Falklands War, which took place after Argentine forces invaded the Falklands Islands, on the orders of dictatorial leader General Leopoldo Galtieri.  According to a 2005 book by psychoanalyst Ali Magoudi, who met regularly with the French leader from 1982 to 1984, France's then president Francois Mitterrand was approached by Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for information that could disable the missiles.   Mrs Thatcher was then said to have threatened to fire a nuclear warhead at Argentina's capital unless the information was handed over. Magoudi's claim was reported again by The Telegraph today.  It comes after senior MPs last night called for an inquiry into whether France lied about the existence of a 'kill switch' in the Exocet missiles used by Argentina. In total, the weapons hit three Royal Navy ships, killing 46 sailors.  The missiles allegedly contained technology to disarm them, but Mitterrand denied the feature existed.  It is not clear how the technology worked, but it is known that arms manufacturers sometimes secretly built disabling 'switches' into weapons so they could be prevented from doing damage if they fell into the hands of a hostile state.  Today, a memorial paying tribute to the sailors killed in the attack on HMS Sheffield is to be unveiled at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.  The sinking of the Sheffield was revenge for Britain's attack on the Argentine cruiser the General Belgrano two days earlier, which killed 323 sailors. According to Magoudi's book, which is titled RendezVous - the pschyoanalysis of Francois Mitterrand, Mrs Thatcher demanded to her French counterpart that he hand over codes that could disable the Exocet missiles.  Mitterrand is quoted as saying: 'Happily, I gave in. Otherwise, I assure you, that lady's iron finger would have pushed the button.' Mrs Thatcher was said to be 'furious' that France had sold its advanced weapons to the Argentinian regime.  They became the Royal Navy's most feared threat and were also used to sink the supply ship the Atlantic Conveyor, killing a further 12 sailors.  Another 14 sailors died when the HMS Glamorgan was struck. The ship was repaired and remained in service until 1984.    Magoudi, who was one of Mitterrand's closest confidantes, said that, having allegedly agreed to the information request, the French president was then determined to get his revenge on 'those English upstarts'. 'I will destroy their beloved island by linking it with Europe,' he is alleged to have said.  'Despite their inbred desire for isolation, I will make Britain join Europe by building a tunnel under the Channel.' France did eventually pass information on the Exocet to Britain in 1982 which helped the navy to defend itself against further attack in the Falklands War.  However, last night MPs called for an inquiry into what the French government did or did not share with Mrs Thatcher, and whether or not the missiles could have been remotely deactivated.  Tobias Ellwood, who is chairman of Parliament's defence select committee, said the issue needs 'further investigation'.  Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox added that France should be 'open and honest' about what happened.  Experts in the UK believed the missiles contained a kill switch partly through examining earlier versions that had been bought by the Army.  French company Aerospatiale, which made the weapons, insisted that kill switches did not exist.   Mr Ellwood said: 'We don't know the wider decision-making that surrounded this. Indeed, those responsible might not even be alive today. 'As we look to future battles we must learn from past events, and that includes how we work with allies and how we share critical intelligence. 'It certainly would have been game-changing had France chosen to share this characteristic of the Exocet.' The HMS Sheffield was the first British warship to have been lost since the Second World War.   The ship was hit on its starboard side, ripping a hole 15ft long and 4ft high - and instantly killing eight cooks and setting it on fire, which lasted for two days. Twelve crew members were thought to be killed by fumes and several were seriously burned.  Six days after it was attacked, the ship sank while being towed back to the shore. Speaking on the BBC today, survivor Andy Stevenson spoke of the moment the Sheffield was hit. 'If you imagine a missile you are expecting a bang. No bang at all. It was like a massive blast of air that blew me out my bunk,' he said.  During the Falklands War, Royal Navy ships carrying WE.177 nuclear bombs were assigned to the task force that sailed to the islands to fight Argentine forces.  In 2003, the Government admitted that British ships were carrying nuclear weapons, but insisted there was never any intention to use them in the conflict.",
    "0ff0549e0d71734f1d6463df1476cdb006787502e5544f3cf1b95797": "A jobless painter who murdered his 83-year-old Baronet stepfather was set to inherit part of his PS34million fortune, it has been revealed.  Thomas Schreiber, 35, stabbed Sir Richard Sutton to death at his PS2million country home in Dorset during a murderous spree on April 7 last year.  He had been living there rent free, along with his mother Anne, 66, who he also tried to kill in a frenzied stabbing attack, leaving her paralysed from the neck down.  A heated row in November 2020 over the inheritance of a chandelier - in which Sir Richard hit Schreiber with a walking stick - was said to have acted as a catalyst which sparked Schreiber's killer motives.  At trial at Winchester Crown Court, the jury heard how he began to scour the internet for articles about revenge after becoming 'consumed with hatred' following the argument.  It came after Sir Richard had reportedly given Schreiber a PS1,000 monthly allowance and offered him a PS100,000 deposit for a house.  Now, a little over a year after the killing, unearthed legal documents show the ungrateful killer was also named as a beneficiary in his victim's will.  But the Forfeiture Act 1982 - which prohibits people from benefiting from their crimes - means he will get nothing.  Sir Richard Lexington Sutton, 83, was estimated to be worth PS301million in 2020 and owns around 7,000 acres of land across the UK.  He is a baronet, a hereditary honour awarded by the monarch. It is the lowest-ranking hereditary title, but baronets are able to use the prefix 'sir'. The Sutton Baronetcy of Norwood Park in the County of Nottingham, dates back to October 1772. It was created by King George III for politician Richard Sutton. He was the second surviving son of the distinguished diplomat Sir Robert Sutton.  The latter was the grandson of Henry Sutton, brother of Robert Sutton, 1st Baron Lexinton. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the family seat was at Benham Place. However, the house was sold in 1982. Sir Richard became the ninth baronet of Norwood Park, Nottingham, in 1981, after inheriting the title from his father.  Sir Richard was listed at number 435 in The Sunday Times Rich List in 2020 with an estimated family fortune of PS301 million - a rise of PS83 million on the previous year.  He owned the Sheraton Grand on London's prestigious Park Lane and the Athenaeum in Piccadilly, in addition to other hotels in Bath, Cheltenham and Windsor, and land in Dorset, Berkshire, London, Lincolnshire and Aberdeenshire, and several farming and property businesses. His landholdings include the Benham Estate in West Berkshire and the Stainton Estate in Lincolnshire.  Details of Sir Richard's estate, published yesterday, showed he had planned to leave an 'unspecified amount' of his PS34million fortune to his killer, reports the Express.  The Baronet left the Moorhill estate in Gillingham, which would be the scene of his murder, to Mrs Schreiber.  Sir Richard was the ninth baronet of the Sutton family, which can be traced back to William the Conqueror, who invaded Britain in 1066.   His successful hotel empire included the Sheraton Grand Park Lane and the Athenaeum. After 'sponging' off Sir Richard Sutton for years, Schreiber stabbed him to death with a kitchen knife in a frenzied attack which left the hotelier in a pool of blood. He was also convicted of attempting to murder his mother Anne, who he stabbed at least nine times in the neck and back. He is now serving a minimum sentence of 36 years behind bars.   Schreiber lived with the couple at the mansion following his mother's divorce from his alcoholic father David.  But despite this, the court heard how he resented them for abandoning his father, who died in 2013. On the eighth anniversary of the death of Schreiber's father, Sir Richard had a knife plunged 12cm into his heart while Mrs Schreiber was repeatedly stabbed. The 'Moorhill' estate in the hamlet of Higher Langham near Gillingham, Dorset, was left looking like a 'warzone' following the murderous rampage. The Sutton family released a statement after the verdict, which read: 'How could any family recover from such a sudden and devastating loss. 'We can never bring back Sir Richard but his spirit will very much live on, alongside the very happy memories we have of our incredible father, brother and grandfather. 'His values of being warm, generous and compassionate to everyone he met will be carried forward by future generations, and will never be extinguished.' At Winchester Crown Court in Hampshire a jury dismissed Schreiber's defence he was suffering from a mental disorder which meant he was not in control on the night of the killing. After four hours and 18 minutes deliberating, they were unable to come to a unanimous decision and were asked to return a majority verdict. Just 33 minutes later, they found Schreiber guilty of the murder of Sir Richard and the attempted murder of Mrs Schreiber by a margin of 11 to one. The killer, wearing a blue suit and pink shirt, stared down at the ground in the dock, as the verdicts were read out. A whispered cry of 'yes' was heard from the public gallery above, where Sir Richard's children Caroline and David Sutton, as well as other members of the family, were sat. During the 14-day trial, Schreiber claimed he picked up the knife when he heard a voice in his head saying 'attack, attack' after he 'completely lost it' when his mother branded him 'drunk just like your father'. But Mrs Schreiber, the only living witness of the attack which left her paralysed and suffering from poor memory, said she was in a 'good mood' and was cooking in the kitchen when she heard a 'kerfuffle' which made her turn around to see her son walk in and pick up the knife from a block on the kitchen island. Speaking from Salisbury Hospital's spinal unit after the attack, she told police: 'Thomas looked unusual... His eyes were quite weird... I would say almost frightening to look at because they looked terribly, terribly determined. 'I received some stabs from him and I remember looking at the knife in me and being surprised that it didn't hurt more. 'Then I believe - I may be wrong - but I believe Richard comes in to the kitchen from his other living room shouting and screaming. 'He was definitely alive then because I did see him... I 100 per cent believe he was alive then. 'I remember seeing him at least making an entrance, talking in a loud voice. I don't know what happened to Richard. 'You want the truth and honestly I can't say that I saw Richard being stabbed by Thomas but I know I am [being stabbed] that's for sure.' The Forfeiture Rule is a law which prevents a criminal from benefitting from their crime in any way.  So, for example, if someone unlawfully kills another person, they would not then be entitled to benefit in any way from the death of their victim.  This means, much like Thomas Schreiber, who stabbed his millionaire stepfather to death, they would forfeit any inheritance they had previously been entitled to, either under the terms of the Will or the Rules of Intestacy. This law has been established primarily to prevent convicted murderers from being able to inherit from their victim's Estate, and the rule is clear in how it is applied in such situations.  If one person murders another then they should not be able to inherit anything from them, regardless of the circumstances. What's more, if a property is owned jointly as joint tenants, then if one owner murders the other they will not then be able to take sole ownership of the property. This differs to the usual rules applied to property owned as joint tenants if one owner dies. In normal circumstances, when one joint owner of a property dies, the property would automatically transfer into the sole ownership of the surviving joint owner, regardless of what the Will states. When a person is convicted of manslaughter, the law states that they should not benefit from their crime, unless it would be unfair or unjust to deprive them of a benefit they stand to receive. All the circumstances surrounding the case will need to be considered in order for the judge to make a decision on this. If there has been no conviction at all, then the Court may use their discretion to determine whether to waiver the Forfeiture Rule.  Source:  Co-op legal Mrs Schreiber was found barely breathing in the kitchen by armed police but Sir Richard had managed to limp upstairs, trying to set off an alarm and call the police along the way, before Schreiber picked up a second knife, hunted him down and stabbed him a further five times. His body was found on the upstairs landing, with blood splashed across the wall in front of him. The court heard Schreiber then fled the scene in Sir Richard's Range Rover, leading police on a 135mph chase from Wiltshire to London where he was finally apprehended by officers. After he was forced to stop he began to stab himself with a third knife he had grabbed from the mansion before his escape but he was stunned by a taser to prevent him from killing himself. The jury heard how Schreiber living with the couple at the sprawling country estate became a 'vicious triangle' as Sir Richard became 'consumed' with trying to get rid of the aspiring painter. His daughter Caroline Sutton even revealed the hotelier paid Schreiber PS100,000 for a house deposit in a desperate attempt to get him to leave his home. In November 2020, Sir Richard hit Schreiber on the back with a walking stick following a heated family row over the inheritance of a chandelier. This row, the court heard, isolated Schreiber from his family and was a 'watershed moment' in his relationship with them. He began obsessively scouring the internet for articles about revenge and became 'consumed with hatred' towards his mother and Sir Richard. The jury heard how Schreiber told friends he was planning revenge and wanted to 'go out with a bang' just months before the killing. In March 2021 he wrote to his best friend James Reid: 'Simply put I contemplate murdering them all morning day and night. It's not what I want to think about but it's the truth. I want them to suffer.' He added: 'I think and strategise every single day about how best to murder my mother and co... that's how bad my mind is at.' He also told his friend Fedor: 'The short story is, my mum is a gold digging f***ing b****, she is a selfish, manipulative, toxic, gold digging b****. 'We moved here 17 years ago, this huge house, with her partner... she's only there to cook for him and take his money. 'He's a multi multi-millionaire, he's never had to work a day in his life, he inherited everything, all property, all land basically around the world. He's an absolute c***. 'He's horribly racist, horribly backwards, horribly old-fashioned, horribly English... I don't have a good word to say about him frankly and I can't stand him.",

Anita Jarzyna, 29, was summarily dismissed as team leader at a bedding company following a series of complaints from seven staff over her racist language about purchasing manager Daniel Bowler and his girlfriend Erika Mateova. One member of staff said: 'Anita doesn't like anybody. She is mean to most people.'  The ex-nightclub barmaid attempted to justify her remarks during a night out in a wine bar, telling colleagues: 'I can say what I like - I am Polish. It's okay to say it in Poland so why is it not okay here?' At a tribunal, an employment judge ruled bosses at Hypnos Beds in Buckinghamshire failed to follow proper procedure after inquiries revealed they took 15 minutes to make a decision to sack her and refused her an appeal hearing. The judge ordered the firm to pay a 'basic' award' of PS630 plus compensation of PS2,214. He cleared Hypnos of racial and sexual discrimination. No one from the company attended the Watford hearing. Ms Jarzyna, from Olsztyn, North Poland, had joined Hypnos in 2015 but fell out with Mr Bowler and and Ms Mateova, who worked as a knitwork designer at the firm. The tribunal was told Ms Mateova had hoped to get the team leader's job but her rival was given the post instead and it caused 'antipathy between them.' In November 2019, Mr Bowler and Ms Mateova raised grievances against Ms Jarzyna over comments she made while speaking to other colleagues in the wine bar the previous month. His complaint read: 'Anita referred to me as the 'f***ing P***' in conversation with the others. One of these did say you cannot say that and Anita responded with 'I can say what I like, I am Polish'.' Ms Mateova said in a statement: 'It was brought to my attention that Anita refers to me as the 'gypsy c***' and has said this on a few occasions.' One staff member, Tom White, said: 'I speak to Anita a lot and when we talk about work she often talks about herself.  'She has been annoyed with Danny Bowler for a while, she doesn't get on with him at all and doesn't like him. Her main gripe is with Danny, she doesn't like Erika because she's with him. 'Anita and I were talking while I was working and I said my next job was for Erika, she said 'Oh, You're going to see that gypsy c***.' She's called her that to me probably four more times on different occasions since then. 'I'd heard she'd been suspended so I called her to make sure she was okay. She told me what had happened and that she'd lost her temper outside and people had heard her shouting 'gypsy c***' and 'P***'. 'She then called them a 'gypsy c***' and 'P***' to me again. We talked for about 20 minutes. She admitted to me what had happened in the wine bar and what she'd said about Erika. 'She tends to get stressed and react badly to situations. I asked her why she'd said what she did and she said she's Polish and can say what she likes. She said: 'It's okay to say it in Poland so why is it not okay here?' 'She clearly doesn't think saying it is wrong. After her suspension she went around everyone trying to find out who had grassed her up, she assumed it was them and then said she'd been grassed up by 'that P.*** and gypsy c***'.' Another work colleague, Sam Hatt, said: 'We were all sat around the table talking and someone mentioned the word Christmas party and who was going.  'Someone mentioned that Danny and Erika were going and Anita shouted loudly 'I'm not going if that gypsy c*** is going'. 'We all told her she couldn't say things like that and she didn't say it again that evening.' A third staff member, who is Polish and wished to remain anonymous, said: 'The main problem with Anita is she just doesn't like anybody.  'I've often heard her talking badly about Erika, she always calls her a gypsy to the rest of the sewing team but everybody is too scared to come and tell you. She is mean to most people.' The hearing was told Ms Jarzyna attended a disciplinary hearing accompanied by her GMB Union Representative and was asked to respond to the racism claims.  The meeting then adjourned for 15 minutes after which she was dismissed for gross misconduct. Ms Jarzyna tried to appeal but no hearing was undertaken. Ms Jarzyna agreed she had gone to the wine bar and gossiped about Mr Bowler but denied calling him a 'f***ing P***'. She claimed Mr Bowler was lying to get her fired and had called her a 'Polish cow.' She said: 'Mr Bowler is English but his skin is slightly tanned. I do not know what his nationality or race is. When we talked about him in the wine bar I swore a lot but didn't call him a P***.'  She also denied calling Ms Mateova a 'gypsy c***'. In conclusion, Employment Judge George Alliott said: 'The claimant did use offensive and racist language both in and out of the workplace.  'However, given the burden of proof, I cannot find that the respondent genuinely believed in the reason for dismissal in the absence of any evidence from the respondent. Accordingly, I have to find that the dismissal was unfair. 'I accept an appeal hearing is not mandatory - however, the claimant pointed to an individual who, whilst charged with an offence of theft, did apparently retain his job on appeal. The respondent has not been here to contest the issue.'",

    "6014651c0bdbc626bfbc56f1e4372dd2919f35d61163fcf9c497b196": "Only 300 migrants will be sent to Rwanda a year under the government's controversial scheme, according to a Home Office model.  The PS120m agreement was announced last month, with Boris Johnson saying 'tens of thousands' would be sent to Rwanda under the deal.  Home Office modelling, however, suggests the programme will be on a tiny fraction of the scale suggested initially by the prime minister. The policy - which will send adult migrants who are 'inadmissible for asylum' off to Rwanda for their cases to be processed - was presented last month as a solution to the Channel crossing problem. Over 7,300 migrants have crossed the Channel this year alone, marking a threefold increase in the rate of arrivals compared with last year.  Boris Johnson has defended the policy from fierce criticism, with the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby among the scheme's most prominent detractors. The prime minister said the Rwanda programme would stop people-smuggling gangs exploiting the vulnerable, who risk ending up in a 'watery grave' as they cross the choppy and treacherous Channel. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, hit out at the policy, saying the Home Office analysis was a sign of its internal weakness. Mr Solomon told The Times: 'The government's desire to treat people as human cargo expelling them to Rwanda is not only appallingly unprincipled, it is also unworkable. 'The government now seems to be realising that the challenges of making it a reality are far greater than it had anticipated.  'There's a likelihood that it could easily unravel and certainly never be on a scale the prime minister said it could be.' The Home Office analysis estimated only 300 people would be sent to Rwanda a year by comparing the number of migrants who were categorised as 'inadmissible' for asylum under a previous EU system that applied in Britain pre-Brexit. Under the EU's Dublin Regulations, which stopped applying to the UK after December 31 2020, identical 'asylum admissibility' rules were used to sort migrants as will be used in the new Rwanda scheme. Fewer than 300 asylum seekers a year were branded 'asylum inadmissible' in the final six years of Britain's tenure under the Dublin Regulations.  A government spokesperson said they did not recognise the Home Office analysis, however, and emphasised that the number who could be sent to Rwanda was 'uncapped'.  The spokesperson said that one of the criterion for labelling someone 'asylum inadmissible' was the realistic chance of being able to remove them to a safe country, meaning that the Rwanda deal had raised the probability of many falling into this classification. In a statement, they said: 'The entire government is united in our efforts to prevent lethal crossings, save lives and disrupt illegal migration.' What is the scheme? The Government announced plans to send thousands of migrants to Rwanda, in east Africa, last month.  The scheme is designed to deter economic migrants by showing even if they reach the UK, they're not allowed to remain here.  When they arrive in Rwanda, asylum seekers will have their claims processed and if approved, will be allowed to stay in Rwanda. They will not be allowed to return to the UK.  Those who fail in their asylum applications will be deported back to their home country.  Who is eligible? People arriving in the UK illegally, including in small boats and lorries, will be considered for relocation to Rwanda. It will apply to anyone who arrived in the UK from January 1, this year, and not just people arriving after the first flights have been arranged.  Ministers have said the scheme is meant to be focused on single, young men, but anyone regardless of sex is eligible. The Government says families will not be broken up and unaccompanied children will not be sent. How much will it cost? The Government says the scheme will cost PS120 million, but critics have predicted it would cost considerably more. Think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research pointed out that Australia's scheme has cost taxpayers around PS5.2 billion since 2013.  Conservative former minister Andrew Mitchell said housing asylum seekers at the Ritz hotel would be cheaper, putting the figure at PS2million per person, per year. When will it start? Boris Johnson said he wanted the first flights to leave at the end of May, but this looks unlikely to happen. The scheme is likely to be challenged in court by human rights lawyers, but ministers believe it is legal under UK and EU laws.  Why is it so controversial? Human rights groups, opposition MPs and backbench Tories have said the plan is cruel and expensive. Amnesty International says there are concerns over enforced disappearances, allegations of torture and excessive use of force' in Rwanda.  The Government says Rwanda is a safe country with a track record of supporting asylum seekers.  Opposition leader Keir Starmer branded the PM 'desperate' and said the plans were 'unworkable, extortionate and will cost the taxpayer billions of pounds'.",

The actress, 36, was walking off the stand after telling the Virginia courthouse how her ex-husband had sexually assaulted her with a liquor bottle and threatened to kill her in March 2015 in Australia. At the same time, Depp, who is partially sighted, stood up and moved towards the Aquaman star as the warring pair locked eyes. Heard physically shuddered and looked terrified, taking a step back as court officials immediately turned towards Depp and put their hands up, warning him to stay away. The Pirates of the Caribbean actor then turned away and appeared to shrug and smirk. Heard was led to the side of the room by the court officials before Depp went through the rear door for a cigarette during the 15-minute recess.  The former couple have mostly avoided eye contact throughout the blockbuster trial. During Heard's testimony, Depp has been seen hunched over a notepad where he has been writing notes and doodling. Before the tense encounter, the actress broke down as she testified that Depp had sexually assaulted her and threatened to kill her in what his defense team labeled the 'performance of her life.'  The alleged assault took place in March 2015 in Australia at their rented home he was living in while filming Pirates of the Caribbean 5. This is the same incident that saw Johnny Depp's finger severed. He claimed Heard threw a liquor bottle which severed it. Heard testified that she did not witness Depp's fingertip being cut off.  'At some point he's on top of me, screaming I f**king hate you, you ruined my f**king life,' Heard testified as she sobbed uncontrollably. 'I'm on the countertop, he had me by the neck and was on top of me. 'I'm looking in his eyes and I don't see him any more. It wasn't him, it was black. I haven't been so scared in my life. He was looking at me. I was trying to get through to him, to say in some way it was me. Trying to get through to Johnny. 'My head was bashing against the back of the bar and I couldn't breathe. I remember trying to get up to tell him he was really hurting me. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't get through to him. I couldn't get up.' At this point, Heard became overwhelmed with emotion on the stand.  'Next thing I remember I was bent over backwards on the bar, I was staring at the blue light. My back was on the countertop. I thought he was punching me. I felt this pressure on my pubic bone and I could feel his arm moving. It looked like he was punching me. I could just feel this pressure. 'I don't remember what I said, I just remember being really still, not wanting to move. I remember looking around the room, looking at all the broken bottles, broken glass and I remember not wanting to move because I didn't know if it was broken, I didn't know if the bottle that he had inside me was broken. 'I couldn't feel it, I didn't feel pain, I didn't feel anything. 'I saw so much broken glass I didn't know if he would know if it was broken or not and I remember thinking please go I hope it's not broken. I don't know how that ended. I don't know how I got off the countertop. 'I just remember being in the bathroom. I remember retching, the sound my voice was making. I lost control of my bladder. I remember just retching, there was blood on the floor.' Depp's team claimed the actress' tales of abuse have evolved with 'new and convenient details' and plan on exposing her lies on cross-examination.  Heard said that leading up to the fight Depp confirmed he had not slept not had he eaten. 'We get into an argument. He was accusing me of (sleeping with) Eddie Redmayne (her co-star in The Danish Girl). He thought I was working with Billy Bob Thornton but I'd already worked with him a year earlier. He was very upset about him.' Heard said that Depp had taken 8-10 MDMA pills. She said, 'He confirmed he took that amount and he could take that amount. 8 or 10.' She said Depp continued accusing her of cheating on him. She said, 'He calls his agent, he calls a few people and he's screaming at them. I got a sense it was money, he got a sense people had been stealing from him. 'He was calling himself a wh**e, he'd been wh**ed out.' 'Next thing I remember is coming downstairs and looking for him. We had an interaction that I can't really describe, it didn't make a lot of sense to me. Just belligerent, throwing things, screaming at me. I realized I was back on the chopping block,' Heard said.  'He has me up against the wall, he slams me hard, I hit my head hard. This is the wall next to the kitchenette. There were these fridges and I remember being slammed up against those. I remember pushing him off of me. The name calling, the wh**e, the slut the fat a**. 'He was squeezing my neck. It got really nasty. It went from no one likes you, everyone warned me about you. He said everyone had warned him about me and he wished he'd never married me. That no one liked me. 'At some point I shoved him and he shoved me back. He said: 'Do you want to go little girl?'  Heard said she was struggling with him and he threw her across the room.  'I land on a games table. He gets on top of me on the games table and is just whacking me in the face, repetitive. We struggled. 'He's taunting me to take the bottle from him. He's holding out the bottle, the third time I get a hold of it, I slam it down on the ground between us. That really set him off. 'It was like a lightbulb switch went off. He starts screaming. I don't know if he backhanded me or hit me. It sent me down to the ground. By the time I picked myself off the floor he's got a bottle in his hand, he threw it at me, it missed. 'He had a broken bottle up against my face, neck area and he told me I'll carve up your face. It was terrifying. 'I remember him having me by the nightgown. I remember him throwing me around, I'm flailing. 'He's throwing these bottles at me. There's soda cans and they're coming at me one after another. I keep pulling myself into the bar area. He's standing in the only area you can exit. 'I can feel glass breaking behind me. I can remember being terrified. I couldn't move, I couldn't go anywhere. He ran out of things to throw, I ran to the exit and we got into this struggle by the bar area 'I remember my feet slipping on the tile as he was slamming me from the wall to the countertop. He had my nightgown and ripped it off my chest. 'He's teasing me he has my breasts in his hand, my nightgown came completely off, it was ripped off of me, I was naked. 'He's flinging me around. He's screaming at me he f**king hates me, I ruined his life. Over and over. He starts punching the wall next to my head, holding me by the neck. 'His energy shifted to the phone on the wall. He went from punching the wall, he picked up the phone - rahhhh! - screaming at the top of his lungs, I f**king hate you. He starts bashing the phone against the wall. 'Every time he pulled his hand back it was breaking into pieces, he's smashing it to smithereens.' He is suing his ex-wife for $50million for defamation, claiming she ruined his career with a 2018 Washington Post article which claimed she was a victim of domestic abuse. She is counter-suing for $100million. ",
    "db1b382bf80db098172619ffa3fbdae16b9e7e542273023021919b59": "Former health secretary Matt Hancock said he has been 'humbled' after welcoming a family of seven Ukrainian refugees to his Suffolk home over Easter, and is enjoying discovering the national cuisine. The Conservative MP said that it is a 'wonderful' experience hosting the three generation family, along with their four dogs -- and has been supported by the 'helpful' community. The 43-year-old opened his constituency home to them on Friday, April 15, as previously revealed by MailOnline.  'I've enjoyed getting to know Ukrainian food and picking up the basics of the language,' he wrote in The Spectator. 'It's humbling living with three generations from one family who have escaped war with little more than the clothes on their backs. It brings perspective. 'They video-call family and friends left behind who live under the threat of bombardment, and it's striking just how close to home this conflict is. 'The teenagers staying with me study by remote learning at their college in Kyiv while the shells fall.' Mr Hancock said that since the family arrived, the Suffolk community have helped them with school places, jobs and transport. 'Within days we had bikes, places at schools and college, and a Volvo from the local car salesroom, while the wonderful team at the Bedford Lodge Hotel have offered not just training but jobs,' he said.  'They say it takes a village to raise a child. It takes a town to welcome refugees -- and towns like Newmarket are stepping up to the plate.' The family he welcomed are related to one of Mr Hancock's constituents. He is hosting their mother and two sisters, their niece, nephew, nephew's partner and grandmother.  Last month, the Suffolk MP decided not publicise their arrival in his constituency home, unlike other party colleagues who have done the same.  Speaking at the time, a source told MailOnline: 'Matt has not talked about this because he doesn't want to be accused of just doing it for publicity -- he's not. 'He's just wanting to help a desperate family, in one of the only ways he can. The low-key arrival - unmentioned by Mr Hancock or on any of his social media feeds - is something of a rebuff to his critics. When he told his local radio station back in March he was taking part in the Homes for Ukraine scheme and later appeared on GMB, some accused him of a media stunt. Sometimes-presenter Richard Madeley had suggested 'The reason you're doing this is to help rebuild your reputation after you had a bad political fall'. At the time Mr Hancock had denied it and insisted it had been nothing of the sort. He said it was 'the other way around' and that it was the media who had taken an interest. Last month, Conservative MP Grant Shapps took in a 'three-generation' family, as well as their dog named Max, to live with him in his Hertfordshire home. The 53-year-old politician previously said he was taking in a six-year-old boy, his mother and his 75-year-old grandmother. The family are making use of one his children's bedrooms while they are away at university. Mr Shapps wrote on Twitter: 'Whilst their country goes through the turmoil of Putin's war, our country stands resolutely with the people of Ukraine.' Former Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick was the first MP to welcome a Ukrainian family into his constituency home under the Government's refugee visa scheme. The MP for Newark collected 40-year-old Mariia and her two children Khystyna, 11, and Bohdan, 15, from Stansted airport himself. The former housing secretary, 40, said that he found it 'emotional' and 'humbling' when he finally met the refugees after applying to host them three weeks prior. 'They are children of not dissimilar ages to ours, and a mother who's left her husband back home and made this extraordinary decision... to leave home and come to another country in order to protect her children. 'It was quite emotional. I have to say they've been absolutely lovely to us and we've enjoyed it so far,' he said. The Conservative MP has three daughters, ten-year-old Marina, Sophia, eight, and Lila, six, with his wife Michal Berkner. The Home Office scheme has come under fire since it was launched, with critics frustrated with 'red tape' that is slowing down refugee arrivals into the UK. The family scheme and the sponsorship scheme have seen a combined total of 117,600 applications since their launch. Of these, 86,100 had been granted as of April 27. Boris Johnson's Government announced in March that the scheme would allow anyone in England to host a family or individual, if they agreed to housing and criminal-records checks. In response, local support networks and individuals set up numerous Facebook groups - and these have become one of the main ways of connecting Ukrainian families and British sponsors.",
    "e720f8e13a415a742263f8a36a5c1d112d709b08f69253e8f700b978": "Hugh Edwards has left BBC viewers in stitches after he wiped his mouth and admitted eating a croissant live on air during the channel's local election coverage. Reeta Chakrabarti was presenting the latest local elections figures at a screen in the BBC News studio when the camera panned back to an unsuspecting Edwards, who initially licked his lips before having to wipe away crumbs with his fingers.  He had anchored the BBC's coverage overnight, which ran from 11.40pm on Thursday night to 6am this morning. He thanked Reeta, before telling viewers: 'I'm going to admit to you that I just had a little bit of croissant.  'So I'm just finishing it and I'm ashamed to say that, but there you go. It's 20 to six in the morning.' And viewers have taken to social media to share their enjoyment of the incident. One said: 'Huw Edwards eating a croissant is the only #LocalElections22 news you need today.' Another added: 'Choosing a croissant when you have to appear on live TV is BOLD. I'm impressed there's no flakes of it in sight.' A third said: 'I love watching that man on TV. He could eat a three course meal during the news and I would forgive him and watch.' Others have referred to the news presented as a 'national treasure' and told him not to be ashamed. A viewer said: 'Dear Huw Edwards, Don't be ashamed. Live your best croissant life.' Another added: 'We're going to croissant over now to our reporter at the polling booths.' And a third said: 'Big Bite of Croissant (BBC) news is undefeated.' It comes as Boris Johnson is today facing demands to quit from furious Tories as the party suffered a local election nightmare in London - but Keir Starmer failed to make big strides towards power. After a campaign dominated by sleaze and Partygate, the Tories were defeated by Labour in the totemic strongholds of Wandsworth and Westminster - which they have held since 1978 and 1964 respectively. The Conservatives also lost Barnet and Southampton to Labour and West Oxfordshire and Worcester to no overall control. As counting continues, livid local leaders are already turning on the PM, ordering Mr Johnson to 'look in the mirror' and consider whether he should stay.  But so far the results have not been as apocalyptic as some had predicted, with voting guru John Curtice saying Labour still does not look in a position to win a majority at the next general election.  He added: 'Outside of London, as compared to 2018 when these seats were last contested, it looks like their seats are down slightly.' 'And for a party that is trying to regain ground in the so-called Red Wall seats in the Midlands and north of England, this wasn't quite the progress they wanted. 'There is still a very substantial legacy of the impact of Brexit on both the character of the Conservative and Labour supporters. 'The Conservatives are still much stronger in Leave areas, and therefore Labour is still struggling to make more progress there.' Sir Keir described Labour's gains as 'absolutely brilliant' and a 'big turning point' for the party. Speaking to Labour campaigners in Barnet, he says: 'We've changed Labour and now we're seeing the results of that.' However, the leader of the Labour group of Barnet council, said this was less of a reflection on enthusiasm for his party and more a reflection of disillusionment with the Tories. Barry Rawlings told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I'll be honest, it's not us being wonderful. 'I think a lot of Conservatives haven't voted this time, I think they feel alienated from No 10 and that they are, I don't know, they've been disappointed with Boris Johnson and so not voting and I think that's made a difference as well.'",
    "6e8cba00d03d7fd272f766415692aa188abae9eb656431b5e437d3f2": "The EU is planning to impose sanctions on Vladimir Putin's alleged gymnast lover Alina Kabaeva for her role in Kremlin propaganda, according to a document. Kabaeva is a late addition to the list of individuals targeted in a sixth package of measures against Russia in response to the war in Ukraine, after she last month likened the Soviet victory over Nazism in the Second World War to Putin's invasion. The proposal identifies Kabaeva as the chairwoman of the board of directors of the National Media Group, a holding company that owns significant shares in almost all major Russian state media that make up Putin's propaganda machine. The former gymnast and former Duma lawmaker is 'closely associated with President Vladimir Putin,' the document adds. The Russian leader, who will be 70 this year, has since 2008 denied a relationship with Olympic gold-medal winning Kabaeva, now 38. The Moscow newspaper that first reported on their relationship closed down soon after. Another notable figure on the list is the head of the Russian Orthodox Church - Patriarch Kirill - who has given his blessing to Putin's on-going invasion, despite Eastern Orthodoxy being the predominant religion in Ukraine. If passed, Kabaeva and Kirill would join a growing list of 1,000 influential Russian and pro-Russian figures that have already been sanctioned by the EU. They will face travel bans and asset freezes under the measures.  The EU sanctions, which also include a ban on Russian oil imports, were submitted on Wednesday by the EU executive to member states for approval, which requires unanimity among the 27 countries. Hungary, Slovakia and other eastern European countries are so far refusing the package, holding out for an opt out or delay to the oil ban. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, citing US officials, Kabaeva and her family have gained personal fortune thanks to her connection to Putin's inner circle. The report cites classified US intelligence that names Kabaeva as a beneficiary of Putin's wealth. US officials have held off sanctioning Kabaeva themselves out of concern that Putin might view it as a personal attack, The Guardian reported.  Three other people, columnists at the state agency Ria Novosti, are also on the list for their role in disseminating 'government propaganda' over the war in Ukraine. The four names are in addition to 58 people - including Patriarch Kirill, numerous military personnel suspected of war crimes in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and family members of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The document describes Kirill as 'one of the most prominent supporters of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine'. His support for the war has led to a public rebuke from the Pope. Another figure that is expected to be added to the list is Marina Mordashova - the wife of Alexei Mordashov, officially Russia's richest man (although Putin is believed to be far wealthier). The EU says this is because Ms Mordashova benefits from her husbands assets. Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, European sanctions have already affected 1,091 people and 80 entities. News of the EU sanctions comes days after a report claimed that Putin had two secret sons with Kabaeva. The first boy was born in secrecy in Switzerland amid huge security in 2015, according to a source linked to the obstetrician who was at the birth. The second son was delivered in Moscow in 2019 with the same specialist flying to Russia for the birth, according to an investigation by Swiss broadsheet newspaper Sonntagszeitung. Putin has hidden his alleged secret family from voters - and was not present at either of the births, the report said. The report confirms strong rumours over a Putin-Kabaeva family, except in suggesting there was one son born in 2019 rather than twins. It also indicates that Kabaeva is the secret Russian first lady at a time when the country is suffering major losses from the war with Ukraine. The source of the new report - published on Sunday - is said to be a personal friend of Kabaeva who also knows the obstetrician, an unnamed Soviet-born medic acquainted with Putin for more than three decades and a long-time Swiss citizen after emigrating from Russia. The paper reported: 'Our source says clearly: 'Alina's relationship with Putin existed. Their children - two sons - are Putin's children. Alina had no other relationship. That would have been too dangerous for her'.' The female doctor works at Clinica Sant'Anna in the Italian-speaking Ticino region of Switzerland where the first child was born. The obstetrician had 'maintained a trusting relationship with Putin', said the report. 'You had to keep the whole thing very discreet,' the newspaper was told. Contrary to gossip in 2015, Putin was not present at the birth which - at the time - the Kremlin denied. There was also only one Putin-Kabaeva child born in Switzerland, said the source. By the 'president's decision', the second son was born in Moscow. The same Russian emigre Swiss obstetrician delivered the second son in Moscow in 2019. Before the birth, Kabaeva had travelled in secret to Lugano several times. The source described Kabaeva as 'a very pleasant woman. 'She is a real sportswoman, very straight, without posturing. She came with her mother and sister, but without bodyguards. Despite this, a blanket of secrecy was thrown over the births.' Kabaeva had also travelled multiple times to Switzerland before starting her relationship with Putin, believed to be in 2007. She was an ambassador for Longines watches from 1999 to 2008. Their relationship was first reported when a Moscow newspaper alleged Putin had secretly divorced his wife of 30 years Lyudmila and was planning to marry Kabaeva. The Kremlin denied the claims, and the newspaper was soon shut down. Five years later, Putin and his wife announced their separation. Recently, rumours suggested that Kabaeva and her suspected young children were hiding out from the war at a reclusive Swiss chalet. However last month - after a four-month absence from the limelight - she reappeared in Moscow. Kabaeva used the build-up to her 'Alina 2022' show in Moscow in April to make her first appearance in public since the war started in Ukraine. This followed rumours she had been hiding in Switzerland - or in a hi-tech Siberian nuclear bunker. At the show itself she was filmed in front of the 'Z' symbols of Putin's troops, which critics have likened to a swastika symbol. Wearing a patriotic St George's ribbon on her chest, Kabaeva delivered a rousing speech seemingly linking victory over Nazism in the Second World War to today's events in Ukraine. 'This theme, you see, this story, doesn't only go into the past. It stays with us,' she said. 'This celebration is not just for the whole country, this is a holiday for every family. 'Every family has a war story, and we mustn't ever forget it, but pass it on from generation to generation.' She wore a PS1,915 from a British-based designer as she led a patriotic-themed gymnastics ballet in which she linked the defeat of Hitler's Nazis to the Russian fight against Ukraine. The event included some of the Soviet Union's most patriotic songs in a celebration of the country's victory over the Germans. The theme at her annual festival was unmistakably intended to boost patriotic support for Putin's military operation in Ukraine. She wore a wedding ring and a fluid silk fuchsia midi dress. Russians were struck by Kabaeva's new look, sparking rumours of recent cosmetic surgery. Russian Cosmopolitan said 'something has really changed in Kabaeva's face', adding that 'the legendary athlete was noticeably prettier'. Avoiding linking her to Putin, it said of a woman widely believed to be Russia's unofficial first lady: 'Alina Kabaeva is one of the most mysterious and secretive women in our country. 'The gymnast almost never appears in public, does not [appear in] social networks, and it is not possible to accidentally see her on the street or in shopping centres.' Telegram channel Tol'ko Nikomu - also choosing its words carefully to avoid the Russian censor - hinted that she and Putin share the same plastic surgeon. 'A new rare appearance of Alina Kabaeva. This time she is dressed casually - and is again seen with a wedding ring. 'And yes, the handwriting of the family beautician is quite notable.' Jailed Putin foe Alexei Navalny had previously demanded sanctions against Kabaeva. He singled out Kabaeva's National Media Group arguing that it was likely owned by Putin - who will be 70 this year - personally. Her salary here has been estimated at almost PS8 million a year, compared with the average annual figure of PS5,600. Navalny posted from jail: 'I want to remind you that the National Media Group, which owns the lion's share of this apparatus of lies, undoubtedly belongs to Putin personally, and as such is even formally headed by Putin's mistress Alina Kabaeva.' He called her a Putin propagandist and said she should be treated as a 'war criminal'. Kabaeva has kept a low profile in the Ukraine war - but her media has been vocal in cheerleading for Putin. Soon after the war started, a petition called on the Swiss authorities to send her packing back to Russia. 'It's time you reunite Eva Braun with her Fuhrer', said the petition. Rumours first linked her romantically to Putin as long ago as 2008 when she was a pro-Kremlin MP. The newspaper printing the story was rapidly closed down. Putin - who in 2013 announced his divorce from wife Lyudmila, a former Aeroflot stewardess - has previously said: 'I have a private life in which I do not permit interference. It must be respected.' He deplored 'those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others' lives'. Kabaeva is on record as saying she had met a man who 'I love very much', gushing: 'Sometimes you feel so happy that you even feel scared.' In 2001 Kabaeva was temporarily banned from competing in rhythmic gymnastics after failing a doping test. A year earlier she had won gold at the 2000 summer Olympics. Once regarded as Russia's most eligible woman, her only other suitor has been a married Georgian policeman, according to media reports. This relationship petered out in 2005 amid complaints of tabloid intrusion into her life. She once posed almost nude for Maxim and was described as 'full of sex' by a photographer. There have been many reports of her wearing a wedding ring, but no records of a marriage. She is reported to have a fleet of Maybach limousines at her disposal, and was seen surrounded by a squad of machine-gun toting security guards on visits to a Moscow cafe, likely indicating she qualifies for state-level security. The dictator of neighbouring Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko hinted that Putin's divorce decision came about because Kabaeva 'put pressure on the president'.",
    "45f1f4d273bebd7670fce40347a349e99d3a2a24996ded9d35cb25c8": "The Lib Dems and Greens are emerging as the biggest winners from the local elections today after voters shunned the main parties.  Both the Tories and Labour suffered disappointing results, with Boris Johnson enduring a bloodbath in London while Keir Starmer's progress across England was underwhelming. But the Lib Dems have added more than 50 councillors to their tally and seized control of Kingston-Upon-Hull authority from Labour. They made inroads against the Conservatives in West Oxfordshire and Stockport.  For their part, the Greens have racked up an extra 20-plus seats.  Election guru John Curtice said the Lib Dems were 'the surprise of tonight'. 'In terms of share of the vote, the progress is relatively modest, but they might just be hoping they are finally demonstrating some recovery from the 2015 general election,' he told the BBC. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said: 'There is now a real picture emerging across the country, particularly in areas held by the Conservatives, that the Lib Dems are the real challengers.'  Mr Johnson is facing a backlash from local Conservatives after his party lost Thatcher's beloved Wandsworth to Labour for the first time since 1978, as well as Barnet and even Westminster, a council which has been blue since its creation in 1964. The Tories also lost Worcester to no overall control, with gains for the Greens and Labour. Conservative Holds: Broxbourne, Thurrock, Nuneaton & Bedworth, Epping Forest, Basildon, Rochford, Brentwood, Harlow, Rushmoor, Redditch, Fareham, Amber Valley, North East Lincolnshire, Tamworth, Dudley, Bexley, Hillingdon Losses: Worcester (to no overall control), Wandsworth (to Labour), Southampton (to Labour), West Oxfordshire (to NOC), Barnet (to Labour) Labour Gains: Cumberland (from NOC), Wandsworth (from Tories), Southampton (from Tories), Barnet (from Tories) Holds: Sunderland, Halton, South Tyneside, Chorley, Tameside, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sefton, Stevenage, Lincoln, Sandwell, Exeter, Ipswich, Wigan, Coventry, Salford, North Tyneside, Preston, Oldham, Waltham Forest, Wolverhampton, Barnsley, Ealing, Barking & Dagenham, Redbridge Loss: Kingston-upon-Hull (to Lib Dems) Lib Dems Gain: Kingston-upon-Hull (from Labour) Hold: Eastleigh   What other results are expected and when? Around 9am: Counting begins for a further 71 councils in England and all councils in Scotland and Wales.  But outside London, the picture is distinctly mixed for Sir Keir. The party retained Sunderland but lost Hull to Sir Ed Davey's Lib Dems. It was a similar story for the Green Party who chipped away at Conservative and Labour seats in England.  Labour picked up control of the new Cumberland authority, where senior local Tory John Mallinson called for Mr Johnson to go. The leader of Carlisle City Council told the BBC: 'I think it is not just partygate, there is the integrity issue. Basically I just don't feel people any longer have the confidence that the Prime Minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.'  He said he expected Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Tory 1922 Committee, to soon receive more letters of no-confidence in Mr Johnson from MPs.  In Portsmouth, where the Tories lost four seats, Simon Bosher the leader of the Conservative group said Mr Johnson should 'take a good, strong look in the mirror' because 'those are people that are actually bearing the brunt on the doorstep of behaviour of what's been going on in Westminster'.  Ravi Govindia, leader of the Wandsworth Tories, said: 'Let's not be coy about it, of course national issues were part of the dilemma people were facing.' After results were declared from 58 councils, the Tories had lost control of three authorities and were down 79 councillors, Labour had a net gain of two councils and 34 councillors, the Lib Dems had one extra authority and 34 more seats while the Greens had put on 19 councillors. The loss of Wandsworth will be a significant blow because of its symbolic status in London. It turned blue in 1978, a year before Thatcher's election as prime minister and was reputedly her favourite council, renowned for its low taxes. 'Boris Johnson losing Wandsworth is monumental. This was the Tories' jewel in the crown,' a Labour source said. Labour's success in Barnet, which has a large Jewish population, will be seen as a sign the party has turned the corner on the anti-Semitism rows which dogged Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.  However, the leader of the Labour group of Barnet council, said this was less of a reflection on enthusiasm for his party and more a reflection of disillusionment with the Tories. Barry Rawlings told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I'll be honest, it's not us being wonderful. 'I think a lot of Conservatives haven't voted this time, I think they feel alienated from No 10 and that they are, I don't know, they've been disappointed with Boris Johnson and so not voting and I think that's made a difference as well.' Council seats are up for grabs in Scotland, Wales and many parts of England, while there are elections to Stormont in Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein is expected to become the largest party for the first time, with results expected from lunchtime. Votes were only being counted in some of the English contests overnight, including key authorities in the capital.  The contests are the first chance for voters to have their say since the Prime Minister and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined for breaking coronavirus laws and the party was hit by other scandals including Neil Parish quitting after admitting he watched pornography in the Commons. The squeeze on household finances is also a major issue, as the Bank of England made clear on Thursday - with interest rates rising to 1%, inflation forecast to hit more than 10% and the economy predicted to contract in the final three months of the year. The Prime Minister was reported to have told aides yesterday that his party was 'going to get our a*** kicked'. And his fears appeared to be coming true with his party facing losses across England as the first results were announced.  Mid-term elections are always difficult for a governing party, although as many of the English seats were last contested in 2018, during Theresa May's chaotic administration, opportunities for opposition parties to make further gains may be limited. A Tory source conceded 'we expect these elections to be tough'. Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Kramer said she was 'obviously delighted' her party had taken control of Hull council. She told Sky News the party had had 'high hopes in Hull', adding that 'big significant local issues' like the number of GPs locally came up on the doorstep, as well as the cost of living crisis and the Partygate scandal over lockdown-busting gatherings. Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis insisted Mr Johnson remained the right person to lead the party, amid speculation that a bad set of election results - coupled with any further revelations about No 10 lockdown-busting parties - could see more Tory MPs submitting letters of no confidence.  The Northern Ireland Secretary told Sky News: 'I absolutely think we can win the next election, and I do think Boris Johnson is the right person to lead us into that.' Policing minister Kit Malthouse told the BBC: 'The further away you get from London, our sense is that the picture is better for us.' In Rutland, where there is not even an election, the Tories suffered a setback as county council leader Oliver Hemsley announced he was leaving the party, claiming the area had been 'ignored, side-lined and given no further improvements in our spending power' from the Government. Counting in many English authorities, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will not begin until later on Friday. When are the local elections?  Polling stations opened at 7am and closed at 10pm last night. What is up for grabs?  Local council elections are happening in England, but not in all areas. More than 4,000 councillors in 146 councils will be standing for election in major cities including Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and all 32 London boroughs. South Yorkshire will also be voting for a regional mayor and 1,000 parish councils will be electing around 10,000 councillors. All 32 councils in Scotland and all 22 in Wales will be holding elections, with residents able to vote from the age of 16. In Northern Ireland, voters will be electing 90 members, representing 18 constituencies, to the Northern Ireland Assembly. When will the results be announced?  The first batch of results is likely to be announced at midnight, with locations such as Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Essex, Greater Manchester and Bolton traditionally announced around this time. The latest is likely to be around 5pm on Saturday from Tower Hamlets. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not start counting until later this morning and the results are unlikely to be complete before tomorrow evening.  Labour's campaign has been hit by Tory calls for Durham Police to look into whether Sir Keir broke Covid rules while campaigning before the 2021 Hartlepool by-election - something he has dismissed as 'mudslinging'. The Tories have also complained about a secret pact between Labour and the Lib Dems to maximise Conservative pain in marginal seats, something denied by both opposition parties. Labour Party chair Anneliese Dodds acknowledged there would be 'ups and downs' in the results but said she hoped they would show progress since the 2019 general election drubbing under Jeremy Corbyn. Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth acknowledged there was a mountain to climb for the party following the 2019 general election. 'It's climbable, but my god it's a big mountain because we got an absolute hammering in 2019, the worst result since the 1930s,' he told the BBC. The Liberal Democrats focused on making further inroads in Tory heartlands - the 'Blue Wall' in southern England - following recent Westminster by-election successes in North Shropshire and Chesham and Amersham. Party leader Sir Ed said: 'I am optimistic that thanks to their hard work, the Liberal Democrats will gain ground in areas across the Blue Wall where voters are fed up of being taken for granted by the Conservatives.' After 45 councils had declared, the Tories had lost control of one authority and suffered a net loss of 50 seats, Labour had a net gain of 21 seats, the Lib Dems gained control of one council and put on 28 seats, while the Greens had gained 17 councillors. In England, more than 4,000 councillors in 146 councils are standing for election in major cities including Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and all 32 London boroughs. All 32 councils in Scotland and all 22 in Wales are also holding elections. In Northern Ireland voters went to the polls across 18 constituencies to elect 90 MLAs. The unionist DUP and republican Sinn Fein are vying for the top spot in the election, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister. A unionist party has always been the biggest in the Assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of the state in 1921. While the office of the first and deputy first minister is an equal one with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. A disastrous result for the Tories could spark fresh efforts among Conservative MPs - many of whom are still seething at Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street - to oust the Prime Minister from Number 10. A number of Tory council candidates, in a bid to distance themselves from Mr Johnson's Partygate woes, went into the election styled as 'Local Conservatives' . A council leader has resigned from the Conservative Party after accusing the government of 'ignoring' his county. Oliver Hemsley says he will continue leading Rutland County Council as an independent after announcing his resignation from the Conservative Group shortly after local election polls closed. Mr Hemsley said inequalities in Rutland have been 'compounded year-on-year' because of council tax and accused the government of 'ignoring and sidelining' the council despite repeated requests for help. The next elections for Rutland County Council won't take place until next year, though the Lib Dems won one seat being contested on Thursday. Meanwhile, Marc Bayliss, the Tory leader of Worcester City Council, told reporters he was heading home early from the election count and is anticipating a disastrous night for his party. Mr Bayliss blamed partygate and said the public had found the government's performance 'wanting'. He added: 'I think it is fair to say we are having a bad night.' His comments were echoed by the leader of the Conservatives on Sunderland Council, Antony Mullen, who called for Boris Johnson to step down. And some even urged voters not to 'punish' them for 'mistakes made in Westminster'. Some experts have suggested the Conservatives face losing 800 councillors and will take a clobbering from Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the Tories' so-called 'Blue Wall' zones. Pre-election forecasts pointed to the Tories even losing control of flagship councils such as Wandsworth and Westminster in London, as well as Southampton and Thurrock. A Tory loss of Wandsworth would prove a seismic result, as the London borough was famously Margaret Thatcher's favourite and has been a flagship Conservative council for more than 40 years. As votes began to be counted last night, Conservative insiders described it is a 'definite loss', along with the fellow London council of Barnet. But it has also been suggested that Conservative losses may not be as bad as the party fears, while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer may struggle to deliver a resounding success. This is because Labour performed very strongly in England council elections in 2018 - the last time most of the seats being fought for today were last contested. If Sir Keir does fail to achieve a convincing result - especially in the 'Red Wall' areas that turned Tory at the last general election - many in Labour will again question whether he really is the right man to lead the party's fightback, following their 2019 general election misery. The Labour leader, who has repeatedly demanded the PM's resignation over Partygate, went into yesterday's elections dogged by questions over his own 'Beergate' row. Shadow minister Tulip Siddiq highlighted Labour's holding of Sunderland City Council as an early success for her party. She claimed the Tories had 'thrown the kitchen sink at it' and highlighted how the PM had visited the area on Monday. Although the first results in England began to arrive last night, but counting in Wales and Scotland will not begin until 9am today. The results in Wales, where all 22 councils have held elections, will also be pored over by the Tories and Labour for signs of whether they are going forwards of backwards. They will be a crucial test for Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford, who saw his status soar during the Covid crisis - but who was also fiercely criticised for imposing tougher Coronavirus restrictions for longer than in England.  Meanwhile, in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will be looking for a strong result for the SNP as she cranks up her demands for a second independence referendum by the end of next year. All seats in all councils in Scotland are up for election, with more than 1,200 councillors due to be chosen. Voters in Bristol voted to scrap their elected mayor in a referendum on the way the city is run. In a vote on Thursday, 56,113 opted for a committee system, with 38,439 preferring to continue with an elected mayor, on a turnout of 28.6%. The referendum result is likely to be ratified at an extraordinary meeting of the full council on May 24, and Labour's Marvin Rees will continue as Bristol's mayor until May 2024, when the new system will start.  Green group leader Heather Mack said: 'The outcome of tonight's vote marks a new chapter in the way our city is run. For many years now, important decisions affecting the whole of our city have been made behind closed doors by just one person whom the public and elected councillors cannot easily challenge.' Councillor Jos Clark, leader of the Liberal Democrat group, said: 'The Bristol Liberal Democrat group brought the motion for this referendum to full council in December last year and in the spirit of cross-party working were happy to let the Green Party second the motion. 'This is a good example of working together for the good of our city and we look forward to more collaboration in future and under a fairer system.' Councillor Mark Weston, leader of the Conservative group, said: 'The mayoral model has proven a disaster for Bristol - too much power at the whim of one individual. The public have rejected this unaccountable model of government. We now need all parties to work together to bring in a more conciliatory form of politics to Bristol.' Ms Sturgeon has frequently used SNP election successes to back up her 'mandate' for another independence poll. The Scottish Tories were braced for 'heavy losses' and expected to finish third behind the SNP and Labour, as part of their worst election result in Scotland in at least a decade. There were concerns Conservative supporters in Scotland failed to turn out due to anger at the PM and Downing Street parties.  In Northern Ireland - where voters are electing Assembly members - counting will also begin this morning, but the state of the parties may not be clear until tomorrow. There is an expectation that Sinn Fein could be on the brink of a historic election victory in Northern Ireland and become the largest party for the first time. Such a result - from an election dominated by questions about Brexit issues and suggestions of an Irish reunification poll - would raise fresh concerns for the future of power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. Labour chair Anneliese Dodds was downbeat about her party's chances of picking up a swathe of new council seats.  'It's going to be a long night and there will be ups and downs - we hold the majority of the seats up for election in England, so never expected big gains, 'she said. 'These results will show the progress we have made thanks to Keir's leadership since the disastrous 2019 election result.  'Labour is a renewed and confident party, making headway in England, Scotland and Wales. 'As we have shown throughout this campaign: Labour is your side, and we have the plan to deliver the security, prosperity, and respect that the British people deserve.'  Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey predicted his party would 'gain ground in areas across the Blue Wall where voters are fed up of being taken for granted by the Conservatives'. 'After knocking on hundreds of doors this election one thing is clear: people are sick of Boris Johnson's Conservatives,' he said. 'They have had enough of seeing their taxes hiked, sewage dumped in their rivers and local health services run into the ground. 'People deserve a strong local champion who will stand up for their community, and a government that helps them with the cost of living emergency.' Elections guru Professor Michael Thrasher said that Labour would need to poll 'as well as, if not better' than 2018 in its traditional heartland councils if it is to unseat the Conservatives at the next general election. He told Sky News that Labour was 'really trying to defend a very high position' in many areas, but added it was 'also trying to stop the rot that set into the party' in the 2019 and 2021 local elections. Prof Thrasher said that growing the vote share was important for Labour, adding: 'In places like for example Barnsley, Sandwell, which are normally very reliable for the Labour party, their vote share fell in the council elections in both 2019 and 2021, so it is really important for Labour to recover the position that they had in 2018. 'They have to poll as well as, if not better, in these kinds of places if they are to demonstrate any chance of unseating the Conservative at the next general election.' The prospect of Mr Johnson being forced out of Number 10 over the local election results was gleefully seized upon by Dominic Cummings, the PM's estranged former chief aide, yesterday. The ex-No10 adviser made a sensational polling day plea for voters to force 'regime change' as he launched a blistering attack on the 'intellectually, politically, and organisationally rancid' Tories. Referring to Mr Johnson as 'the trolley' and a 'clown' in a Twitter tirade, Mr Cummings claimed it was 'irrational' for Tories to 'prop up' the PM any more. Earlier yesterday, Mr Johnson appeared in good spirits as he visited Methodist Central Hall in Westminster to cast his vote.  In a selfie video posted on social media afterwards, Mr Johnson appealed for people to focus on their local Tory candidates. 'It is Conservatives who deliver,' he said. 'It is Conservatives who get the bins collected, fill in pot holes... ' Sir Keir and his wife cast their ballots in the local elections for Camden Council at a polling station in Kentish Town, north London. As well as Partygate, the Tories have been hit with a string of controversies, including former Wakefield MP Imran Nasir Ahmad Khan being found guilty of sexually assaulting a teenage boy and veteran MP Neil Parish quitting after admitting he watched pornography in the House of Commons. Sir Keir said the Government had broken the Covid regulations they had put in place 'over and over again' and said the Tory 'failure' to tackle the cost of living crisis had been a 'disgrace', along with the Chancellor's decision to hike national insurance last month. However, the Labour leader has also been struggling to fend off questions about his own alleged lockdown breach, amid claims he ordered PS200 of curry for up to 30 aides at around 10pm during a visit to Durham last year. He was pictured drinking beer at the gathering, but insists his team were working. The Scottish Tories were braced for 'heavy losses' and expected to suffer their worst election result in Scotland in at least a decade. There were concerns Conservative supporters in Scotland failed to turn out due to anger at the PM and Downing Street parties. A senior Scottish Tory source said: 'The phones have been bad, very bad. It looks like we are going to suffer fairly heavy losses and we fully expect to finish third. Tory voters are not going to Labour, but a lot of them are staying at home because of Boris and Partygate. We expect it to be a poor election for us, our worst election in a decade or more.' However, despite the expectation of a gloomy result, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross was ready to insist he will not stand down. A source close to Mr Ross said: 'Douglas is going nowhere, he is definitely not resigning. Voters have sent a message to Boris, not Douglas. 'He is fully focused on the long term job here: the next Westminster and Scottish Parliament elections.' The local election battlegrounds that could decide the PM's fate  Here are some of the key contests to look out for in each region of England, as well as in Wales and Scotland. North-west England Bury - estimated declaration time, 8.30pm Friday May 6 Bury has all of its 51 seats up for grabs this year. Labour has run the council since 2011 but has only a small majority and will want to improve its position in what is the party's traditional heartland of Greater Manchester. Bury's status in this year's elections was reflected by the fact Sir Keir and Mr Johnson both visited the town during the campaign. (E) Bolton - 12.30am Friday May 6 Bolton is another key test for Labour in Greater Manchester, but here it is hoping to take back control from the Conservatives who have run a minority administration since 2019. A third of the council's 60 seats are being contested. (12.30am) Pendle - 4.30pm Friday, May 6 Pendle is being defended by the Conservatives, who won a slim majority last year. If the Tories lose two seats, the council will slip back into no overall control. Elections are taking place for 12 of the 33 seats. (4.30pm) Cumberland and Westmorland & Furness - 1pm Friday, May 6  Two new unitary authorities that will elect councillors for the first time this year. The two authorities cover the whole of Cumbria. Cumberland is comprised of the former district councils of Allerdale, Carlisle and Copeland, while Westmorland & Furness covers Barrow-in-Furness, Eden and South Lakeland. All the main parties will be jostling for prominence in these new 'super-councils' and the outcome in both contests could be close. (Cumberland 2.30am, Westmorland & Furness 1pm) North-east England Sunderland - 2am Friday, May 6 Run by Labour since 1973, but both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have made advances in Sunderland in recent years. A third of the council's 75 seats are up for grabs this year, and if Labour suffers six or more losses it will lose overall control. Although Sunderland is part of Labour's so-called 'Red Wall' - areas of the country that saw many Tory gains at the 2019 general election - all three Sunderland MPs are Labour and the party defied predictions in 2021 when it retained its majority on the council.  Hartlepool - 2am Friday, May 6  The Conservatives and Labour are fighting to be in with a chance of taking overall control of the council - or failing that, end up the largest party and lead a minority administration or a coalition. The Tories won the parliamentary seat of Hartlepool from Labour at a by-election in May 2021. A strong showing by independent candidates could spice up the outcome of this year's contest. Some 13 of the council's 36 seats are being contested. Yorkshire & the Humber Kirklees - 6.30pm Friday, May 6 Currently run by Labour but the party does not have a majority in Kirklees. A third of seats are being elected and just two gains by Labour would give it overall control. Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are also hoping to do well.  Wakefield - 5pm Friday, May 6 A Labour stronghold and is not likely to change hands, but the party will be hoping for a solid performance ahead of the expected parliamentary by-election in the city later this year, after Conservative MP Imran Khan was convicted of sexual assault. A third of seats are being contested.  Hull - 3.30am Friday, May 6  Hull is a two-way fight between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Labour's majority has been whittled away in recent years and the party goes into this year's election defending a majority of one. A third of the council's seats are in play and the Lib Dems are hopeful of victory. (3.30am) West Midlands Dudley - 4am Friday, May 6 A crucial test for both the Conservatives and Labour. The Tories hope to build on the slim majority they secured at the 2021 local elections, while Labour will want to halt the blue advance and make gains themselves. A third of the council is up for grabs. (4am) Solihull - 1pm Friday May 6 Another West Midlands metropolitan council under Conservative control, but the main opposition is the Greens. The party has been slowly eating into the Tories' majority and will hope to take a few more bites this year. One third of Solihull's seats are being contested. Nuneaton & Bedworth - 4am Friday May 6 Dominated by the Conservatives after a bumper performance in last year's elections. Labour will hope to demonstrate it is making a comeback, having controlled the council as recently as 2018. Half of the 34 seats are holding ballots. Newcastle-under-Lyme - 3pm Friday May 6 Set to be a battle royal between Labour and the Conservatives, with every council seat up for grabs and the Tories defending a tiny majority. Success here for Labour would suggest the party is winning back support in one of its target areas of country. The parliamentary seat of Newcastle-under-Lyme was won by the Conservatives in 2019 after being held by Labour for the previous 100 years.  East Midlands Derby - 5am Friday May 6 Derby is currently run by the Tories as a minority party. Labour will be looking to make gains in another test of party's ability to win back support in urban areas of central England. An unknown factor is the popularity of the Reform Derby party, based on the former Brexit Party, which is standing candidates in all the seats being contested. There are 17 of the council's 51 seats up for grabs.  Eastern England St Albans - 4pm Friday May 6 St Albans saw the Liberal Democrats make enough gains in 2021 to take overall control, but with a slim majority. The party will want to improve its numbers this year as an example of how it is now the main opposition to the Conservatives in parts of the so-called 'Blue Wall' of southern England. The entire council is up for election. (4pm) Peterborough - 2.30am Friday May 6  A long-running Conservative-Labour battleground and for decades the council has see-sawed between a Tory majority and no overall control. It is currently run by a minority Conservative administration and Labour will want to make gains to show it is recovering in a city it lost to the Tories at the 2019 general election. A third of seats are being contested.  Basildon - 1am Friday May 6 This Essex battleground could provide clues to how the Conservatives are doing in the commuter belt around London. The party won control of the council last year and will hope to consolidate its position in elections for a third of its 42 seats.  Stevenage - 2.30am Friday, May 6 A commuter-heavy area in Hertfordshire, but this time it is Labour who will be hoping to make progress. The party has controlled the council continuously since its creation in 1973 but will want to show it can reverse the losses it made last year. A third of the seats are up for grabs.  London Barnet - 7am Friday May 6 Labour's top target in London for the third election in a row. The party failed narrowly to win control in 2014, while 2018 saw the council swing further towards the Conservatives, with local Labour members blaming the row over antisemitism in the national party. Labour needs to gain nine seats to form a majority. As with every council in London, all seats are being elected.  Wandsworth - 5.30am Friday May 6 Another long-standing Labour target, but here the party managed to increased its number of councillors in both 2014 and 2018. The Tories have held the council since 1978 and have made a point of charging residents one of the lowest average levels of council tax in the country, so a Labour victory would be of symbolic significance.  Hillingdon - 4am Friday May 6  This borough contains the constituency of the Prime Minister and has been controlled by the Conservatives since 2006. Labour is hoping to make gains, but the outcome is hard to predict as the size of the council is being cut from 65 to 53 seats. Westminster - 3am Friday May 6 A flagship borough held by the Tories continuously since its creation in 1964. But Labour has slowly increased its number of councillors at recent elections and will want to make more progress this time. Given the current volatile political climate, plus a reduction in the size of the council from 60 to 54 seats, the final result could be close.  Harrow - 5pm Friday May 6  A council where the reduction in the number of seats from 63 to 55 could work in either Labour or the Conservatives' favour. Labour won a narrow majority in both 2014 and 2018 but the borough's electoral districts have been substantially redrawn for 2022 and both parties could profit from the new-look map.  Sutton - 4am Friday May 6 A Liberal Democrat-Conservative battleground that has been run by the Lib Dems since 1990. The party should retain control again this year, but the Tories will hope to make gains and chip away at the Lib Dems' small overall majority.  South-east England Crawley - 2pm Friday, May 6 Has tilted between Conservative and Labour control in recent years but neither party has an overall majority. It would take only a couple of gains for either the Tories or Labour to take full control of a council deep in the commuter belt of West Sussex. A third of seats are being contested.  Gosport - 5pm Friday May 6 The council sees the Conservatives, who have only a small majority, under pressure from the second-place Lib Dems. All the seats are up for grabs and boundary changes across the borough means the outcome will be even more unpredictable.  Worthing - 2pm Friday May 6 A top Labour target and the party goes into the election level-pegging with the Conservatives on 17 seats each. The Tories currently run the council as a minority administration but Labour has made steady gains in recent years and is hoping to take full control this year. A third of seats are being elected. Southampton - 5am Friday May 6 Another Labour target and winning control from the Conservatives would help demonstrate the party is building back support in southern towns and cities. The Tories are defending a majority of two and a third of the seats are being contested.  South-west England Somerset - 4pm Friday May 6 Undergoing major changes this year in its system of local government. Until now the area has had a county council and four district councils (Mendip, Sedgemoor, South Somerset and Somerset West & Taunton) but these are being scrapped and replaced with a single unitary authority. Elections are taking place for all 110 seats in the new-look organisation, with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats fighting for control.  Wales Blaenau Gwent - 3pm Friday, May 6 This council has been run by a group of independents since 2017, some of whom used to be in the Labour Party. Labour is keen to take back control and might be helped by a reduction in the number of seats from 42 to 33.  Cardiff - 5pm Friday May 6 A key council for Labour, where the party will hope to defend its slim majority. The number of councillors is being increased slightly from 75 to 79, which might make the outcome more unpredictable.  Flintshire - 3pm Friday May 6  Sits in an area of Wales, the north east, where the Conservatives did well at the 2019 general election. The party won only six council seats in 2017 compared with Labour's 34, so they are hoping to make an advance this year. For its part, Labour will want to remain the largest party and even win a majority, although the total number of seats is being cut from 70 to 67. Scotland Aberdeenshire - 3pm Friday May 6 A Conservative stronghold, but like many councils in Scotland, power is shared between several parties. All councils in Scotland are elected using the single transferable vote (STV) system, where voters rank candidates and results are based on preferences rather than the winner-takes-all method used in England. This leads to many councils ending in no overall control, but encourages parties to work together either informally or as part of a coalition. The Tories have run Aberdeenshire in partnership with the Lib Dems and a group of Independents. Their success this year may hinge on the popularity in Scotland of the Tories' UK leader Mr Johnson. East Renfrewshire - 2pm Friday May 6 A three-way battle between the Conservatives, Labour and the SNP with each hoping to end up the largest party.  Edinburgh - 3.30pm Friday May 6 The council has been run by a joint SNP-Labour administration for the last five years, but the Conservatives head into this election as the largest party on the council. The Lib Dems and Greens have a smaller number of councillors but both will hope to make gains from the larger parties.  Glasgow - 4pm Friday May 6  The council has been run by the SNP since 2017 in what has been their first stint in control of the city, albeit as a minority administration. The party needs only a few gains to take full control, but Labour - which had previously run the city since 1980 - is keen to stop them.",
    "dc4bcb865bed55ab0ab199a669a269e8e5b14e86f1d1dac957217014": "A council leader has resigned from the Conservative Party after accusing the government of 'ignoring' his county. Oliver Hemsley says he will continue leading Rutland County Council as an independent after announcing his resignation from the Conservative Group shortly after local election polls closed.  Mr Hemsley said inequalities in Rutland have been 'compounded year-on-year' because of council tax and accused the government of 'ignoring and sidelining' the council despite repeated requests for help.  The next elections for Rutland County Council won't take place until next year, though the Lib Dems won one seat being contested on Thursday.  Meanwhile, Marc Bayliss, the Tory leader of Worcester City Council, told reporters he was heading home early from the election count and is anticipating a disastrous night for his party.   Mr Bayliss blamed partygate and said the public had found the government's performance 'wanting'.  He added: 'I think it is fair to say we are having a bad night.'  His comments were echoed by the leader of the Conservatives on Sunderland Council, Antony Mullen, who called for Boris Johnson to step down. He told the BBC: 'It's been Partygate - it's suppressed our turnout. Quite clearly that's the only thing that has changed nationally that has affected this 'The best chance of reviving the Conservative Party's fortunes will be with a new leader. 'If there is no improvement in the party's reputation, then clearly something has to change.' Conservative leader of Carlisle City Council John Mallinson urged Tory MPs to decide whether they wanted Mr Johnson to lead them into the next general election. He told Sky News the PM 'must shoulder an awful lot of the blame' for a poor local elections performance and described how Partygate and the cost-of-living crisis were key concerns of voters. Mr Mallinson said there was a feeling among the public that 'the Government are not in touch and, sadly I have to say, the PM cannot be relied upon to be telling the truth'. He said he expected Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Tory 1922 Committee, to soon receive more letters of no confidence in Mr Johnson from MPs. The councillor added: 'Whether it gets to 54 or not (the number of letters needed to trigger a confidence vote in the PM), I'm not sure. But I rather feel that's they way it's going.' Simon Bosher, the Conservative group leader on Portsmouth City Council, said: 'Those in power in Westminster really do need to take a good hard look in the mirror. 'Because it's the rank-and-file grassroots members who they rely on who are actually losing their seats tonight.' He also called on the PM to reflect on the Tories' local election performance as he hit out at 'too many mistakes, too many mismanged situations' from the party's leadership. A downbeat Boris Johnson admitted the Tories will have their 'a*** kicked' in the local elections as Cabinet ministers prepare fresh efforts to keep him in Number 10. As polling stations closed last night and vote counting began, the Conservatives were braced to lose hundreds of councillors around the country. This was despite hopes their support might hold up in Red Wall areas. The PM was said to be pessimistic about his party's chances of avoiding a drubbing, with the BBC reporting he yesterday told aides ahead of ballot papers being counted: 'We are going to get our a*** kicked tonight.' Flagship councils such as Wandsworth - the London borough that was famously Margaret Thatcher's favourite - and possibly Westminster were set to slip from Conservative control. The Tories were also facing the prospect of being booted out of power in West Oxfordshire. A dismal set of local election results will ratchet up the pressure on Mr Johnson's position in Downing Street in the wake of the Partygate scandal. But allies of the PM are preparing a counter-offensive in case rebel Tories seek to use bruising results as an excuse to pounce. They will try to soothe nerves among backbenchers by arguing the PM has got the 'big calls right' and is the best person to navigate the economy through 'choppy water ahead'. A Cabinet source said: 'Boris delivered Brexit, got us through Covid, and is now right at the front of the global response to the invasion of Ukraine. 'He is absolutely the right leader to take Britain forward.'",
    "53098531383bd51f10a38fed6413efcec498dcb11ab14a58ea6b64af": "A credit ratings agency has predicted a spike in mortgage defaults will particularly hit Australians in the outer suburbs of the big cities when interest rates keep rising.  The Reserve Bank of Australia's 0.25 percentage point increase last Tuesday - ending the era of the record-low 0.1 per cent cash rate - is far from the last, with new hints of a lot more pain for borrowers. Two big banks - ANZ and Westpac - are expecting the RBA to raise rates seven more times by May 2023, which would take the cash rate to 2.25 per cent for the first time in eight years. A 2.15 percentage point rise in a year would mark the fastest annual surge in the cash rate since 1994 - with maps showing the areas most at risk of mortgage delinquencies throughout the country. The RBA on Friday suggested the cash rate could rise even higher to 2.5 per cent next year to keep a lid on surging inflation.   Headline inflation in the year to March surged by 5.1 per cent, the fastest pace since 2001, but the RBA has released new forecasts, predicting it will reach 6 per cent by the end of 2022 for the first time in two decades.  In little more than a year, inflation would have doubled as the global supply chain crisis really bites in Australia.  'Sources of inflation are broadening. Firms are increasingly passing on cost increases as supply chain pressures have persisted and demand has remained strong,' the RBA said in its statement on monetary policy, referencing inflation 193 times. * SYDNEY: Suburbs in the south-west including Liverpool (postcode 2170) and Cabramatta (postcode 2166); Blacktown (postcode 2148); the outer south-west covering Campbelltown (postcode 2560) and the Central Coast covering Gosford (postcode 2250) * MELBOURNE: Suburbs in the north-west including Broadmeadows (postcode 3047) * BRISBANE: Suburbs in Logan (postcode 4114) * PERTH: Suburbs in the north-east like Red Hill (postcode 6056) 'Inflation in Australia remains lower than in many other advanced economies, but it has picked up faster and to a higher level than previously expected.' Even the underlying measure of inflation, taking out huge price increases like petrol, is on the high side, with the RBA expecting it to hit 4.75 per cent by the end of 2022 - a level well above the central bank's 2 to 3 per cent target.  This is sure to mean even more pain for both borrowers and consumers.  Credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service said a series of rate rises would make it harder for many borrowers to repay their loans and cause a fall in real estate values. 'The central bank's rate rises will push up floating-rate mortgage interest rates, which will worsen borrowers' capacity to repay debt and increase the risk of delinquencies and defaults,' vice president Alena Chen said. 'Interest rate rises will pose the most risk for mortgages with high balances and those where repayment amounts are close to borrowers' maximum repayment capacity.' Moody's feared a fall in property prices would see struggling borrowers owe more than their property was worth, a situation known as negative equity where they can't sell their home to repay their debt. 'Interest rate rises will also weigh on house prices, which will add to risks of home loan delinquencies and defaults because of a weakening housing market will make it harder for borrowers in financial trouble to sell their properties at high enough prices to repay their debt,' it said. Last year, Australian property prices climbed by 22 per cent - the fastest annual pace since 1989.  The proportion of borrowers who are 30 days or more behind on their repayments has previously risen when interest rates have gone up and Moody's is expecting that to happen again. This would be particularly so in suburbs that already have higher mortgage delinquency rates, including pockets of south-west and western Sydney, northern Melbourne, Logan south of Brisbane and Perth's north-east. 'Mortgage delinquency rates in Australia, which decreased in most states and territories in 2021, will increase moderately over the rest of 2022 because of rising interest rates and slowing property prices,' Moody's said. Within a year, Australians with an average mortgage of $600,000 could see their monthly repayments surge by $713 to $3,019 should the cash rate hit 2.25 per cent. This would see variable mortgage rates rise from 2.29 per cent to 4.44 per cent. Variable mortgage rates are set to rise to 2.54 per cent in coming weeks, following the rise in the RBA cash rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.35 per cent.  The RBA's May rise was the first since November 2010. But Moody's Investors Service data from the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 showed home loan delinquencies rose in many outer-suburban areas that traditionally suffer from higher mortgage stress.   Sydney's south-west - covering Liverpool (postcode 2170) and Cabramatta (postcode 2166)  - was particularly vulnerable during previous interest rate rises, with the proportion of borrowers falling behind on their repayments increasing from 2.62 per cent in 2006 to 3.68 per cent in 2008 as the RBA cash rate increased from 5.5 per cent to 7.25 per cent.  1994: Reserve Bank cash rate rose by 2.75 percentage points from 4.75 per cent to 7.5 per cent between August and December Annual inflation doubled from 2 per cent in September quarter of 1994 to 5.1 per cent by September quarter of 1995 2022: Westpac and ANZ are expecting the RBA cash rate to rise by 2.15 percentage points from a record-low of 0.1 per cent to 2.25 per cent Inflation in March quarter was 5.1 per cent - fastest annual pace in 21 years - but the RBA is expecting it to hit 6 per cent by December for the first time in two decades That would represent a doubling of inflation in little more than a year - with the consumer price index sitting at 3 per cent in the September quarter of 2021  Mortgage delinquencies stayed high at 3.13 per cent in 2011 after the RBA raised the cash rate in late 2010 to 4.75 per cent, following a series of rises starting in 2009 as inflation climbed again. This region of Sydney had the city's highest arrears rate of 1.87 per cent in November 2021, before the banks put up their fixed mortgage rates.  During that time, Blacktown (postcode 2148) in western Sydney saw its mortgage delinquency rate rise from 1.64 per cent in 2006 to 2.96 per cent in 2008, and hitting 3.09 per cent in 2011, after the 2010 RBA rate rise. Its arrears rate of 1.24 per cent at the end of last year was among the highest in Sydney and more than double the delinquency level of the upmarket North Shore and Northern Beaches.  Blacktown's median house price of $914,350 in April, based on CoreLogic data, is beyond the reach of an average income earner. With a 20 per cent deposit, a typical full-time worker on $90,917 would have a debt-to-income ratio of eight. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority deems six to be the mortgage stress threshold.  In neighbouring Seven Hills, the median house price has risen above $1million.  Even before the rate rise, housing advocacy group Everybody's Home and Digital Finance Analytics identified western and south-west Sydney as the worst areas for mortgage stress.  Melbourne also had pockets of mortgage stress, with delinquencies in the city's north-west - taking in Broadmeadows (postcode 3047) - rising from 1.32 per cent in 2006 to 2.1 per cent in 2007 and 2.28 per cent by 2011. WESTPAC: 2.25 per cent cash rate by May 2023 NAB: 2.6 per cent cash rate by August 2024 ANZ: 2.25 per cent by May 2023 COMMONWEALTH BANK: 1.6 per cent by February 2023 Source: RateCity  The 1.65 per cent level late last year was Melbourne's highest. Mandurah (postcode 6210) south of Perth was particularly affected as the mining boom pushed up house prices with Moody's data showing mortgage delinquencies rising from 0.3 per cent in 2006 to 1.91 per cent in 2008 and 4.11 per cent in 2011. But its arrears rate of 1.58 per cent is now comparable with the rest of Perth. Perth's north-east covering Red Hill (postcode 6056) now has the city's highest delinquency rate of 2.04 per cent.  Logan (postcode 4114) south of Brisbane also had a big jump in arrears, which doubled from 0.75 per cent to 1.5 per cent from 2006 to 2008, before hitting 2.66 per cent in 2011.  The 1.18 per cent rate in November 2021 was among the highest in south-east Queensland. In 2021, the Coffs Harbour and Grafton region on the New South Wales Mid-North Coast had the lowest mortgage delinquency rate of 0.38 per cent while the Northern Territory Outback had the highest rate at 2.58 per cent. The Reserve Bank of Australia is expecting an increase in the cash rate to two per cent to cause a 15 per cent fall in property prices. $500,000: Monthly repayments rising by $594 from $1,922 to $2,516 $600,000: Monthly repayments rising by $713 from $2,306 to $3,019 $700,000: Monthly repayments rising by $831 from $2,691 to $3,522 $800,000: Monthly repayments rising by $951 from $3,075 to $4,026 $900,000: Monthly repayments rising by $1,070 from $3,459 to $4,529 $1,000,000: Monthly repayments rising by $1,189 from $3,843 to $5,032 Calculations based on variable mortgage rates rising from 2.29 to 4.44 per cent in line with the cash rate increasing by 2.15 percentage points from a record-low of 0.1 per cent to 2.25 per cent",
    "0a22b1b0a1e33b108cd2a0e12d61ff76ba0bd6c813e7fdb23a91dd8f": "NATO must ensure Vladimir Putin suffers a 'huge personal cost' if he dares to expand his Ukrainian invasion to other nations, the Royal Navy chief warned. Admiral Sir Ben Key, the First Sea Lord, said it is key for NATO nations to 'contain' the war in Ukraine so that it does not 'accelerate away from us'. His warning comes as there is mounting fear Putin could expand his invasion into Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria, an unrecognised Moscow-backed sliver of land bordering southwestern Ukraine. There are also fears of Russian interference in Sweden after the country announced it is considering applying for NATO membership, prompting NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to say the alliance could heighten its presence around the nation to protect it from any aggression.  Sir Ben told The Daily Telegraph: 'The lessons of history would say that we are in a particularly fragile moment right now. '[This] is why it's really important that while the support we are giving to Ukraine at the moment is to enable them, we have to show a robust a resilient posture across the rest of the contact line with Russia, wherever that is, at sea, in the air, the rest of the NATO landmass, so that Mr Putin understands that this is not something that he can broaden without a huge cost to him and Russia.' Sir Ben, who led the UK's airlift of British citizens and Afghans from Kabul after the Taliban takeover, accused Putin of committing an 'egregious wrong' against Ukraine. The First Sea Lord urged the UK to continue to send weapons to Ukraine so that their troops can 'defend their territory, their homeland and their people'. But Sir Ben said that whilst the aim of doing so is for Putin to 'desist' from his invasion, he admitted that outcome is 'a long way away at the moment'. Sir Ben also said it was imperative for the navies of NATO nations must remain a  deterrent position to 'counter Putin's actions and dissuade him from doing more'. 'We represent a threat,' the Navy chief said. 'The Russians effectively tried to exclude any other ships from operating in the northern part of the Black Sea, and the Ukrainians demonstrated that was not something that they could do freely.' Sir Ben warned 'ships become valid targets' during war, and the UK must be prepared for any attacks.  'That requires for our posture to be correct, for our capabilities to be properly aligned, for us to be modernising and adapting to seeing what others can do and what technology opportunity offers us,' he said. His comments comes as NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance must guarantee Sweden's security if it decides to join NATO. 'We must remember that from the moment Sweden potentially applies, and NATO says that it wants Sweden to join, there is a very strong NATO obligation to guarantee Sweden's security', Stoltenberg told Swedish public television SVT. 'We have several ways of doing that, among other things with a heightened presence of NATO and NATO forces around Sweden and the Baltic Sea', he said. In a historic turnaround sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Sweden and Finland - two militarily non-aligned countries - are considering applying for NATO membership. A decision is expected in each country in the coming days or weeks. An expansion of the Atlantic alliance is likely to anger Moscow, which has warned of 'consequences' if the Nordic neighbours apply. One of the most pressing questions is the two countries' security during an application process - which can take months as each of the 30 NATO member states must ratify any membership bid. Only full members benefit from NATO's Article 5, its cornerstone principle that an attack on one member is an attack on all members. Stockholm and Helsinki have in recent weeks held talks with several major NATO powers to obtain 'security assurances'. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin on Thursday said discussions had already been held with the France, Germany, the UK and the United States, and stressed that a speedy ratification process would be 'would be the best security guarantee'. Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde, who on Thursday wrapped up a visit to Canada and the United States, said Tuesday in Washington that the United States was prepared to provide 'different kinds of security assurances' during the application process. A spokesman for the US National Security Council said he was 'confident' a solution could be found. There are also fears that Russia will expand its war and invade Moldova's separatist region of Transnistria.  Russia has been accused of planning hybrid attacks to 'destabilise' the region and Moldova's pro-Western government after a series of explosions there prompted fears of Russia launching 'false flag' attacks to justify invading Transnistria. Ukrainian and Moldovan officials have warned that Russia is planning the hybrid attacks in Moldova that would mix both conventional attacks and novel forms of warfare as well as terrorist acts including indiscriminate violence and criminal disorder.  Last month, Kremlin military chief Rustam Minnekayev said Russia sought control of southern Ukraine, which could provide access to Transnistria, 'where there have been cases of oppression of the Russian-speaking population'.  It has prompted growing alarm in the small European nation of 3.5 million people that they will be pulled into the war. If they were, it would put pressure on the West to intervene given the country's close relationship with NATO and EU member Romania. Transnistria, a strip of land with about 470,000 people between Moldova and Ukraine, is recognised internationally as part of Moldova but is effectively controlled by Russia, which has given citizenship to separatists.  An estimated 1,500 Russian troops are permanently stationed in the Transnistria, but concerns are high that the region could be used as a launch pad for new attacks on Ukraine. Ukraine's General Staff yesterday noted Russian efforts to stir tensions in Transnistria.  The Russian military 'carries out regrouping of troops in certain areas, takes measures to replenish reserves' and is 'trying to improve the tactical position of its units,' the General Staff said.",
    "edf7b6635f595134b08fb172196ef308d58799fdb02e3b4e7592f2c6": "Desperate Vladimir Putin has ordered his troops on a bloody mission to seize the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol so he can have a victory to gloat over during celebrations in Russia next week, British intelligence believes. Heavy fighting has now been going on inside the sprawling industrial complex - the last holdout of Ukrainian defenders in the key Black Sea port city - for three days, despite Putin going on Russian state TV just two weeks ago to publicly call off the operation to 'preserve the lives and health of our soldiers and officers.' The assault is thought to be linked to May 9 Victory Day celebrations in Russia, when the country marks the surrender of Nazi Germany at the end of the Second World War and which Putin typically uses for a chest-beating display of Russian patriotism and military might complete with parades and flag-waving crowds. Russian commanders have decided to pour men into the complex, despite the heavy casualties they will inevitably suffer, because of 'the upcoming 9 May Victory Day commemorations and Putin's desire to have a symbolic success in Ukraine', the UK's Ministry of Defence said today. 'Whilst Ukrainian resistance continues in Azovstal, Russian losses will continue to build and frustrate their operational plans in southern Donbas,' an intelligence update from the MoD added. But it is far from certain that the Russian assault can succeed in time. Azovstal is vast: Four square miles of factory buildings, warehouses, elevated walkways and tight alleys that sits on top of a nuclear-bomb-proof network of tunnels where up to 2,000 Ukrainian defenders are holed up alongside hundreds of civilians. Victory Day - May 9 - is a public holiday in Russia that marks the surrender of Nazi Germany that ended the Second World War in Europe. Inaugurated in 1945, it did not become a public holiday until 1965 and even then was only celebrated in some of the Soviet republics. The holiday gained some level of prominence under Boris Yeltsin, the first Russian President after the Soviet Union dissolved, but the holiday in its current form can be largely credited to Vladimir Putin. Under his leadership, the day has been turned from a solemn time of remembrance for the estimated 27million Soviets who died during the war into a chest-beating show of nationalist pride and military prowess. Aside from wreath-laying at war memorials, the day is now known for huge military parades including one which passes through Moscow's Red Square - usually under the watchful eye of Putin himself. In past years, the despotic leader has used the parade to showcase Russia's latest military technology in the form of upgraded tanks and new missiles - particularly nukes. This year is expected to be no different, but Putin also is expected to use the event to praise his army's efforts in fighting Ukraine and to drum up support for the invasion which has so-far met with embarrassing defeats. That has led to speculation that he may use the event to officially declare war on Ukraine, upgrading the conflict from a 'special military operation', which would provide a pre-text for mobilising Russia's military reserves in order to throw more men into the fight. Others believe he may try to cut his losses and prematurely declare the campaign over, with victory achieved, though it is unclear exactly how that would work since Ukraine will continue to fight and Putin will need a way to explain the body bags that keep arriving back in Russia. Perhaps the likeliest option is that he will say Russia has achieved great success on the battlefield but Ukraine's 'Nazi' problem runs deeper than at first thought, meaning the war must continue. A symbolic victory - such as seizing Mariupol - would make this lie easier to sell. The last time Russia invaded Ukraine, in 2014, Putin used Victory Day to fly to the newly-occupied Crimea and visit Russia's main naval base at Sevastopol, where he was greeted by large crowds. Such a move is unlikely this time around, out of fear that Ukraine will try to kill him during such a visit.  Ukrainian commanders - giving daily updates from inside the plant - say they are continuing to hold the line despite 'bloody fighting' in 'extremely difficult' conditions, and have begged the Russians to call off the assault so that the wounded and civilians can be evacuated. Oleksiy Arestovych, a top adviser to President Zelesnky, said on Thursday that the defenders had successfully pushed the Russians out of the complex amid heavy clashes - allowing a UN mission to go in on Friday morning to evacuate some of the people trapped there. Andriy Yermak, head of the presidential staff, said some 500 civilians had been rescued as of Friday morning which included people from Azovstal and the wider city. It is thought they will be taken through Russian-controlled territory to the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia, following in the footsteps of an earlier evacuation. Amid Russian assaults on the plant, the wife of one commander spoke out late Thursday to say that he will  'stand till the end' and 'will never surrender'. Kateryna Prokopenko, who is married to Azov Battalion leader Denys Prokopenko, made the remarks after speaking to her husband on the phone as he made a last stand at the plant. 'It seemed like words of goodbye,' she said afterwards. 'I am going mad from this.'  The Ukrainian military's General Staff said Friday that 'the blockade of units of the defense forces in the Azovstal area continues' and that the Russians, with aviation support, had resumed assault operations to take control of the sprawling plant. 'There are many wounded (fighters), but they are not surrendering,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. 'They are holding their positions.' 'Just imagine this hell! And there are children there,' he said. 'More than two months of constant shelling, bombing, constant death.' The Russians managed to get inside the plant Wednesday with the help of an electrician who knew the layout, said Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry. 'He showed them the underground tunnels which are leading to the factory,' Gerashchenko said in a video. Zelenskyy said the attack was preventing evacuation of the remaining civilians, even as U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said another attempt was underway. 'We must continue to do all we can to get people out of these hellscapes,' Guterres said. The Kremlin denied its troops were storming the plant and has demanded the Ukrainians surrender. They have refused. Russia has also accused the fighters of preventing the civilians from leaving. The fall of Mariupol would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, allow Russia to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to fight elsewhere in the Donbas, the eastern industrial region that the Kremlin says is now its chief objective. Capt. Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov Regiment, pleaded on Ukrainian TV for the evacuation of civilians and wounded fighters from the steelworks, saying soldiers were 'dying in agony due to the lack of proper treatment.' More than 100 civilians were rescued from the steelworks over the weekend. But many previous attempts to open safe corridors from Mariupol have fallen through, with Ukraine blaming shelling and firing by the Russians. Meanwhile, 10 weeks into the devastating war, Ukraine's military claimed it recaptured some areas in the south and repelled other attacks in the east, further frustrating Putin's ambitions after his abortive attempt to seize Kyiv. Ukrainian and Russian forces are fighting village by village. The General Staff in Kyiv said Russian forces were conducting surveillance flights, and in the hard-hit areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, Ukrainian forces repulsed 11 attacks and destroyed tanks and armored vehicles. Russia gave no immediate acknowledgement of those losses. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Russian forces are making only 'plodding' progress in the Donbas. There are growing suggestions that Ukraine might try to widen its push to seize more territory from Russia outside of Kharkiv, its second-largest city. Ukrainian chief of defense, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said Thursday that a counteroffensive could begin to push Russian forces away from Kharkiv and Izyum, which has been a key node in Russia's control of the eastern cauldron. Ukraine in recent days has driven Russian troops some 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of Kharkiv, which has been repeatedly struck by Russian shelling. Additional Ukrainian advances may spare the city from artillery strikes, as well as force Moscow to divert troops from other areas of the front line. On Thursday, an American official said the U.S. shared intelligence with Ukraine about the location of a Russian flagship before the mid-April strike that sank it, one of Moscow's highest-profile failures in the war. The U.S. has provided 'a range of intelligence' that includes locations of warships, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said the decision to target the missile cruiser Moskva was purely a Ukrainian decision. Fearful of new attacks surrounding Victory Day, the mayor of the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk urged residents to leave for the countryside over the long weekend and warned them not to gather in public places. And the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, a key transit point for evacuees from Mariupol, announced a curfew from Sunday evening through Tuesday morning. Mariupol, which had a prewar population of over 400,000, has come to symbolize the misery inflicted by the war. The siege of the city has trapped perhaps 100,000 civilians with little food, water, medicine or heat. As the battle raged there, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian bombardment Thursday hit dozens of Ukrainian military targets, including troop concentrations in the east, an artillery battery near the eastern settlement of Zarozhne and rocket launchers near the southern city of Mykolaiv. The war has devastated Ukraine's medical infrastructure, Zelenskyy said in a video link to a charity event in the U.K. Nearly 400 health care facilities have been damaged or destroyed, he said. 'There is simply a catastrophic situation regarding access to medical services and medicines,' in areas occupied by Russian forces, he said. 'Even the simplest drugs are lacking.' With the challenge of mine-clearing and rebuilding after the war in mind, Zelenskyy announced the launch of a global fundraising platform called United24. At the same time, Poland hosted an international donor conference that raised $6.5 billion in humanitarian aid. The gathering was attended by prime ministers and ambassadors from many European countries, as well as representatives of other nations and some businesses. In addition, a Ukrainian cabinet body began to develop proposals for a comprehensive postwar reconstruction plan, while Zelenskyy also urged Western allies to put forward a program similar to the post-World War II Marshall Plan plan to help Ukraine rebuild.",

    "1a1f40582d8b79c99903ff524ec8247fe83e1e02865ae245c3ba066c": "An antiques dealer may have found the bargain of the millennium after she found a priceless 2,000 year-old Roman bust - which was taken from Germany during the Second World War -  for just $35 at a Texas thrift store. Laura Young, of Austin, came across the 52-pound Roman bust at a local Goodwill store in her hometown in 2018 and didn't think twice before acting on her intuition to buy it. Busts from a similar time period have been sold for practically $30,000, online auctions suggest. 'He looked Roman. He looked old,' Young told the San Antonio Express-News. 'In the sunlight, it looked like something that could be very, very special.' Young's instinct proved to be the right one. After acquiring the sculpture, Young contacted art experts at the University of Texas at Austin, as well as collectors and auction homes around the country to get a sense of its authenticity and origin. An unknown specialist confirmed it was an ancient Roman artifact, but Sotheby's consultant Jorg Deterling was the one who resolved the era it was made in -- dating back from the late 1st century BC to the early 1st century AD. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO The bust, named 'Portrait of a Man' -- was showcased on Wednesday at the San Antonio Museum, where it will remain until May 2023. The museum piece will then travel back to Germany, where it will reappear for the first time since the end of the Second World War. 'It had once stood in the town of Aschaffenburg, Germany, in a full-scale model of a house from Pompeii, called the Pompejanum, built [by] Ludwig I of Bavaria,' the San Antonio Museum of Art said on its website.  The antique vanished after Aschaffenburg - the German city where it had stayed for decades - was heavily damaged by Allied area bombing during the Second World War, including the Pompejanum. The most likely explanation for the bust being stateside is that a US soldier returned home with it to Texas from Europe post-war, where it remained a hidden gem until four years ago.   Young said she ended up alerting the German government once it was confirmed that the antique was stolen from there. She made arrangements for the prestigious artwork to return to the Bavarian Administration of State-owned Palaces in May of next year, after art lovers from all over the country get a chance to see the bust with their own eyes.  'He'd been hidden for 70-to-80 years, I thought he deserved to be seen and studied,' Young told the Express-News. She told DailyMail.com that she couldn't comment on questions regarding potential compensation for her discovery.  Although it's never been confirmed, the bust most likely portrays Sextus Pompey. He was a Roman military leader, who throughout his life, upheld the death of his father, Pompey the Great, against Julius Caesar and his supporters during the last civil wars of the Roman Republic. Pompey the Great, Sextus' father, was killed in Egypt after he had fled Roman soil following defeat in a civil war against his former ally, Julius Caesar, who went on to become dictator of Rome from 49 BC until his assassination in 44 BC.  'It's a portrait of an outlaw, a sort of enemy of the state,' San Antonio Museum of Art curatorial fellow Lynley McAlpine told the Express News.  'It's unusual to have something like this. It's also interesting that someone preserved it and had it in their collection as a personal enemy to the emperor. That could be dangerous to display something like that,' she added.  Prior to its discovery, the last record mentioning the Roman bust is from an 1833 inventory of King Ludwig I of Bavaria's art collection. The royal stored the art piece in a model home, supposedly depicting Pompeii around the eruption of the Vesuvio during Roman times, dubbed the Pompejanum.  Young, a former state disability examiner, said she would have never come across the antique had she not gotten into the business of selling them in 2011, through her business, Temple of Vintage. 'It was really, really exciting to see him in a museum,' she said after seeing the bust for the first time on Wednesday at the San Antonio Museum of Art. 'It was kind of surreal; he had been in our living room for over three years.'  However, she still feels bittersweet about the finding.  'I liked him,' Young added. 'I got attached to him in our house, right there in the entryway. You could see his reflection on the television. He became part of the house.' The only other known portrait of Sextus Pompey is in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. ",

The blue Mercedes landed headfirst into a shed below, while its rear end remained propped up by the drivers house. Emergency services including fire crew, paramedics and police attended the incident in Torquay, Devon. The driver, an 88-year-old woman, was safely removed by the fire brigade. After stabilising the vehicle using v-struts, a winch and strops, chocks, a triple extension ladder, and small tools, fire crews managed to extricate the driver. Neighbours said the driver of vehicle had lived at the address for 40 years. One said: 'She is very independent. She's lived there for about 40 years and she's always up and down to the shops.' Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue crew manager Josh Caunter said the driver of the Mercedes was in the vehicle when they arrived on Wednesday. He said: 'We safely extricated her from the vehicle by removing the driver's door and assisting her down a ladder. 'The vehicle was an automatic Mercedes.

    "db910b90295e000cbf74dab50da38b4e3526e695805d202d6bb645e4": "Former Vice President Mike Pence fired back at his successor for remarks she made criticizing a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision as he spoke at an anti-abortion rights gala Thursday night. Pence and his successor, current Vice President Kamala Harris, are on different sides of the abortion issue - and both were asked to speak at fundraisers this past week.  Trump's former No. 2 used the current veep's words against her while headlining an event at the Carolina Pregnancy Center in South Carolina - an 'independent, faith-based nonprofit organization' whose mission is to 'help women and families with pregnancy-related issues,'  'I say with the lives of 62 million unborn boys and girls ended in abortion since 1973, generations of mothers enduring heartbreaking and loss that can last a lifetime: Madame Vice President, how dare you?'  On Tuesday, Harris spoke at a Washington gala for Emily's List, an organization that seeks to elect pro-choice women to office. At the gala, Harris slammed the conservative justices following the revelation that they were likely to overturn Roe v. Wade. 'Women in almost half the country could see their access to abortion severely limited,' if the draft opinion is adopted, Harris said, noting that in 13 states 'women would lose access to abortion immediately and outright. 'Those Republican leaders who are trying to weaponize the use of the law against women, well we say 'How dare they? How dare they tell a woman what she can do and cannot do with her own body? How dare they?' Both vice presidents' speeches come in the wake of a Politico report showing that the conservative Supreme Court majority that would put an end to the 50-year landmark abortion ruling giving women a constitutional right to terminate their pregnancies. 'Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,' Justice Samuel Alito writes in the opinion, which was penned back in February and has reportedly been circulated among the court members. 'We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,' he continues in the document, titled 'Opinion of the Court.' 'It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.' The authenticity of the draft decision was later confirmed by Chief Justice John Roberts, but it is not yet final until the court formally announces its decision in a case. That means the ruling could still be changed. Following the revelation, liberal lawmakers vowed to fight the decision, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeting Monday night that Sen. Joe Manchin is preventing a vote on codifying abortion rights into law, while Sen. Bernie Sanders suggested ending the filibuster to get it passed. And in the days since the decision was leaked pro-abortion rights activists have taken to the streets from the steps of the Supreme Court to New York City, Nevada, Texas and California to protest the draft decision. Some protesters are now planning to send activists to the homes of the conservative justices, after an activist group called 'Ruth Sent Us' published the supposed addresses of Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts  'Our 6-3 extremist Supreme Court routinely issues rulings that hurt women, racial minorities, LGBTQ+ and immigrant rights,' the group's website reads. 'We must rise up to force accountability using a diversity of tactic.' Meanwhile, tall fencing was erected around the Supreme Court on Wednesday evening amid growing clashes between pro- and anti-abortion groups. And although D.C. is ground zero for the demonstrations, law enforcement authorities across the country are preparing for possible violence and civil unrest. A February situational awareness bulletin from the Colorado Information Analysis Center warns challenges to Roe v. Wade could lead to unrest and violent incidents. 'Law enforcement and public safety officials should anticipate an increase in abortion-related events, rallies, and protests with the potential for violence and criminal activity, particularly leading up to and directly following the Supreme Court's decision in the Mississippi case,' the bulletin noted. A decision on the Mississippi case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is expected by June. For years the FBI has tracked extremists on both sides of the abortion issue. The bureau's Domestic Terrorism Reference Guide on Abortion-Related Extremists was widely circulated in November 2021 and looks at the threats stemming from both sides of the heated argument. 'Abortion-related violent extremists seek to further their pro-life or pro-choice ideologies through the threat or use of force or violence against individuals or facilities which provide services in opposition of their beliefs,' the guide notes. It adds: 'Pro-life extremists believe force or violence is necessary to save the lives of the unborn. Pro-choice extremists believe it is their moral duty to protect those who provide or receive reproductive health care services.' And while Republicans are pleased with the content of the draft opinion, they are furious over the leak, with   Chief Justice John Roberts sounding off about it in a private meeting Thursday, calling it 'absolutely appalling.'  Roberts, in remarks to judges and lawyers in Atlanta first reported by CNN,  underscored that he hoped 'one bad apple' would not change 'people's perception' of the high court.   He called the 'person' or 'people' who leaked the document 'foolish' if they thought it would sway votes on the court.  He had earlier announced an investigation into the source of the 'betrayal,' announcing Tuesday: 'I have directed the Marshal of the Court to launch an investigation into the source of the leak.' The chief justice decried the leak as an 'egregious breach' and an 'affront to the court.'   Texas Senator Ted Cruz, meanwhile, claims the Supreme Court leak is the doing of an individual 'woke left-wing twit' and claims the person responsible for the chaos unleashed in America on Monday evening should be disbarred and put in jail. 'In over 200 years of our nation's history, that has never happened,' he told Fox Primetime host Brian Kilmeade on Wednesday. 'And there was one woke little left-wing twit who decided, to hell with his or her obligations to the justice they work for, to hell with their obligations to the court, to hell with their obligations to the rule of law, that they would instead try to sneak it out in order to put political pressure on the justices and intimidate them into changing their votes,' he added. Cruz, after graduating from Harvard Law School in 1995, clerked for Judge J. Michael Luttig of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and then for the Supreme Court's Chief Justice at the time William Rehnquist from 1996 to 1997. He told Fox News on Wednesday that it's 'difficult to overstate how destructive this is to the Supreme Court.' Trump administration Attorney General Bill Barr on Wednesday called the act of leaking a bombshell Supreme Court memo an 'unforgivable sin.' Republicans argue that the leak has destroyed the sanctity of the Supreme Court, which for most of its history has remained free of political influence and partisan bickering that is more common in the executive and legislative branches. 'We're going to find this person, and when they're found, they're going to be fired on the spot, they will be disbarred if they're a member of the bar, or they will never be admitted to the bar to be a lawyer, and to the extent that they've broken criminal laws, they need to be prosecuted and sent to jail,' Cruz said.",
    "77be834790279bd89d8f7410c968871c569442d70e92583c182ad085": "A childcare worker who was one of two staff on the bus where a little girl almost died after she was left for six hours is beside herself and 'going through a tough time'. Le Smileys Early Learning Centre director Bianca Reynolds is hunkering down with her mother and sister at her home in Gracemere, in Queensland's Rockhampton region. 'This is a horrible situation for anybody,' her protective sister Emily told Daily Mail Australia. 'She's going through a really tough time.' Ms Reynolds was reportedly on the mini bus which picked up three-year-old Nevaeh Austin from her home about 9am on Wednesday morning for the school pick-up. Police are now investigating how both Ms Reynolds and her colleague came to forget about Nevaeh, who was the only child on the bus at the time. One of Ms Reynold's colleagues found Nevaeh unconscious beside her belongings on the bus when they returned about 3pm to begin drop offs. The three-year-old has improved significantly since she was transferred to Brisbane Children's hospital and has been 'giggling, squealing and eating ice cream' in hospital.  It's a miraculous recovery for a little girl who just two days ago was given 'a 5 to 10 per cent chance of survival', according to her grandmother Pamela Parker.  Ms Parker says she and the rest of Nevaeh's family now want answers as to how a task as mundane as the school round pick up could go so horribly wrong.  Ms Reynolds, a mother herself, has worked at Le Smileys for six years, starting as an apprentice fresh out of university in 2016.  A staff photograph on the wall of the reception in the daycare lists Ms Reynolds as a 'director' and 'nominated supervisor'. She is one of five staff in the picture, including the owner.   A former Le Smileys director said she hired Ms Reynolds because of her clear passion for children and their development. Ms Reynolds has always loved children and in a 2016 interview said she would care for children even when she was in primary school. She 'always knew' she would go into childcare. Police have not yet laid any charges but refuse to rule out doing so. They're still investigating the incident and returned to the childcare on Friday to conduct further testing on the van. Ms Parker said while she wouldn't want to hinder the investigation, she can't fathom what went through the minds of staff on Wednesday morning.  'You would at least on your last drop off or back to the daycare, you'd actually get in the back of the van and make sure there's no bags, toys, no bottles, certainly no children,' she said. 'That should have been first and foremost in the front of their minds, check the bus.' Neveah is in a stable condition now, breathing on her own as her grandmother is set to join her at the Queensland Children's Hospital on Friday afternoon.  Officers worked late on Thursday night to examine the van, which has been forensically tested but not yet removed from the day care centre. A child's booster seat was visible as officers took pictures from multiple angles, jotted down notes and discussed their findings among one another. A temperature recording camera appeared to be placed in the locked van at one stage. It's understood police hoped to gauge an estimate of how hot it may have been inside the van for the six hours Nevaeh was trapped inside. Temperatures peaked at 30C in Rockhampton on Thursday - just one degree warmer than it was on Wednesday. Estimates suggest the interior of a car could have reached 56C after just 2 hours in direct sunlight. As the sun set, police continued to photograph the interior and exterior of the van using a high technology 3D laser scanner to exactly replicate the conditions met by the driver, her colleague and Nevaeh on Wednesday. They paid particular attention to the glass windows on the driver's side of the van. A sign out the front of the school boasts of having a pick-up and drop-off service, which centre owner Michelle O'Rourke revealed on Thursday would be permanently suspended in the wake of this latest tragedy. Just steps away from where the van was parked there are more signs warning of the dangers of leaving children in hot cars. 'Never leave children alone in a car,' one sign reads. 'Four-and-a-half minutes inside of a car could be as high as 70 degrees.' The warning also outlines health risks, including heat stress, dehydration, brain injury, serious kidney damage, and death. 'Always check your back seat is free of passengers before leaving your car,' the sign reads.  Ms O'Rourke sent an email to families on Thursday morning to inform them that school would be closed until at least the end of the week.  Meanwhile inside the centre, three plain clothes detectives were sifting through administrative documents and photographing the area behind the reception desk. Police tape blocks both the entrance to and the exit from Le Smileys and investigations are expected to continue for at least the next few days.  Earlier on Thursday, the youngster's aunt, Christy Atta-Singh, opened up about her heartache. 'Thank you to everyone that has messaged, called or offered help at this horrendous time. It's a disheartening time for all involved,' she wrote on Facebook. 'Vaeh has Austin in her blood so is fighting her little heart out, and has been raised by a tough woman.' 'It's gut wrenching seeing and being bedside to such an innocent child.' Ms Atta-Singh said her niece is 'in the best hands' and has 'all the love and support in the world'. ",

Little Nevaeh Austin has made significant progress in the hours since she was rescued from her seat at the Le Smileys Early Learning Centre in Gracemere about 3pm on Wednesday. The three-year-old is breathing on her own and stable but faces an uphill battle as her distraught family demands answers.

Her family are now demanding answers as to how she was forgotten by staff and left alone for six hours without anyone noticing she was missing. Traumatised grandmother Pamela Parker arrived at the local police station on Thursday afternoon and told waiting media her family would not stop until they got answers. Fighting back tears, Ms Parker said she's feeling 'lost, hurt and angry' as she processes the very near miss. 'I'm worried for my daughter. I'm worried for her mental health and how this is going to affect Nevaeh, at the end of the day and what this is going to do to her mental health.'  Nevaeh is still in hospital and very tired, but she's back to her 'happy self', family say. 'I'm thankful my granddaughter has pulled through but what this must be doing to her, I can't even imagine,' she said. Earlier on Thursday Nevaeh's aunt Christy Atta-Singh assured friends and family she was receiving the best care and would 'pull through'. 'Vaeh has Austin in her blood so is fighting her little heart out, and has been raised by a tough woman.' 'It's gut wrenching seeing and being bedside to such an innocent child.'

    "ed838954dcb6a86c00cb120f1f2cadb4bf606215d72f35a1a41f2874": "The new White House press secretary has been in a long-term relationship and shares a daughter with a prominent CNN correspondent, raising questions on whether the already ethical-challenged and scandal-scarred network can offer impartial coverage.   Karine Jean-Pierre, 44, who takes over from Jen Psaki on May 13 after serving as her deputy, is a partner of CNN's national correspondent Suzanne Malveaux, 55, and the pair share a seven-year-old daughter, Soleil. And, while the trailblazing and historic nature of her appointment was being celebrated by many - Jean-Pierre is the first black woman and first openly gay person to do the job - others were alarmed by conflicts of interest. The network has had to weather the firing of Chris Cuomo in December over his involvement in brother Andrew Cuomo's sex harassment scandal and then two months later dumped network president Jeff Zucker over his secret romance with CNN co-worker Allison Gollust. Juwan Holmes, associate editor of the online magazine LGBTQ Nation, spent the last two years writing about Jean-Pierre's work, and said he anticipated the concern. 'I'm sure there won't be Cuomo-level conflict of interest violations but expect it to have it bought up in the future...' he said. Others quickly slammed the network.  'This is one of many examples of the corporate media LITERALLY in bed with the government it covers,' tweeted Alex Marlow, editor-in-chief of Breitbart.  Another asked: 'What is the name of the Universe where this is not a Conflict of Interest?' Malveaux, who joined CNN in 2002, and Jean-Pierre are familiar faces on the DC scene - most recently attending the White House Correspondents' Dinner together on Saturday night. The pair met in 2012 at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.   Psaki admitted she was struggling to fight back tears as she introduced Jean-Pierre as her successor, calling her her 'partner in truth'. 'I'm going to cry', an emotional Psaki said at the start of her briefing on Thursday as she brought her successor up to the podium and hugged her.  'I just want to take the opportunity to celebrate and congratulate my friend, my colleague, my partner in truth Karine Jean-Pierre, the next White House Press Secretary,' Psaki said. Fox News' Peter Doocy then said he will miss his favorite sparring partner Psaki in the briefing room. She dryly responded by saying: 'Will you?' Psaki refused to comment on her future amid speculation she will likely head to MSNBC, and said she is only looking forward to 'sleeping' and 'reading books'.  She then asked reporters for Netflix suggestions.  'Karine not only brings the experience, talent and integrity needed for this difficult job, but she will continue to lead the way in communicating about the work of the Biden-Harris Administration on behalf of the American people,' Biden said in a statement. Biden said he and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden 'have known and respected Karine a long time and she will be a strong voice speaking for me and this Administration.' He went on to praise Psaki' for 'returning decency' to the White House briefing room in what appears to be a veiled jab at the Trump administration's more combative relationship with the press.  'Jen Psaki has set the standard for returning decency, respect and decorum to the White House Briefing Room,' Biden said. 'I want to say thank you to Jen for raising the bar, communicating directly and truthfully to the American people, and keeping her sense of humor while doing so.' 'I thank Jen her service to the country, and wish her the very best as she moves forward.' The Columbia University grad was born in Martinique, and served as chief of staff to now-Vice President Kamala Harris on the Biden campaign.  Jean-Pierre also worked in the Obama administration as Regional Political Director for the White House Office of Political Affairs, and on both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns.  Before joining Biden's presidential bid she was an MSNBC and NBC political analyst and held roles at MoveON.org and the American Civil Liberties Union.  Psaki lauded Jean-Pierre's historic appointment in a statement on Twitter.  'She will be the first black woman and the first openly LGBTQ+ person to serve as the White House Press Secretary. Representation matters and she will give a voice to many, but also make many dream big about what is truly possible,' the outgoing press secretary said.  Psaki said Jean-Pierre has 'decades of experience from her early years working in government and politics in NYC, to her years as an outspoken advocate, to serving as a long-time advisor to [Biden] back when he was the VP.' 'She is passionate. She is smart and she has a moral core that makes her not just a great colleague, but an amazing Mom and human. Plus, she has a great sense of humor,' Psaki praised.  Jean-Pierre has stepped in for Psaki at the podium multiple times in the first part of Biden's administration - perhaps most notably when the press secretary was out after testing positive for COVID-19.  Along with her new promotion, the White House also announced Thursday that former senior Biden adviser Anita Dunn would be returning to the administration in the same role.  Dunn left the White House in August 2021. She is also an Obama veteran, having served in the role of acting communications director in the former president's administration in 2009. Psaki, for her own part, has kept mum over her future job prospects - presumably for ethical reasons.  When asked about potential ethical concerns about her reportedly joining MSNBC while still at the podium, Psaki said during an April 1 briefing that she has 'abided' by any and all ethics guidelines without confirming the report.   'Well, there are a range of stringent ethical and legal requirements that are imposed on everybody in this administration and many administrations past about any conversations you're having with future employers,' she deflected at the time. 'That is true of any industry you're working in. And I have abided by those, and tried to take steps to go beyond that as well.'  She added, fresh off a stint of isolation due to COVID: 'I have nothing to confirm about my length of public service or planned service, or anything about consideration about next plans. I'm very happy to be standing with all of you here today after it felt like a never ending endless time in my basement quarantining away from my family.'  Other names that were potentially floated to replace Psaki are Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby, State Department spokesman Ned Price and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield. Jean-Pierre takes on the role as the White House faces an uphill battle to help Democrats hold onto the House and Senate in this fall's midterm elections, and as the administration struggles to address Americans' concerns about soaring inflation and the state of the economy.  She also comes into the job as Biden faces a daunting array of foreign policy challenges, including the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and North Korea's escalating nuclear testing program.  Biden is set to visit South Korea and Japan later this month and Europe in June. Taking the lectern briefly while Psaki briefed the press on Thursday, Jean-Pierre said she was 'still processing' the significance of her hire. She called it 'an honor and privilege to be behind this podium.' 'This is a historic moment, and it's not lost on me,' she said. 'It's a very emotional day.' Joe Biden's new press secretary attempted suicide after, wracked with anxiety about her sexuality, and with her mother reacting with disgust to her coming out, she failed to pass the exams to become a doctor. Her sister Edwine found her unconscious and saved her, she said.  Karine Jean-Pierre, 44, is the first black woman to become the White House press secretary, and the first openly gay person. She lives in Washington DC with her partner Suzanne Malveaux, a CNN national correspondent. They met in 2012 at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, and now have a seven-year-old daughter, Soleil, born in 2014.  Jean-Pierre last year told her own story of coming out to her family, to mark Pride Month. 'I came out to my Mom when I was 16 years old,' she tweeted in June 2021.  'The revolted look on her face sent me running back into the proverbial closet and slamming the door shut.  'After that, my sexuality became a family secret and it would stay that way for years.  'I dated, but I hid those relationships from my family.  'Just as American society has evolved over the course of the past couple of decades to embrace the LGBTQ community (never forgetting we still have work to do), my family has evolved to embrace my membership in it.  'I'm proud to be an out Black Queer woman and I have been for quite some time.  'I'm happy to say, my Mother is now proud of ALL of who I am; she loves my partner and she loves being a doting grandmother to the daughter we are raising.  'My journey towards feeling accepted by myself and loved ones wasn't an easy one, but it was worthwhile.  'No matter where you are in your journey, I see you, we see you and we celebrate you - Happy Pride!'  Jean-Pierre grew up in the New York borough of Queens, where the family moved when she was five. Both her parents were Haitian: her father was a cab driver and her mother was a health care worker.  She studied pre-med at New York Institute of Technology on Long Island, but failed to pass her exams. In her 2019 book, she writes that that, coupled with struggling with her sexuality, led her to spiral into depression and attempt suicide - saved by her sister, Edwine, who found her following an attempted carbon monoxide poisoning. 'I felt like an idiot,' she writes. 'Thanks in large part to my inability to confront my sexuality, I was so afraid of who I really was that I invested absolutely everything into who my parents and siblings thought I was and wanted me to be. 'Becoming a doctor was to be my saving grace. 'I had always clung to it as if it were a life raft. 'So when I failed at this one thing, my entire world crumbled. I wanted to die.' She said she now knows she 'wasn't thinking straight', but spent weeks planning how to do it. Jean-Pierre said she decided to kill herself to the sounds of Mary J. Blige's song Everlasting Love, and was woken from her unconscious state by Edwine. 'To this day, no one in my family has ever talked to me about my suicide attempt,' she writes. 'The fact that I actually tried to take my own life is so shameful and agonizing to me that I have never had the nerve to broach the subject with Edwine.' She said she still feels 'terrible about what I put Edwine through'. But the sisters remain close, with Instagram photos showing them all together, with their brother Christopher, a personal trainer. Both Edwine and Christopher still live in New York.  Jean-Pierre then became a volunteer firefighter, and eventually landed a place at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. Jean-Pierre has said she was never initially interested in politics - associating it, in her parents' homeland, with corruption - but was mentored by David Dinkins, mayor of New York City from 1990 to 1993: the first black person to be mayor of the city. She worked in New York City council before becoming involved in national politics - working on the John Edwards campaign during his 2004 presidential run, and then in 2008 as the political director for the White House Office of Political Affairs during the Obama administration.  Before joining the Biden presidential campaign, Jean-Pierre was the chief public affairs officer of the progressive group MoveOn.org and a former political analyst for NBC and MSNBC.   Biden offered the job to Jean-Pierre on Thursday in the Oval Office.  White House staffers were gathered after the offer and greeted Jean-Pierre with applause, an official said.  Two 'warm bottles' of champagne were procured for a toast in White House paper cups, the official added. Jean-Pierre had occasionally taken the lectern in the press briefing room instead of Psaki, and more frequently held off-camera 'gaggles' with reporters when Biden was traveling on Air Force One.  She traveled with Biden to Europe last fall and in March instead of Psaki, who had tested positive for COVID-19 before both trips.   Jean-Pierre takes on the role as the White House faces an uphill battle to help Democrats hold onto the House and Senate in this fall's midterm elections, and as the administration struggles to address Americans' concerns about soaring inflation and the state of the economy.  She also comes into the job as Biden faces a daunting array of foreign policy challenges, including the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and North Korea's escalating nuclear testing program.  Biden is set to visit South Korea and Japan later this month and Europe in June. 'Karine not only brings the experience, talent and integrity needed for this difficult job, but she will continue to lead the way in communicating about the work of the Biden-Harris administration on behalf of the American people,' Biden said in a statement. He praised Jean-Pierre, who has served as his principal deputy press secretary since Inauguration Day. Psaki, who leaves the White House on May 13, described her successor as a 'partner in truth,' noting the significance of the history-making appointment. 'Representation matters and she is going to give a voice to so many and show so many what is truly possible when you work hard and dream big,' Psaki said. Taking the lectern briefly while Psaki briefed the press on Thursday, Jean-Pierre said she was 'still processing' the significance of her hire. She called it 'an honor and privilege to be behind this podium.' 'This is a historic moment, and it's not lost on me,' she said. 'It's a very emotional day.'",
    "7d94cf0f277e4624ee28a6e24abcfd75c9ead2152f76d2ddb8b4c04c": "A $500,000 reward has been offered for information on the four-decade-old murder of a young woman who was viciously strangled in her kitchen with a dog leash.  Queensland Police and the family of the victim, Deborah Smykalla, have launched a fresh public appeal to help crack the cold case from Father's Day, 1981.  Then, the 22-year-old was found strangled to death, with a dog lead left around her neck in the kitchen of her home in Capalaba, south east of Brisbane.  When police arrived at the home at 9:45pm they found Ms Smykalla dead, a smouldering fire in the kitchen, the oven dial turned to 'on', and an overturned heater on the carpet. The scene lead detectives to suspect an unknown person had attempted to set the house on fire. Despite what Queensland police have called a 'significant investigation' over the last 40 years, police have not been able to figure out who was responsible for Ms Smykalla's death.  On the day of her death Ms Smykalla was seen in her yard with a man in his early 20s of slim build and short brown hair at around 4pm. Later, at around 7:30pm, two people were then seen sitting on the front porch.  Detectives would like to speak with those people or anyone with information about them.  Queensland Police's Homicide department are hopeful a reward will sweeten the deal for anyone sitting on information about the case as detectives make a renewed push to solve the mystery. Detective Senior Sergeant Tara Kentwell of the Cold Case Investigation Team said police have reviewed the case and know there are people out there who can provide crucial information and urged them to contact the police. 'The smallest piece of information could lead to a breakthrough in the investigation and I encourage anyone who has information about who was responsible for Ms Smykalla's murder to come forward,' she said. The reopening of the case will see cops using the latest forensic technology, including enhanced forensic DNA testing on the dog lead currently underway. Police are hoping the $500,000 reward will bring the person who left an anonymous online Crime Stoppers tip-off about the person behind the killing out of the shadows for further - potentially case-cracking - talks with detectives. Detectives would also like to speak with anyone that anyone has information in relation to a motorbike, possibly a 250cc or 500cc road trial bike that was witnessed at the address. The operation also includes billboard displays at Capalaba and Carina and targeted Facebook posts in the entire Bayside area to cast a wide net, hoping it will jog witnesses memories and encourage them to approach the police with information.  The $500,000 Queensland Government Reward is for information which leads to the apprehension and conviction of the person who killed Ms Smykalla, only for the first such informant. ",
    "ae7424e4bd532b11855e4f780b974ec09fb3be1e2315ed07673af096": "Amber Heard broke down on the stand as she detailed how Johnny Depp sexually assaulted her with a liquor bottle during emotional testimony that the actor's defense team labeled the 'performance of her life.'  The alleged assault took place in March 2015 in Australia at their rented home he was living in while filming Pirates of the Caribbean 5. This is the same incident that saw Johnny Depp's finger severed. He claimed Heard threw a liquor bottle which severed it. Heard testified that she did not witness Depp's fingertip being cut off.  'At some point he's on top of me, screaming I f**king hate you, you ruined my f**king life,' Heard testified as she sobbed uncontrollably. 'I'm on the countertop, he had me by the neck and was on top of me. 'I'm looking in his eyes and I don't see him any more. It wasn't him, it was black. I haven't been so scared in my life. He was looking at me. I was trying to get through to him, to say in some way it was me. Trying to get through to Johnny. 'My head was bashing against the back of the bar and I couldn't breathe. I remember trying to get up to tell him he was really hurting me. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't get through to him. I couldn't get up.' At this point, Heard became overwhelmed with emotion on the stand.  'Next thing I remember I was bent over backwards on the bar, I was staring at the blue light. My back was on the countertop. I thought he was punching me. I felt this pressure on my pubic bone and I could feel his arm moving. It looked like he was punching me. I could just feel this pressure. 'I don't remember what I said, I just remember being really still, not wanting to move. I remember looking around the room, looking at all the broken bottles, broken glass and I remember not wanting to move because I didn't know if it was broken, I didn't know if the bottle that he had inside me was broken. 'I couldn't feel it, I didn't feel pain, I didn't feel anything. 'I saw so much broken glass I didn't know if he would know if it was broken or not and I remember thinking please go I hope it's not broken. I don't know how that ended. I don't know how I got off the countertop. 'I just remember being in the bathroom. I remember retching, the sound my voice was making. I lost control of my bladder. I remember just retching, there was blood on the floor.' Depp's team claimed the actress' tales of abuse have evolved with 'new and convenient details' and plan on exposing her lies on cross-examination.  Heard said that leading up to the fight Depp confirmed he had not slept not had he eaten. 'We get into an argument. He was accusing me of (sleeping with) Eddie Redmayne (her co-star in The Danish Girl). He thought I was working with Billy Bob Thornton but I'd already worked with him a year earlier. He was very upset about him.' Heard said that Depp had taken 8-10 MDMA pills. She said, 'He confirmed he took that amount and he could take that amount. 8 or 10.' She said Depp continued accusing her of cheating on him. She said, 'He calls his agent, he calls a few people and he's screaming at them. I got a sense it was money, he got a sense people had been stealing from him. 'He was calling himself a wh**e, he'd been wh**ed out.' 'Next thing I remember is coming downstairs and looking for him. We had an interaction that I can't really describe, it didn't make a lot of sense to me. Just belligerent, throwing things, screaming at me. I realized I was back on the chopping block,' Heard said.  'He has me up against the wall, he slams me hard, I hit my head hard. This is the wall next to the kitchenette. There were these fridges and I remember being slammed up against those. I remember pushing him off of me. The name calling, the wh**e, the slut the fat a**. 'He was squeezing my neck. It got really nasty. It went from no one likes you, everyone warned me about you. He said everyone had warned him about me and he wished he'd never married me. That no one liked me. 'At some point I shoved him and he shoved me back. He said: 'Do you want to go little girl?'  Heard said she was struggling with him and he threw her across the room.  'I land on a games table. He gets on top of me on the games table and is just whacking me in the face, repetitive. We struggled. 'He's taunting me to take the bottle from him. He's holding out the bottle, the third time I get a hold of it, I slam it down on the ground between us. That really set him off. 'It was like a lightbulb switch went off. He starts screaming. I don't know if he backhanded me or hit me. It sent me down to the ground. By the time I picked myself off the floor he's got a bottle in his hand, he threw it at me, it missed. 'He had a broken bottle up against my face, neck area and he told me I'll carve up your face. It was terrifying. 'I remember him having me by the nightgown. I remember him throwing me around, I'm flailing. 'He's throwing these bottles at me. There's soda cans and they're coming at me one after another. I keep pulling myself into the bar area. He's standing in the only area you can exit. 'I can feel glass breaking behind me. I can remember being terrified. I couldn't move, I couldn't go anywhere. He ran out of things to throw, I ran to the exit and we got into this struggle by the bar area 'I remember my feet slipping on the tile as he was slamming me from the wall to the countertop. He had my nightgown and ripped it off my chest. 'He's teasing me he has my breasts in his hand, my nightgown came completely off, it was ripped off of me, I was naked. 'He's flinging me around. He's screaming at me he f**king hates me, I ruined his life. Over and over. He starts punching the wall next to my head, holding me by the neck. 'His energy shifted to the phone on the wall. He went from punching the wall, he picked up the phone - rahhhh! - screaming at the top of his lungs, I f**king hate you. He starts bashing the phone against the wall. 'Every time he pulled his hand back it was breaking into pieces, he's smashing it to smithereens.' Heard said that when she woke up the next day she could hear Marilyn Manson music blaring out of the speakers of the house. It 'became clear' that Depp had not slept. Heard said she saw brown writing on the walls that was in dried blood - there was blood on the carpet and brown letters that were messages to her. There was a 'giant penis' written on a painting and a table overturned. In the bar area where they had their fight the previous night there was broken glass everywhere. Heard said: 'He had his hand wrapped in these rags and I think he took them down or showed me, look what you made me do. Something to that effect. It was covered in paint. I put together he was using his finger - that's what he was using as a paintbrush.' Depp's security turned up and Heard tried to get him coffee but he threw the cup at the TV, she claimed.  Heard said, 'Johnny took his penis out of his pants and started trying to pee outside of the house saying he had more messages for me. His security looked at me and not laughed, played it off. It was like corralling a wild animal back into the house with his penis out of his pants. 'He went to pee on the wall of the house, saying he had more messages for me.' Heard added that there were 'mashed potatoes smeared all over the bedroom window and the door.' Later that night she found the steak she had been preparing for dinner when they got into their argument - pieces were all over the house. She said: 'I found the raw meat I'd left out, the steak, it was cut up and he'd ripped my nightgown into pieces and wrapped the meat up, wrapped the steak pieces up with my nightgown.' Heard detailed the lead up to the blowout fight. She said she and Depp had got married in February 2013 and that right after she flew to London to film The Danish Girl. Then in March she flew to Australia to join Depp while he was filming Pirates of the Caribbean 5. She said: 'I flew in all I wanted to do was see my new husband. He'd lost a ton of weight. I knew something was up. 'At some point early in that evening he pulls out a bag of MDMA. I was surprised because at the time that was, there was no question mark as to how I would respond. Why would you even think that's OK? 'He'd already gotten clean and sober. He seemed to suggest we should do it together. I was absolutely not. I want to see you and spend time with you. 'It was the exact opposite of what I wanted. It seemed delusional to suggest this. If you had been through what I'd been through it was crazy.' Heard said that they got into an argument - the first of many. She said: 'I shove past him, just stomp off. He grabs me. In my head I wasn't thinking of leaving yet but that would later be going through my mind 'I don't remember the exact sequence of things. I have a lot of flashes. 'The first night I distinctly remember at one point maybe I came back into the room but he shoved me. I went flying across these parakeet floors, just skidding. It looked so easy for him to throw me around like that. I just slid. 'We had another argument that was a spin off from that, it was this on-off sort of thing 'I remember he shoves me up against the fridge, he has me by the throat and was holding me there by my throat. He's bashing me against the wall next to the fridge. At some point I'm in his face, I remember slapping him across the face, screaming at him, screaming at me. 'I eventually barricaded the door. It wouldn't stop him from coming in, he could come in the other doors. At least I'd hear it. I just wanted to know if he came in.' Heard told the court that after they returned from Australia they reconciled but soon after she discovered he had cheated on her right after their wedding. She said that Depp passed out one day and she saw he had been texting another woman he had been seeing at the start of their relationship. Heard said that the date of their messages was 'right after the wedding', which took place in February 2015. Heard told the court that 'after touching down in Los Angeles' from the wedding in the Bahamas, 'the next day he went to this woman with whom he had a sexual relationship with.' She said: 'I freaked out. I immediately confronted him about it. I didn't care in that moment if he did kill me, which was likely in confronting him. I didn't care any more. He'd already ripped my heart out. 'From having been through it  in Australia weeks prior, I see this it was like....unbelievably painful, 'I'm yelling at him, calling him these ugly names, told him to get the f**k out the house. We were screaming at each other. I remember being so mad at him for cheating on me and doing so in this way, right after my wedding. 'It felt like everything came crashing down. I was so hurt,' During the row Heard called Depp a 'f**king pu**y' and he 'bolted' towards her. She said: 'He had his hand on the back of my hair and was yanking me down and hit me in the face with this cast. 'I remember this brief struggle we had before breakaway. Whitney, my sister, put herself between Johnny and I in the line of fire. 'Johnny swings at her, seeing my little sister and Johnny swings at her. I don't even wait for any other, in my head think of Kate Moss and stairs and I swung at him'. Heard was referring to her previous claims that Depp once pushed the supermodel, who he once dated, down the stairs. Depp shook his head as Heard made the claim. Heard said, 'All of my relationship to date to Johnny I hadn't landed a blow and for the first time I hit him square in the face. 'Johnny kind of looked stunned and laughed at me and lunged at me again and security stepped in between us and pulled Johnny away.' Heard said that after that Depp threw her clothing racks down the stairs, telling the court that 'everything he could touch he tried to destroy.' Heard claimed that during one fight in December 2015 Depp headbutted her and beat her so badly she thought she would die. She said that he told her: 'You really want to go now, tough guy' before punching her. She said: 'I look him right in the eyes. It was a really still moment.' '(He said) you want to go again, tough guy. I looked right up at his face, he balled up his face, leaned back and headbutted me square in the nose. 'Instantly (I felt) searing pain, It's one of the few memories I have of physical pain, searing pain'. Depp dragged Heard by the hair into a neighboring apartment, leaving chunks lying all over the floor. He got on top of her with her face in a pill and was repeatedly beating her. Heard said: 'He's trying to hold me with his knee on my back and he's punching me with a closed fist repeatedly. 'I remember the sound of Johnny's voice he got next to my ear and he was screaming over and over again I f**king hate you, I f**king hate you over and over. F**king hate you. Pounding the back of my head with his fist. 'I could hear myself scream until I couldn't hear myself any more I could just hear him say he was going to kill me and he sounded like an animal in pain when he was saying he f**king hated me. He sounded different like he was in agony. He just hit me over and over and over again. I got really still and it felt in my body quiet. 'I thought this is how I die, he's going to kill me now. He's going to kill me and he won't even have realized it. 'I couldn't breathe. I remember trying to scream and I couldn't scream suffocating in this pillow top with him holding me down punching me. I don't have any memory after that until I woke up.' February 3, 2015 Johnny Depp and Amber Heard marry in a private civil ceremony at their LA home, four years after they met as co-stars on the set of The Rum Diary. The couple celebrate with a lavish reception on an idyllic private island in the Bahamas that Depp bought in 2004 for $3.6 million. April 21, 2015 Heard breaches Australia's biosecurity laws when she and Depp fail to declare their two Yorkshire terriers when they arrive Down Under on a private jet for the filming of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Heard admits falsifying quarantine documents and is placed on a $1,000 one-month good behavior bond. May 23, 2016 Heard files for divorce after 15 months of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. Four days later a judge issues a temporary restraining order against Depp over domestic violence allegations. Pictures of Heard's alleged injuries hit the tabloids but the LAPD finds no evidence of a crime. August 16, 2016 Depp and Heard reach a $7 million divorce settlement which the actress promises to give to charity. Their marriage was 'intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,' the former lovers say in a statement. 'There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm'. December 18, 2018 The Washington Post publishes an op-ed by Heard, an ambassador for women's rights at for the American Civil Liberties Union, urging support for women who suffer domestic violence. 'Two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out,' reads the headline. March 1, 2019 Despite not being named in the article, Depp files a $50 million defamation suit in Fairfax Circuit Court, Virginia saying it implied he was an abuser and got him fired from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Depp dismisses Heard's abuse allegations as a 'hoax' and claims he was actually the victim of her violence. August 10, 2020 Heard countersues for $100 million, claiming vengeful Depp and his lawyer Adam Waldman targeted her with a vicious smear campaign, using media allies and internet trolls to amplify false stories about her and derail her acting career. November 1, 2020 Depp faces an uphill battle to save his reputation after he loses a libel battle with a British tabloid that labeled him a 'wife beater'. A judge in London's rules that The Sun's 2018 article was 'substantially true' and that the father-of-two had attacked Heard a dozen times, causing her to fear for her life on three occasions. April 11, 2022 After lengthy delays due to the Covid pandemic, the former flames finally lock horns in Fairfax County, Virginia where the Washington Post servers that published the disputed op-ed are based. The trial is expected to last six to seven weeks and celebrities tipped to give evidence include James Franco, Paul Bettany and Ellen Barkin.  ",

It led to long queues breaking out inside the airport, one of Australia's busiest, on Friday afternoon. One passenger who arrived shortly after 2pm at the airport said he and other travellers were unable to disembark their aircraft. 'Landed in Melbourne, been told to stay seated as there's a security issue inside. Unusual, very unusual,' he tweeted. Another shared a photo of a long line of travellers waiting to get through security.  'Monumental fail at Melbourne airport security. Queue is back into the international terminal. What a nightmare,' they said. One traveller labelled the line to get through security as 'ridiculous'.  Daily Mail Australia contacted Qantas for comment. ",
    "1776bdc2e5e42a6e09a32db914d9714f3cd424410d73ee5c5fc048b7": "The attack by three men could not have been more brazen: a mid- afternoon strike on the headquarters of the state security bureau. One after another, they fired rocket-propelled grenades before jumping in their car and speeding off. Smoke billowed from the building on the corner of Karl Marx Street and several windows were shattered but no one was hurt - it was a bank holiday so no staff were inside. This mysterious attack on Easter Monday was merely the first in a series of incidents that have sparked fears Russia's struggling invasion of Ukraine may soon explode wider. For they are happening in Transnistria, a sliver of land on Ukraine's western flank which broke away from Moldova during the collapse of the Soviet Union and remains firmly under Moscow's thumb. The incidents are accompanied by increasingly bellicose threats from the Kremlin - and fit Vladimir Putin's cruel playbook by stirring tensions that he then uses as a flimsy excuse to send in his troops as self-proclaimed saviour of Russian speakers. Bizarrely, one of the Easter Monday attackers dropped his grenade launcher and it was revealed to be a Russian-made type used only by the armed forces of Moscow, Transnistria and the African nation of Gabon. 'I don't think these were the Gabonese,' commented a Moldovan minister drily. Little wonder there is growing alarm in this small European nation of 3.5million people that they will be dragged into the Ukrainian war, a move that could add to pressure for Western intervention given the country's close relationship with neighbouring Romania, a member of both Nato and the EU. 'Our assessment indicates the hardline pro-Russian camp is behind all this to get Russia to intervene,' said Mihai Popsoi, head of the ruling party's parliamentary group. 'These people don't breathe without approval from the Kremlin.' Popsoi admits to profound worries as Moldova relies on its neutrality for security more than on its small conscript army - especially with 1,500 Russian 'peacekeepers' based just one hour's drive from Tiraspol, Transnistria's capital, an isolated place of 400,000 people trapped in time from its Soviet past. 'Hope and optimism is not a good strategy - but it is all we have,' he said. Yet this Russian-born York University graduate, whose father returned to Moldova to fight against the separatists in the early 1990s, adds they have endured '30 years of anxiety over the frozen conflict' in Transnistria. Transnistria, an impoverished area not even formally recognised by Russia, feels like a hangover from yesteryear with statues of Lenin, hammer and sickle insignia and black-and-white portraits of Soviet heroes hanging by the main street. But when I sneaked in this week, I also saw Russian 'peacekeeping' soldiers, military barracks and new armed checkpoints. Sources told me there has been significant recent work to upgrade the airport for handling military planes. Tensions started rising after a senior Russian general said last month the Kremlin intended to take control of southern Ukraine to create a direct land link to Transnistria where he claimed there was 'oppression of the Russian-speaking population'. This was followed by calls from politicians in Transnistria for recognition as an independent state in the face of 'attacks' and Nato meddling - a disturbing echo of the fake claims made by Putin's stooges in the Donbas region of Ukraine before the war. It is believed that there are 7,000 troops under Kremlin control, including Transnistria's own forces, along with an old Soviet arms dump containing 20,000 tonnes of munitions. Ukrainian intelligence is warning Putin may use Victory Day next Monday - marking Russia's 1945 defeat of Nazi Germany - to create a pretext for invasion. While in Transnistria, I watched TV crews film officials handing out the Ribbon of St George (Russia's version of the Remembrance Poppy, which is banned in Moldova) and interview recipients. Oleksandr V Danylyuk, a Ukrainian government defence and security adviser, said Putin might seize Moldova to claim to Russia that his 'troops can achieve miracles'. The Royal United Services Institute also warns that Russia might destabilise Moldova to tie down Ukrainian forces, assist its own military logistics, counter the growing pro-European sensibilities and show that support for Kyiv has wider consequences. Moscow's concern over Moldova has been bubbling since November 2020 when voters threw out a pro-Kremlin president and turned to Western-educated leaders who promised to tackle corruption. Vladimir Voronin, a veteran Communist Party chief who was Moldova's president for eight years, recently claimed that people driven to despair have the right to revolt in the face of 'the current dictatorial regime'. Meanwhile, Russian intelligence, having warned Putin about Russia's declining influence in Moldova, hopes to exploit the economic fallout of the war which has seen spiralling energy prices, loss of exports and a huge influx of refugees over Ukraine's border. 'We struggle with everything in terms of prices, money, opportunities - and now with various forms of Russian aggression,' said Silvia Ursul, 32, an environmentalist in Chisinau. 'It is taking a toll on my mental health.' Like many others, Ursul compares the situation with Europe's build-up to World War Two. 'The Kremlin will do whatever it takes to destabilise us and take us back to the Dark Ages. 'It's so tragic - I don't see any hope for the best.' Valeriu Gushan, 36, a welder and military reservist, said he is worried that Putin will oust the Moldovan government with the help of collaborators - and that his country's leaders are not preparing their people to fight back in the face of an existential threat. He said: 'I fear the government won't give us the weapons to protect ourselves from the Russians.' Meanwhile, the Bulgarian government has urged its citizens to leave Moldova amid widespread claims that families are starting to flee potential conflict, with Ukraine having blocked roads by the border and some military-age men in Transnistria already leaving to avoid conscription. 'People are under constant stress and don't know what to do next,' said Ekaterina, a hotel manager in Transnistria's capital. 'There are so many negative scenarios. I hope we won't have to hide in the bomb shelters that city services are preparing for us. We try to continue with our normal lives - although we are sitting on a powder keg.' Despite the power of Russian propaganda in oligarch-dominated Transnistria, analysts hope its leaders and citizens will seek to avoid conflict after seeing the destruction inflicted on Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv and Mariupol. Alexei Tulbure, Moldova's former ambassador to the United Nations, believes that a Kremlin attack from Transnistria on Odesa, just 25 miles along the coast, could backfire since its inferior troops from the enclave would be crushed by battle-hardened Ukrainian defence forces.  'Ukraine would be happy since it would eliminate this Russian threat quickly,' he said. However, Tulbure added that there is a risk that any attack on Moldova could drag in Romania, which has deep historic and cultural ties to his nation. Many people in both Moldova and Transnistria have Romanian passports. 'They would be under huge pressure to intervene - and this might give the green light for Nato,' he said. This week, the EU pledged to 'significantly increase' military support. During a visit to Chisinau, Charles Michel, president of the European Council, tweeted: 'Transnistria should not be used as a Trojan horse to further exacerbate tensions in the region.' Tulbure, who is collecting oral histories from elderly Moldovans with memories from the 1940s of Stalin's deportations to Siberia and the genocidal slaughter of Jews, sees hideous parallels between Putin's actions and these past horrors. 'We are witnessing the same sort of propaganda techniques to dehumanise people, the same sort of rape and murder being carried out by soldiers - and it is astounding that it's coming from one of the victor countries in the Second World War. 'I fear that Putin's war has killed the Russia that existed in the Moldovan soul,' he added, shaking his head sadly. Additional reporting by Kate Baklitskaya",
    "6418cf70aaa704af594197db83f9a5c70b70ad532ead3e56a6a63f20": "House hunters have been warned about a cruel online scam which has ripped off thousands from would-be tenants. Authorities are investigating alleged Facebook Marketplace fraudsters who took advantage of the tight rental market on the Gold Coast to fleece $30,000 from at least 10 victims, including single mums. The scam resulted in three families and removal trucks turning up to their 'new home' at Pimpama last weekend, only find to discover they'd been duped. It has prompted the horrified real estate agent leasing the $550 a week home to issue an urgent warning to prospective tenants to be cautious about online platforms they're viewing properties on. Single mum Marie-Claire Lord is planning to make the 700km move from Newcastle NSW to the Sunshine State. She came across the three bedroom duplex online advertised for $500 a week and handed over a $2,000 bond to the 'landlord'. Her worst fears were realised after she found the same property advertised on realestate.com.au for a different price and got in contact with the listed agent. Ms Lord reported the alleged scam to Queensland Police and is now spreading the word to warn other prospective renters. 'The worst part is I'm not the only person. We are upwards of 10 different victims and upwards of $30,000,' she wrote online. 'Anyone in the rental market needs to be made aware of these predators.' She told the Gold Coast Bulletin: 'It might not be a lot of money to lose for some but it felt to me like my dreams were crushed.' Mother-of-four and shift worker Patricia Pomare is on the brink of homelessness having spent her entire savings in trying to find a new home. She expressed interest in the same Pimpama duplex on Facebook Marketplace, and was told by the 'landlord' who went by the name of Regina Bray that she was the 'ideal tenant'. She paid $3,000 for the bond and another four weeks of rent before realising she too had been scammed after speaking to the real estate. 'I found it on (Facebook) Marketplace, I just couldn't find anything on real estate,' Ms Pomare told Nine News.  'I went through all the procedures, she sent the application forms to me, I filled them out and sent it back. They did look legitimate.' She's now sleeping in her car. 'I have nowhere to go,' she added. The saga has also cost Ms Pomare her relationship with her adult daughter as the pair had been planning to go halves in renting the property. She wants the alleged scammer tracked down and jailed. It's understood at least two other prospective tenants were also allegedly scammed over the same property. Wings Real Estate Helensvale senior property manager Emma Snowdon hasn't seen a such a brazen act in her eight years in the real estate industry. She urged prospective tenants to be vigilant about what they're doing and the online platforms they're viewing properties. 'The lengths this scammer went to brazenly prey on vulnerable renters is unbelievable. It's no different to targeting the elderly,' she said. 'People are desperate to rent at the moment and will often try to do whatever they can to secure a property.' Daily Mail Australia contacted several victims and Wings Real Estate Helensvale for further comment. Cybercrime watchdog Australian Cyber Security Centre has referred reports of the alleged scam to Queensland and NSW Police. The state's Residential Tenancy Authority urges tenants to treat landlords with suspicion if they refuse to meet in person and to get a bond receipt from the agency.",
    "8f00b68b509b58c645222ac23ea3170cba6c60048581005e91e6ba84": "Dylan Alcott has taken a swipe at Anthony Albanese after the Labor leader failed to outline his six-point plan for the NDIS in a train-wreck press conference. Mr Albanese was pressed by reporters on Thursday to outline the plan put forward by the Labor Party to improve the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The Opposition leader stumbled over his words, went off camera to accept a note from an advisor and then returned to recite the six-point plan. Alcott, who was announced the 2022 Australian of the Year in January, took to Twitter following the televised gaffe. 'Pretty pretty please - can all sides of parliament take the time to understand the NDIS and it's importance. People's lives depend on it,' he wrote.  Reporters bombarded Mr Albanese with questions about his NDIS plan with one of them shouting, 'You do not know your own policy, Mr Albanese'.  After a few more questions on different topics, Mr Albanese went off camera and journalists saw an advisor hand him a document.  Reporters immediately accused the Labor leader of being handed the NDIS policy document which detailed the plan. 'You've just been handed a policy document,' one journalist said.  'Is that the six-point plan there?' another asked. 'That's not right,' Mr Albanese said with a wry smile as he shuffled his papers. He then read out the six-point plan. Alcott was born with a tumour wrapped around his spinal cord and he was operated on by surgeons as a baby. The surgery was a success, but left Alcott a paraplegic requiring him to get around on a wheelchair. It marks the second time the tennis champion has been forced to weigh into politics during the federal election after prime minister Scott Morrison said he was 'blessed' to have two healthy children. The Prime Minister made the controversial comment at the first leaders' debate in Brisbane on April 20.  Mr Morrison had been asked about removing funding for the National Disability Insurance Scheme by Katherine, a mother of autistic four-year-old boy Ethan, who said she'd heard stories about families losing funding under the scheme. 'I've been told that to give my son the best future, I should vote Labor. Can you tell me what the future of the NDIS looks like under your government?'  Scott Morrison said: 'Jenny and I have been blessed, we have two children who haven't had to go through that.' 'And so for parents, with children who are disabled, I can only try and understand your aspirations for those children.' 'And then I think that is the beauty of the National Disability Insurance Scheme,' he added.  Alcott was quick to voice his opinion on the Prime Minister's comment at the leader's debate, where he counted his disability a 'blessing'. 'Woke up this morning feeling very blessed to be disabled - I reckon my parents are pretty happy about it too.' 'Feeling sorry for us and our families doesn't help. Treating us equally, and giving us the choice and control over our own lives does,' he said.",
    "44067f1fd874dff9a683103cdf16a0e0069ac114e74f0c086cb52303": "Desperate parents across the United States are struggling to get their hands on baby formula amid a nationwide shortage as major national retailers have enforced rationing and one website charged up to $800 for the precious tins following a recall on popular products after an infant died of an infection. In the week ending April 24, CBS News reports, 40 to 50 percent of the top-selling baby formula products were out of stock at stores across the country, according to an analysis from Datasembly, which tracked baby formula stock at more than 11,000 retailers. National out-of-stock levels jumped nine percentage points from 31 percent to 40 percent between April 3 and April 24, according to an analysis from Datasembly. 'An entire month [there] was nothing... nothing online, nothing in stores nearby,' Nicole Brown, the mother of a 5-month-old told News 4 Jacksonville in Florida.  'I can get Amazon delivered to my door, but I can't feed my son. It's absolutely heartbreaking.'    And in Virginia, Jill Bradford, a foster mom to a 5-month-old baby girl with medical needs, says she has less than two days of the special amino acid-based formula the baby needs. 'We've called the WIC office,' Bradford told WTVR. 'We've called Thrive, which is a supply company. We've called every hospital system in the state. I've contacted personally, every Kroger, Walgreens, Walmart and CVS within the tri-cities area.' She noted she found eight cans of the formula the child needs on eBay, but it's being sold for $800. The cans typically cost between $43 and $47.  The shortage began during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts say, when companies started to face supply-chain issues, including procuring the necessary ingredients, packaging hang-ups and labor shortages. It only got worse in February, when Abbott Labs first announced a recall of certain Alimentum, Similac and EleCare formulas after five infants who used the formula contracted a Cronobacter sakazakii infection, which can cause severe blood infections and meningitis. One of the infants died as a result. Among the hardest-hit areas, according to Datasembly, were Iowa, Missouri, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas - where the out-of-stock rate in the capitol of San Antonio was 56 percent. National retailers like Walgreens and CVS are now limiting customers to just three baby formula products per purchase, and at Target.com consumers can only buy up to four pieces of a given baby formula product at a time - leaving parents scrambling as nearly three-quarters of babies in the United States are on formula for their first six months. The situation is even worse for those whose children are put on a specific formula either because they have allergies or due to their nutritional needs.  Ashleigh Olsen, also of Jacksonville, Florida, said her 9-month-old is limited to a specific formula she orders straight from the manufacturer as her son could face an allergic reaction to others. But there is no word on when it will be available again.    'Luckily I stocked up last time. So today when I opened my last can, that kind of lit my fire a little bit,' Olsen  said.  And in the midwest, Kassidi Hillard, who has a 2-month-old who needs Similac Pro-Advance, told WDRB she has 'looked at every store in Indiana and here (in Kentucky) and haven't found her formula at not one store. 'It's kind of stressful, cause if you can't find formula, it's like they can't eat nothing else,' Hillard said. 'They can't have baby food, they can't have hard food, they can't have what we eat so it's really, it's not an easy thing to go through.' In Texas, Emily Pyeatt, 22, wrote on Facebook that she recently went to eight stores in search of formula for her 8-month-old. 'This is the scariest thing I've ever experienced,' she wrote on March 30. 'How are we supposed to feed our children when there's NO FORMULA ON THE SHELVES?' She later told the Washington Post that as she was down to her last three cans, she has been easing her son onto more solid foods, as she does not produce enough milk to breastfeed. 'It was a very heartbreaking decision to stop, and I think it's upsetting for someone to say that,' Pyeatt said, adding: 'I pray for the women who have babies who are not old enough for solid food.' Danielle Arzola, 27, also of Texas, told the Post that when she tried to switch formula brands, her 6-month-old got sick, and she now has to drive all over town to find the brand she needs. She has even resorted to buying formula from people in other states. But the situation is dire everywhere, with one Michigan mom, who was not identified, also told FOX Business that she has been having trouble finding formula for her daughter, who lost a lot of weight following her birth. 'When we ran to the local Target to one day get some just days after she was born, the shelves were completely empty.  'My heart literally sank,' she said, noting: 'Luckily, she doesn't need any special formula, and I was able to order online, but not everyone has been as lucky. 'Our neighbor said her family member can't find the sensitive type of formula for their newborn who has stomach issues anywhere. 'They're in a panic daily not knowing if they'll be able to feed their newborn tomorrow or the day after - my heart breaks for those parents.' The company announced in March it has not found any Cronobacter sakazakii in any samples of the formula it sends out, and conducts tests on a regular basis. But it did say it found evidence of the bacteria in a 'non-product contact area' at its Sturgis, Michigan plant.  Now, baby formula producers are working to once again ramp up production. 'W3e know that this recall has further exacerbated an industry-wide instant formula supply shortage,' Abbott Labs told the Washington Post in a statement. 'We are doing everything we can to address it,' the company said, including ramping up production of Similac, air-freighting in products from Europe and working with health care providers to identify alternative formulas. Enfamil, meanwhile, told News 4 Jacksonville: 'At Enfamil, we are dedicated to giving the millions of babies and toddlers that rely on our formulas the best start in life. 'We are aware that some parents are having trouble finding their favorite baby formula products in their preferred store,' the company said, noting: 'We have been optimizing our efforts to address any issues as fast as possible, and meet the needs of all babies who rely on our formula.' The Food and Drug Administration also told News 4 Jacksonville that it has met with several infant formula manufacturers on a weekly basis 'to try to increase capacity to produce specialty and metabolic products overall.' In the meantime, experts say, parents should not dilute their baby's formula, try to make their own formula at home or try to replace it with cow's milk.  Doing so is 'not nutritionally comparable with breast milk or infant formula,' according to Brian Dittmeier, senior director of public policy at the National WIC Association, and could cause nutrient deficiencies that can have a 'profound impact on an infant's growth and development.' He said any parents who are struggling to find formula can contact their local WIC agencies and food banks for help locating some in their communities.  The Infant Nutrition Council of America is also encouraging parents to keep a 10-day to two week supply of formula at home  - but is urging them not to stockpile products as the shortage continues - and experts say there is no end in sight.",
    "ac42d61e3fb3477d0a05df13059e76ce614e169e95e7d203508fc7f7": "Joe Biden's new press secretary attempted suicide after she failed the exams to become a doctor, which followed her mother reacting with disgust to her coming out as gay. Karine Jean-Pierre, 44, is the first black woman to become the White House press secretary, and the first openly gay person. She lives in Washington DC with her partner Suzanne Malveaux, a CNN national correspondent. They met in 2012 at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, and now have a seven-year-old daughter, Soleil.  Jean-Pierre last year told the difficult story of coming out to her conservative Haitian family, to mark Pride Month. She had previously recounted, in her 2019 book, her attempt to take her own life.  Her sister Edwine found her unconscious and saved her, she said.  Jean-Pierre said she decided to kill herself to the sounds of Mary J. Blige's song Everlasting Love, and was woken from her unconscious state by Edwine. 'To this day, no one in my family has ever talked to me about my suicide attempt,' she wrote. 'The fact that I actually tried to take my own life is so shameful and agonizing to me that I have never had the nerve to broach the subject with Edwine.' She said she still feels 'terrible about what I put Edwine through'. 'I came out to my Mom when I was 16 years old,' she tweeted in June 2021.  'The revolted look on her face sent me running back into the proverbial closet and slamming the door shut.  'After that, my sexuality became a family secret and it would stay that way for years.  'I dated, but I hid those relationships from my family.  'Just as American society has evolved over the course of the past couple of decades to embrace the LGBTQ community (never forgetting we still have work to do), my family has evolved to embrace my membership in it.  'I'm proud to be an out Black Queer woman and I have been for quite some time.  'I'm happy to say, my Mother is now proud of ALL of who I am; she loves my partner and she loves being a doting grandmother to the daughter we are raising.  'My journey towards feeling accepted by myself and loved ones wasn't an easy one, but it was worthwhile.  'No matter where you are in your journey, I see you, we see you and we celebrate you - Happy Pride!'  Jean-Pierre grew up in the New York borough of Queens, where the family moved when she was five. Both her parents were Haitian: her father was a cab driver and her mother was a health care worker.  She studied pre-med at New York Institute of Technology on Long Island, but failed to pass her exams. In her 2019 book, she writes that that, coupled with struggling with her sexuality, led her to spiral into depression and attempt suicide - saved by her sister, Edwine, who found her following an attempted carbon monoxide poisoning. 'I felt like an idiot,' she writes. 'Thanks in large part to my inability to confront my sexuality, I was so afraid of who I really was that I invested absolutely everything into who my parents and siblings thought I was and wanted me to be. 'Becoming a doctor was to be my saving grace. 'I had always clung to it as if it were a life raft. 'So when I failed at this one thing, my entire world crumbled. I wanted to die.' She said she now knows she 'wasn't thinking straight', but spent weeks planning how to do it. But the sisters remain close, with Instagram photos showing them all together, with their brother Christopher, a personal trainer. Both Edwine and Christopher still live in New York.  Jean-Pierre then became a volunteer firefighter, and eventually landed a place at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. Jean-Pierre has said she was never initially interested in politics - associating it, in her parents' homeland, with corruption - but was mentored by David Dinkins, mayor of New York City from 1990 to 1993: the first black person to be mayor of the city. She worked in New York City council before becoming involved in national politics - working on the John Edwards campaign during his 2004 presidential run, and then in 2008 as the political director for the White House Office of Political Affairs during the Obama administration.  Before joining the Biden presidential campaign, Jean-Pierre was the chief public affairs officer of the progressive group MoveOn.org and a former political analyst for NBC and MSNBC.   Biden offered the job to Jean-Pierre on Thursday in the Oval Office.  White House staffers were gathered after the offer and greeted Jean-Pierre with applause, an official said.  Two 'warm bottles' of champagne were procured for a toast in White House paper cups, the official added. Jean-Pierre had occasionally taken the lectern in the press briefing room instead of Psaki, and more frequently held off-camera 'gaggles' with reporters when Biden was traveling on Air Force One.  She traveled with Biden to Europe last fall and in March instead of Psaki, who had tested positive for COVID-19 before both trips.   Jean-Pierre takes on the role as the White House faces an uphill battle to help Democrats hold onto the House and Senate in this fall's midterm elections, and as the administration struggles to address Americans' concerns about soaring inflation and the state of the economy.  She also comes into the job as Biden faces a daunting array of foreign policy challenges, including the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and North Korea's escalating nuclear testing program.  Biden is set to visit South Korea and Japan later this month and Europe in June. 'Karine not only brings the experience, talent and integrity needed for this difficult job, but she will continue to lead the way in communicating about the work of the Biden-Harris administration on behalf of the American people,' Biden said in a statement. He praised Jean-Pierre, who has served as his principal deputy press secretary since Inauguration Day. Psaki, who leaves the White House on May 13, described her successor as a 'partner in truth,' noting the significance of the history-making appointment. 'Representation matters and she is going to give a voice to so many and show so many what is truly possible when you work hard and dream big,' Psaki said. Taking the lectern briefly while Psaki briefed the press on Thursday, Jean-Pierre said she was 'still processing' the significance of her hire. She called it 'an honor and privilege to be behind this podium.' 'This is a historic moment, and it's not lost on me,' she said. 'It's a very emotional day.' The new White House press secretary has been in a long-term relationship and shares a daughter with a prominent CNN correspondent, raising questions on whether the already ethical-challenged and scandal-scarred network can offer impartial coverage.   Karine Jean-Pierre, 44, who takes over from Jen Psaki on May 13 after serving as her deputy, is a partner of CNN's national correspondent Suzanne Malveaux, 55, and the pair share a seven-year-old daughter, Soleil. And, while the trailblazing and historic nature of her appointment was being celebrated by many - Jean-Pierre is the first black woman and first openly gay person to do the job - others were alarmed by conflicts of interest. The network has had to weather the firing of Chris Cuomo in December over his involvement in brother Andrew Cuomo's sex harassment scandal and then two months later dumped network president Jeff Zucker over his secret romance with CNN co-worker Allison Gollust. Juwan Holmes, associate editor of the online magazine LGBTQ Nation, spent the last two years writing about Jean-Pierre's work, and said he anticipated the concern. 'I'm sure there won't be Cuomo-level conflict of interest violations but expect it to have it bought up in the future...' he said. Others quickly slammed the network.  'This is one of many examples of the corporate media LITERALLY in bed with the government it covers,' tweeted Alex Marlow, editor-in-chief of Breitbart.  Another asked: 'What is the name of the Universe where this is not a Conflict of Interest?' Malveaux, who joined CNN in 2002, and Jean-Pierre are familiar faces on the DC scene - most recently attending the White House Correspondents' Dinner together on Saturday night. The pair met in 2012 at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.   Psaki admitted she was struggling to fight back tears as she introduced Jean-Pierre as her successor, calling her her 'partner in truth'. 'I'm going to cry', an emotional Psaki said at the start of her briefing on Thursday as she brought her successor up to the podium and hugged her.  'I just want to take the opportunity to celebrate and congratulate my friend, my colleague, my partner in truth Karine Jean-Pierre, the next White House Press Secretary,' Psaki said. Fox News' Peter Doocy then said he will miss his favorite sparring partner Psaki in the briefing room. She dryly responded by saying: 'Will you?' Psaki refused to comment on her future amid speculation she will likely head to MSNBC, and said she is only looking forward to 'sleeping' and 'reading books'.  She then asked reporters for Netflix suggestions.  'Karine not only brings the experience, talent and integrity needed for this difficult job, but she will continue to lead the way in communicating about the work of the Biden-Harris Administration on behalf of the American people,' Biden said in a statement. Biden said he and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden 'have known and respected Karine a long time and she will be a strong voice speaking for me and this Administration.' He went on to praise Psaki' for 'returning decency' to the White House briefing room in what appears to be a veiled jab at the Trump administration's more combative relationship with the press.  'Jen Psaki has set the standard for returning decency, respect and decorum to the White House Briefing Room,' Biden said. 'I want to say thank you to Jen for raising the bar, communicating directly and truthfully to the American people, and keeping her sense of humor while doing so.' 'I thank Jen her service to the country, and wish her the very best as she moves forward.' The Columbia University grad was born in Martinique, and served as chief of staff to now-Vice President Kamala Harris on the Biden campaign.  Jean-Pierre also worked in the Obama administration as Regional Political Director for the White House Office of Political Affairs, and on both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns.  Before joining Biden's presidential bid she was an MSNBC and NBC political analyst and held roles at MoveON.org and the American Civil Liberties Union.  Psaki lauded Jean-Pierre's historic appointment in a statement on Twitter.  'She will be the first black woman and the first openly LGBTQ+ person to serve as the White House Press Secretary. Representation matters and she will give a voice to many, but also make many dream big about what is truly possible,' the outgoing press secretary said.  Psaki said Jean-Pierre has 'decades of experience from her early years working in government and politics in NYC, to her years as an outspoken advocate, to serving as a long-time advisor to [Biden] back when he was the VP.' 'She is passionate. She is smart and she has a moral core that makes her not just a great colleague, but an amazing Mom and human. Plus, she has a great sense of humor,' Psaki praised.  Jean-Pierre has stepped in for Psaki at the podium multiple times in the first part of Biden's administration - perhaps most notably when the press secretary was out after testing positive for COVID-19.  Along with her new promotion, the White House also announced Thursday that former senior Biden adviser Anita Dunn would be returning to the administration in the same role.  Dunn left the White House in August 2021. She is also an Obama veteran, having served in the role of acting communications director in the former president's administration in 2009. Psaki, for her own part, has kept mum over her future job prospects - presumably for ethical reasons.  When asked about potential ethical concerns about her reportedly joining MSNBC while still at the podium, Psaki said during an April 1 briefing that she has 'abided' by any and all ethics guidelines without confirming the report.   'Well, there are a range of stringent ethical and legal requirements that are imposed on everybody in this administration and many administrations past about any conversations you're having with future employers,' she deflected at the time. 'That is true of any industry you're working in. And I have abided by those, and tried to take steps to go beyond that as well.'  She added, fresh off a stint of isolation due to COVID: 'I have nothing to confirm about my length of public service or planned service, or anything about consideration about next plans. I'm very happy to be standing with all of you here today after it felt like a never ending endless time in my basement quarantining away from my family.'  Other names that were potentially floated to replace Psaki are Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby, State Department spokesman Ned Price and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield. Jean-Pierre takes on the role as the White House faces an uphill battle to help Democrats hold onto the House and Senate in this fall's midterm elections, and as the administration struggles to address Americans' concerns about soaring inflation and the state of the economy.

    "bdbbf9e9641dedfb45f2c3348ee20526160813f2bd6e2902242aa6dc": "An Ohio State University student was pronounced dead Thursday after overdosing on a fake Adderall pill that was laced with fentanyl.   OSU President Kristina Johnson has confirmed the tragic passing of the unidentified student in a statement Thursday.  Johnson said in the same statement that two others students were hospitalized following the overdose.  One of those students remains in critical condition while another has been released from a local hospital. There names and genders were not released. All three of the students overdosed off campus. Columbus police were called to a home along East Lane Avenue late on May 4 after someone called 911 to say that their roommates had overdosed, reports WBNS.  In the statement, Johnson said that it is 'critical' for OSU students to be 'aware of the possibility of contaminated drugs in our community.' On the same day as the student's death, OSU students were sent an alert warning about the presence of fake Adderall that contains fentanyl in the community.  The warning read, 'While we strongly discourage any kind of drug misuse, if you, or someone you know, may choose to experiment with drugs.'  It goes on to advise students to pick up a Naloxone kit or fentanyl test strips at the Wilce Student Health Services on Millikin Road in Columbus.   According to Jeff Klingler, the president and CEO of the Central Hospital Ohio Council said that fake Adderall pills were being sold around the OSU campus. He added, 'Fentanyl causes 90% of overdose deaths in central Ohio.' Adderall is a prescription drug used to treat Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. However, the drug is commonly used by students as a 'study drug.' The news of the student's death came on the final day of OSU's spring exam schedule.  An OSU study in 2018 found that 28 percent of students said that it was very easy to obtain stimulants in order to study or improve grades.  The same study found that 21 percent of students who were prescribed a stimulant from doctor had shared the drug with another student.  The death of the student comes just days before Ohio State's spring commencement ceremony, which takes place at Ohio Stadium on May 8.   Between January and November 2021, there were  more than an estimated 106,854 drug overdose deaths in the year to November 2021, a 15.6% increase from the same period a year earlier, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. In April 2022, Ryan Michael Reavis, 39 was sentenced to 10 years in prison for selling counterfeit painkiller pills that were laced with fentanyl to rapper Mac Miller causing the his untimely death at 26 in 2018.  A month earlier, five West Point cadets on Spring Break in Florida overdosed on fentanyl laced cocaine. The United Nations International Narcotics Control Board said in a report that was published in March 2022 that websites run by Mexican and Colombian drug cartels often advertise fentanyl-laced pills as Xanax, Adderall or Oxycodone, and Raul Martin del Campo, a member of the Control Board, said 'the majority of people do not know they are using fentanyl.' In Florida, Walgreens reached a $683 million settlement with the state of Florida in a lawsuit accusing the company of improperly dispensing millions of painkillers that contributed to the opioid crisis, state officials said Thursday. In Washington State, three opioid distributors, McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corp., settled a lawsuit with the state for $518 million. ",
    "9807ef8ee0e7ca32f9e5233fa8cf2e5bdbb27d10deb20de635d0b468": "The Reserve Bank has confirmed Australian households will be hit with a 'further lift' in interest rates to rein inflation, which it expects to hit six per cent in a level not seen since the year 2000. In its quarterly statement on monetary policy, and just days after raising the cash rate for the first time in over a decade, the RBA also warned rising interest rates and consumer prices are expected to weigh on households' budgets.  'The Board is committed to doing what is necessary to ensure that inflation in Australia returns to target over time,' the statement released on Friday said.  'This will require a further lift in interest rates over the period ahead.'  The RBA raised the cash rate to 0.35 per cent at its board meeting this week from a record low 0.1 per cent, where it had stood since November 2020.  It expects the economy to grow by 4.25 per cent this year compared with 4.2 per cent in 2021.  'The domestic outlook is supported by the substantial boost to national income from high commodity prices and growth in private consumption and investment,' it said.  'Growth is then forecast to moderate in 2023 as extraordinary policy support is withdrawn, rising prices weigh on real income and consumption growth slows to more typical rates.'  It expects growth to slow to two per cent by the end of 2023, below the economy's long-term trend at just under three per cent.  'Increases in interest rates and consumer prices are anticipated to weigh on households' budgets over the forecast period, but the effect on consumption is expected to be cushioned by a decline in the household saving ratio,' it said.  As flagged earlier this week, the RBA expects inflation to hit six per cent by the end of the year, an upgrade from its 3.25 per cent prediction made three months ago.  This compared with the most recent result of 5.1 per cent, the fastest pace since 2001.  Underlying inflation is expected to lift to 4.75 per cent by December this year, well above the RBA's two to three per cent inflation target.   These forecasts, along with an expected drop in the unemployment rate to 3.5 per cent next year, assume a cash rate of 1.75 per cent in the December quarter of this year and 2.5 per cent a year later.  These cash rate assumptions are derived from surveys of professional economists and financial market pricing, it said. ",
    "1e464cb940c15e2718e167f2d70710a1f4239f5f99a30edd2aecbf57": "Amber Heard testified Thursday that one of her biggest fights with Johnny Depp began over an argument over his accusation that she slept with both her co-star and director on the Oscar-nominated film The Danish Girl.  Heard, 36, portrayed Ulla Paulson in the 2015 film, which was nominated for four Oscars. She claims Depp believed that she was sleeping with both co-star Eddie Redmayne and director Tom Hooper.  'I got that sense that he thought I was sleeping with the director, and then it was with the actor I was filming with,' Heard testified, clarifying that the actor she was referring to was Redmayne, who won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance. Heard said that she was not having an affair with either man but claimed Depp called her at her London hotel and became angry when she didn't immediately answer.  'We get into an argument. He was accusing me of [sleeping with] Eddie Redmayne. He thought I was working with Billy Bob Thornton but I'd already worked with him a year earlier. He was very upset about him.'  Heard said that Depp accused her of sleeping with Thornton on multiple occasions.   Heard broke down on the stand as she detailed how Johnny Depp sexually assaulted her with a liquor bottle during emotional testimony that the actor's defense team labeled the 'performance of her life.'  The alleged assault took place in March 2015 in Australia at their rented home he was living in while filming Pirates of the Caribbean 5. This is the same incident that saw Johnny Depp's finger severed. He claimed Heard threw a liquor bottle which severed it. Heard testified that she did not witness Depp's fingertip being cut off.  'At some point he's on top of me, screaming I f**king hate you, you ruined my f**king life,' Heard testified as she sobbed uncontrollably. 'I'm on the countertop, he had me by the neck and was on top of me. 'I'm looking in his eyes and I don't see him any more. It wasn't him, it was black. I haven't been so scared in my life. He was looking at me. I was trying to get through to him, to say in some way it was me. Trying to get through to Johnny. 'My head was bashing against the back of the bar and I couldn't breathe. I remember trying to get up to tell him he was really hurting me. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't get through to him. I couldn't get up.' At this point, Heard became overwhelmed with emotion on the stand.  'Next thing I remember I was bent over backwards on the bar, I was staring at the blue light. My back was on the countertop. I thought he was punching me. I felt this pressure on my pubic bone and I could feel his arm moving. It looked like he was punching me. I could just feel this pressure. 'I don't remember what I said, I just remember being really still, not wanting to move. I remember looking around the room, looking at all the broken bottles, broken glass and I remember not wanting to move because I didn't know if it was broken, I didn't know if the bottle that he had inside me was broken. 'I couldn't feel it, I didn't feel pain, I didn't feel anything. 'I saw so much broken glass I didn't know if he would know if it was broken or not and I remember thinking please go I hope it's not broken. I don't know how that ended. I don't know how I got off the countertop. 'I just remember being in the bathroom. I remember retching, the sound my voice was making. I lost control of my bladder. I remember just retching, there was blood on the floor.' Depp's team claimed the actress' tales of abuse have evolved with 'new and convenient details' and plan on exposing her lies on cross-examination.  Heard said that leading up to the fight Depp confirmed he had not slept not had he eaten. Heard said that Depp had taken 8-10 MDMA pills. She said, 'He confirmed he took that amount and he could take that amount. 8 or 10.' She said Depp continued accusing her of cheating on him. She said, 'He calls his agent, he calls a few people and he's screaming at them. I got a sense it was money, he got a sense people had been stealing from him. 'He was calling himself a wh**e, he'd been wh**ed out.' 'Next thing I remember is coming downstairs and looking for him. We had an interaction that I can't really describe, it didn't make a lot of sense to me. Just belligerent, throwing things, screaming at me. I realized I was back on the chopping block,' Heard said.  'He has me up against the wall, he slams me hard, I hit my head hard. This is the wall next to the kitchenette. There were these fridges and I remember being slammed up against those. I remember pushing him off of me. The name calling, the wh**e, the slut the fat a**. 'He was squeezing my neck. It got really nasty. It went from no one likes you, everyone warned me about you. He said everyone had warned him about me and he wished he'd never married me. That no one liked me. 'At some point I shoved him and he shoved me back. He said: 'Do you want to go little girl?'  Heard said she was struggling with him and he threw her across the room.  'I land on a games table. He gets on top of me on the games table and is just whacking me in the face, repetitive. We struggled. 'He's taunting me to take the bottle from him. He's holding out the bottle, the third time I get a hold of it, I slam it down on the ground between us. That really set him off. 'It was like a lightbulb switch went off. He starts screaming. I don't know if he backhanded me or hit me. It sent me down to the ground. By the time I picked myself off the floor he's got a bottle in his hand, he threw it at me, it missed. 'He had a broken bottle up against my face, neck area and he told me I'll carve up your face. It was terrifying. 'I remember him having me by the nightgown. I remember him throwing me around, I'm flailing. 'He's throwing these bottles at me. There's soda cans and they're coming at me one after another. I keep pulling myself into the bar area. He's standing in the only area you can exit. 'I can feel glass breaking behind me. I can remember being terrified. I couldn't move, I couldn't go anywhere. He ran out of things to throw, I ran to the exit and we got into this struggle by the bar area 'I remember my feet slipping on the tile as he was slamming me from the wall to the countertop. He had my nightgown and ripped it off my chest. 'He's teasing me he has my breasts in his hand, my nightgown came completely off, it was ripped off of me, I was naked. 'He's flinging me around. He's screaming at me he f**king hates me, I ruined his life. Over and over. He starts punching the wall next to my head, holding me by the neck. 'His energy shifted to the phone on the wall. He went from punching the wall, he picked up the phone - rahhhh! - screaming at the top of his lungs, I f**king hate you. He starts bashing the phone against the wall. 'Every time he pulled his hand back it was breaking into pieces, he's smashing it to smithereens.' Heard said that when she woke up the next day she could hear Marilyn Manson music blaring out of the speakers of the house. It 'became clear' that Depp had not slept. Heard said she saw brown writing on the walls that was in dried blood - there was blood on the carpet and brown letters that were messages to her. There was a 'giant penis' written on a painting and a table overturned. In the bar area where they had their fight the previous night there was broken glass everywhere. Heard said: 'He had his hand wrapped in these rags and I think he took them down or showed me, look what you made me do. Something to that effect. It was covered in paint. I put together he was using his finger - that's what he was using as a paintbrush.' Depp's security turned up and Heard tried to get him coffee but he threw the cup at the TV, she claimed.  Heard said, 'Johnny took his penis out of his pants and started trying to pee outside of the house saying he had more messages for me. His security looked at me and not laughed, played it off. It was like corralling a wild animal back into the house with his penis out of his pants. 'He went to pee on the wall of the house, saying he had more messages for me.' Heard added that there were 'mashed potatoes smeared all over the bedroom window and the door.' Later that night she found the steak she had been preparing for dinner when they got into their argument - pieces were all over the house. She said: 'I found the raw meat I'd left out, the steak, it was cut up and he'd ripped my nightgown into pieces and wrapped the meat up, wrapped the steak pieces up with my nightgown.' Heard detailed the lead up to the blowout fight. She said she and Depp had got married in February 2013 and that right after she flew to London to film The Danish Girl. Then in March she flew to Australia to join Depp while he was filming Pirates of the Caribbean 5. She said: 'I flew in all I wanted to do was see my new husband. He'd lost a ton of weight. I knew something was up. 'At some point early in that evening he pulls out a bag of MDMA. I was surprised because at the time that was, there was no question mark as to how I would respond. Why would you even think that's OK? 'He'd already gotten clean and sober. He seemed to suggest we should do it together. I was absolutely not. I want to see you and spend time with you. 'It was the exact opposite of what I wanted. It seemed delusional to suggest this. If you had been through what I'd been through it was crazy.' Heard said that they got into an argument - the first of many. She said: 'I shove past him, just stomp off. He grabs me. In my head I wasn't thinking of leaving yet but that would later be going through my mind 'I don't remember the exact sequence of things. I have a lot of flashes. 'The first night I distinctly remember at one point maybe I came back into the room but he shoved me. I went flying across these parakeet floors, just skidding. It looked so easy for him to throw me around like that. I just slid. 'We had another argument that was a spin off from that, it was this on-off sort of thing 'I remember he shoves me up against the fridge, he has me by the throat and was holding me there by my throat. He's bashing me against the wall next to the fridge. At some point I'm in his face, I remember slapping him across the face, screaming at him, screaming at me. 'I eventually barricaded the door. It wouldn't stop him from coming in, he could come in the other doors. At least I'd hear it. I just wanted to know if he came in.' Heard told the court that after they returned from Australia they reconciled but soon after she discovered he had cheated on her right after their wedding. She said that Depp passed out one day and she saw he had been texting another woman he had been seeing at the start of their relationship. Heard said that the date of their messages was 'right after the wedding', which took place in February 2015. Heard told the court that 'after touching down in Los Angeles' from the wedding in the Bahamas, 'the next day he went to this woman with whom he had a sexual relationship with.' She said: 'I freaked out. I immediately confronted him about it. I didn't care in that moment if he did kill me, which was likely in confronting him. I didn't care any more. He'd already ripped my heart out. 'From having been through it  in Australia weeks prior, I see this it was like....unbelievably painful, 'I'm yelling at him, calling him these ugly names, told him to get the f**k out the house. We were screaming at each other. I remember being so mad at him for cheating on me and doing so in this way, right after my wedding. 'It felt like everything came crashing down. I was so hurt,' During the row Heard called Depp a 'f**king pu**y' and he 'bolted' towards her. She said: 'He had his hand on the back of my hair and was yanking me down and hit me in the face with this cast. 'I remember this brief struggle we had before breakaway. Whitney, my sister, put herself between Johnny and I in the line of fire. 'Johnny swings at her, seeing my little sister and Johnny swings at her. I don't even wait for any other, in my head think of Kate Moss and stairs and I swung at him'. Heard was referring to her previous claims that Depp once pushed the supermodel, who he once dated, down the stairs. Depp shook his head as Heard made the claim. Heard said, 'All of my relationship to date to Johnny I hadn't landed a blow and for the first time I hit him square in the face. 'Johnny kind of looked stunned and laughed at me and lunged at me again and security stepped in between us and pulled Johnny away.' Heard said that after that Depp threw her clothing racks down the stairs, telling the court that 'everything he could touch he tried to destroy.' Heard claimed that during one fight in December 2015 Depp headbutted her and beat her so badly she thought she would die. She said that he told her: 'You really want to go now, tough guy' before punching her. She said: 'I look him right in the eyes. It was a really still moment.' '(He said) you want to go again, tough guy. I looked right up at his face, he balled up his face, leaned back and headbutted me square in the nose. 'Instantly (I felt) searing pain, It's one of the few memories I have of physical pain, searing pain'. Depp dragged Heard by the hair into a neighboring apartment, leaving chunks lying all over the floor. He got on top of her with her face in a pill and was repeatedly beating her. Heard said: 'He's trying to hold me with his knee on my back and he's punching me with a closed fist repeatedly. 'I remember the sound of Johnny's voice he got next to my ear and he was screaming over and over again I f**king hate you, I f**king hate you over and over. F**king hate you. Pounding the back of my head with his fist. 'I could hear myself scream until I couldn't hear myself any more I could just hear him say he was going to kill me and he sounded like an animal in pain when he was saying he f**king hated me. He sounded different like he was in agony. He just hit me over and over and over again. I got really still and it felt in my body quiet. 'I thought this is how I die, he's going to kill me now. He's going to kill me and he won't even have realized it. 'I couldn't breathe. I remember trying to scream and I couldn't scream suffocating in this pillow top with him holding me down punching me. I don't have any memory after that until I woke up.' February 3, 2015 Johnny Depp and Amber Heard marry in a private civil ceremony at their LA home, four years after they met as co-stars on the set of The Rum Diary. The couple celebrate with a lavish reception on an idyllic private island in the Bahamas that Depp bought in 2004 for $3.6 million. April 21, 2015 Heard breaches Australia's biosecurity laws when she and Depp fail to declare their two Yorkshire terriers when they arrive Down Under on a private jet for the filming of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Heard admits falsifying quarantine documents and is placed on a $1,000 one-month good behavior bond. May 23, 2016 Heard files for divorce after 15 months of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. Four days later a judge issues a temporary restraining order against Depp over domestic violence allegations. Pictures of Heard's alleged injuries hit the tabloids but the LAPD finds no evidence of a crime. August 16, 2016 Depp and Heard reach a $7 million divorce settlement which the actress promises to give to charity. Their marriage was 'intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,' the former lovers say in a statement. 'There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm'. December 18, 2018 The Washington Post publishes an op-ed by Heard, an ambassador for women's rights at for the American Civil Liberties Union, urging support for women who suffer domestic violence. 'Two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out,' reads the headline. March 1, 2019 Despite not being named in the article, Depp files a $50 million defamation suit in Fairfax Circuit Court, Virginia saying it implied he was an abuser and got him fired from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Depp dismisses Heard's abuse allegations as a 'hoax' and claims he was actually the victim of her violence. August 10, 2020 Heard countersues for $100 million, claiming vengeful Depp and his lawyer Adam Waldman targeted her with a vicious smear campaign, using media allies and internet trolls to amplify false stories about her and derail her acting career. November 1, 2020 Depp faces an uphill battle to save his reputation after he loses a libel battle with a British tabloid that labeled him a 'wife beater'. A judge in London's rules that The Sun's 2018 article was 'substantially true' and that the father-of-two had attacked Heard a dozen times, causing her to fear for her life on three occasions. April 11, 2022 After lengthy delays due to the Covid pandemic, the former flames finally lock horns in Fairfax County, Virginia where the Washington Post servers that published the disputed op-ed are based. The trial is expected to last six to seven weeks and celebrities tipped to give evidence include James Franco, Paul Bettany and Ellen Barkin.  ",

The schoolboy told his mum the new students had arrived to his school from Russia and Ukraine and spoke to his school assembly that day, in the video uploaded to TikTok by his mother, author Emmaline Carroll Southwell, 39. Ms Southwell amassed an online audience of more than 600,000 making TikToks featuring her three kids during Australia's lockdowns of the last two years. Her son told her three new people arrived at his school as she picked him up, filming the conversation in the car.  He also revealed the 'important' English words he will teach them first, as his mum struggled not to laugh.  'They're from a different country,' Ms Southwell's son said. 'Which one?' she asked. 'Ah, Russia or Ukraine. So they can keep safe from the war, they need somewhere else to live, they came in front of the whole school,' he answered. Ms Southwell then asked if they knew English, but was told they had learned a little bit. 'So they just need to learn a few more words in English?' she asked, prompting her son to inform her he would teach them some more words in English tomorrow. When asked what words he'd teach them, Ms Southwell's son replied, 'maybe important ones.' 'Like 'deez nuts' and 'yeet',' he said as Ms Southwell tried to hold back her laughter. 'Are they the important ones?' she asked him. 'Just some examples,' her son replied, telling her he would befriend the refugee students though they aren't in his year at school. Earlier in the month New South Wales Transport Minister David Elliot said 2,500 Ukrainians had arrived in NSW seeking refuge, as the humanitarian crisis in the country as a result of Russia's invasion had seen hundreds of thousands fleeing the nation. More Ukrainian refugees are expected to arrive in Australia as the war continues on in east Europe. In March Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced temporary humanitarian visas for Ukrainians who had already arrived in Australia, allowing them to stay for up to three years and be able to work, study and access Medicare. The federal government also announced an additional $30 million in humanitarian aid and $21 million in military support for Ukraine.",
    "3aac26225528773f714dfd1417eb6266b86247aa9f6dcdb2ef7e4ae4": "Anti-abortion activists took to the streets around Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's home in Alexandria, Virginia, Thursday to thank him for a draft opinion - that was leaked earlier this week - which would overturn Roe v Wade. On Monday, Politico reported the high court's intention to overturn the landmark 1973 abortion decision in Roe v Wade, which established women's constitutional right to an abortion.  Just days later, pictures emerged showing a group of anti-abortion activists marching up and down the leafy streets around Alito's Virginia home.  It was a welcome sign for the George W. Bush appointee, after reports surfaced of left-wing groups gearing up to target the justices' homes with protests over the leaked document. One noticeable sign Thursday read, 'Alito rocks,' while another said, 'The draft is genius.' The show of support comes as the the Supreme Court justice has canceled a public appearance that was scheduled to start Thursday. He was supposed to appear at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' judicial conference, a gathering of judges from the New Orleans-based federal appeals court and the district courts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Alito wrote in his opinion that it was an 'inescapable conclusion' that 'a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation's history and traditions.'  Following the leak, Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed that the document was legitimate.  Since then, both pro- and anti-abortion activists have protested nationwide, including outside of the Supreme Court building in Washington D.C.  Worries about those protests led to the construction of large metal fencing around the steps of the court.  On the other side of the spectrum, pro-abortion group Ruth Sent Us, named for the late Justice Ruth Ginsberg, has begun to plot protests outside of the conservative justice's homes.  The group published the supposed addresses of Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts and are planning a 'walk-by' of their homes next Wednesday, May 11. Ruth Sent Us' homepage greets visitors with an interactive map showing the location of the homes.  The blurb reads: 'ANNOUNCING: Walk-by Wednesday, May 11 2022! At the homes of the six extremist justices, three in Virginia and three in Maryland.' On their Twitter page, Ruth Sent Us, is described as 'We rise up against a corrupt and illegitimate Supreme Court.' ",

The Labor leader tested positive to Covid in late April and after a week of isolation he this week returned to the campaign trail ahead of the May 21 election. At a press conference on Friday, Mr Albanese was asked by Sky News reporter Trudy McIntosh about whether he was fit for polling day. Mr Albanese responded 'in terms of my health ... I think you've had Covid?' Ms McIntosh replied that she had to which Mr Albanese said: 'It has an impact doesn't it.' The reporter then cut in to say: 'I haven't needed to have a nap in the afternoon, you're running to be Prime Minister.' 'The question is are you match fit heading into polling day.'  Mr Albanese then rattled off various things he did on Thursday, including TV and radio interviews, attending a smart energy exhibition, several meetings, a speech at a lunch for the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a press conference and an appearance on Q&A. 'I think that's a heavy program,' he said. Moments before he was accused of sleeping on the job, Mr Albanese was interrupted by a little boy named Sammy. The Opposition leader was answering a question about what he would do to relieve the cost of living pressures before he noticed the child had walked up to him. 'Hello, what's your name?' he asked as he bent down to speak to the youngster. 'Where's your mum and dad,' Mr Albanese then said as the crowd laughed and Sammy's mother pulled him away. 'Thanks very much for that contribution.' The man vying for the country's top job was fired up at Friday's press conference and at one point chastised a reporter who asked him several times if he can guarantee no funding cuts to health, education or the NDIS. Mr Albanese initially replied: 'Labor will always be better on health, education and NDIS' before the journalist said: 'That is not a guarantee you won't cut it though, Mr Albanese?' The Labor leader then said he has committed 'additional funding' for those areas but the reporter again asked him to guarantee no cuts. At that point Mr Albanese fired up, saying: 'Wait. Seriously. This is an example of what putting people off politics. 'You cannot have a clearer answer than that Labor is putting additional funding into health, education and the NDIS, and we stand by it. 'And you know what puts people off politics? That sort of word game. It can't be clearer. We stand by our additional funding that. That is not a cut. That is more funding.' Mr Albanese also dodged a question on whether he made a mistake on Thursday by failing to outline his six-point plan for the NDIS until an advisor handed him a policy document. Faced with constant interruptions, he told the journalists: 'I'm in charge'. One journalist said: 'If you can't stand up to us, how can you stand up to Xi Jinping?' - which he ignored. ",

A Labor Party spokesperson on Thursday said an Albanese government would ban the trade, adding it had been in decline for the past two decades. 'An elected Albanese Labor Government will phase out live sheep exports in consultation with the industry and the West Australian Government on what needs to happen given this decline,' they said in a statement.  Mark McGowan - the Labor premier of WA where the industry is concentrated - slammed the idea, saying current policy settings were fine and there was no need for a ban. 'We put in place rules that required a suspension of exports over the northern summer because of the shocking outcomes that were occurring, particularly in the summer months, up in the Persian Gulf,' he told reporters on Thursday. 'And then were was additional vet checks and additional monitoring put in place on some of the ships. I think those measures are effective and I think they're appropriate.'    Mr Albanese on Friday contradicted the comments from the Labor spokesperson, saying while there had been a change to Labor's policy it did not mean an end to live exports all together. 'The amount of live exports has halved in recent times and we'll continue the summer ban,' he told reporters in Sydney on Friday. 'We will consult with state governments, in particular the Western Australian state government, but we'll also consult with the agricultural sector about about the issues around live sheep exports.'  The RSPCA says live exporting sheep - mostly to the Middle East - is incompatible with basic animal welfare standards. Footage of the Awassi Express - a ship where more than 2,400 sheep died in 2017 - caused outrage when it was broadcast nationally.",

It's the second time the Victorian Premier has been hauled into a private hearing by the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission, sparking renewed calls for him to stand down as leader. In the latest round of secret hearings, Mr Andrews was quizzed about his associations with Ferrari-driving property developer John Woodman, who's under investigation from IBAC for allegedly corrupt land deals with Casey councillors in Melbourne's south-east. It's understood IBAC is probing connections between the Premier and the developer who have attended the same political fundraising functions and whether large donations led to privileged access at a ministerial level, The Australian reported. Another focus of the probe is whether Mr Andrews was given the property developer's phone number.  Mr Andrews initially told the inquiry veteran Labor lobbyist Philip Staindl may have provided him with Mr Woodman's mobile number. He later changed his testimony and told the hearing it was highly unlikely he would have requested or was given the developer's contact details. Mr Andrews has previously denied any association with Mr Woodman. A government spokesman declined to respond to questions due to the active IBAC investigation. The secret hearing was part of IBAC investigation Operation Sandon into allegations of corrupt conduct involving Casey councillors and property developers. 'The Operation Sandon draft special report is currently going through a natural justice process,' a spokesman said. 'This process provides people involved in the investigation with a reasonable opportunity to respond to material relating to them. IBAC will not making any further comment on the investigation.' Victorian Opposition Leader Matthew Guy has renewed calls for Mr Andrews to 'do the decent thing' and step down until IBAC hands down its report. He also demanded Mr Andrews answer questions regarding his latest IBAC secret hearing. 'I think the Premier should answer those questions. He's the one that's been interviewed,' Mr Guy said on Friday. 'The Premier always says when it comes to other politicians, federal, state or otherwise, well, they've got questions to answer. 'Well now he does. How about he answer those questions? 'How many times has he been interviewed, on what topics and is he the one that asked to be interviewed in secret, and if so, why, what has he got to hide?' It was revealed last week Mr Andrews was secretly questioned by the state's anti-corruption watchdog as part of a separate investigation into the Labor Party. A draft report has revealed Mr Andrews is among several senior figures that privately admitted 'significant cultural reform is required within the ALP'.  IBAC spoke to 26 witnesses, including the premier, as well as seven others in public hearings. The Premier has repeatedly refused to comment on his involvement with the probe that found wrongdoing and the likely misuse of publicly funded staff across Labor's factions.",

People living at Bonogin in the Gold Coast hinterland, Queensland, claimed they had been parking in the same spots for the past 10 years without issue.    One couple told Nine News Gold Coast they recently discovered they had been fined $510 for parking their ute on the grass in front of their property.  They have expressed the situation as 'just ridiculous.'  A neighbour was also issued with a fine. 'Parking on your front lawn and cop a fine for it, it's just crazy,' he said. Council has said inspectors do not inspect the area unless they have been dobbed in by another neighbour.  The Bonogin locals live in a semi-rural area on a no-through road with no footpaths and rarely have anyone walk through the street. According to the letter of the law residents must not block the nature strip in a built-up area with their vehicles. But locals argue their street does not constitute a built-up area.  Gold Coast Council Mayor Tom Tate has come out in favour of the residents. 'If it is safe, then they should leave it alone,' he said.

    "d53346b7f3510c16a134eda5705259148fed63e715c30aa3fccfadaf": "Video of vending machines dispensing menstrual products in boys bathrooms at Oregon school have begun to surface after  Governor Kate Brown signed the controversial Menstrual Dignity Act into law.  The new law will require elementary, middle and high schools to put menstrual products and instructions into all bathrooms on campus, regardless of gender. A TikTok video shot this month apparently shows a functioning tampon dispenser inside of a boys bathroom, showing that the process of installing the machines has already begun.  Oregon is the first state to pass such a law. All bathrooms must be fitted with menstrual product machines by June 2023. The Menstrual Dignity Act passed in the Oregon legislature in 2021. According to the law: 'All education providers shall install in every bathroom at least one dispenser that does not require coins or money' and 'is clearly marked as free in at least two languages.' When asked about the act in an April 2022 interview with Oregon Public Broadcasting, Oregon Department of Education director Colt Gill said that the act was designed to help school districts 'to understand how they can be supportive of all students' and 'what pronouns that they choose to use at school.' Gill said that if a district is not in compliance with the new law, students are invited to contact the Oregon Department of Education. He added: 'We are happy to come in and help the school district and the community understand the laws that are in place.' A statement from the state's biggest school district, Portland Public Schools, addressed the new law saying that their schools would have menstrual products available in all bathrooms by the start of the 2022-23 school year.  The Daily Mail reached out to both Portland Public Schools and the Oregon Department of Education for comment on this story but has yet to hear back.   The release continued, 'We encourage parents to have conversations with their students at home about menstruation, menstrual products, sexuality and health.'  It continues, 'This program will be implemented best if we work in partnership to reduce shame and stigma around menstruation and help all students address basic physical needs in order to remove barriers to their overall education.'  At the time the law passed the legislature, the Oregon Department of Education released a statement citing a similar law in New York City that saw an increase of 2.4 percent in attendance following the implementation.  After the bill was signed into law, the Family Research Council released a statement which read in part, 'Thanks to the Menstrual Dignity Act that just passed in Oregon, local taxpayers are now on the hook for thousands of new tampon dispensers in boys bathrooms.' When a similar bill in was up for debate in the Illinois legislature, state Rep. Avery Bourne (R) said, ''When you give a grade-school boy something that's adhesive, they're going to put it in places. These products are not inexpensive, and they are going to be misused if they are placed in elementary school boys' bathrooms.'",

The Labor leader - who has been called 'weak' by Scott Morrison - appeared fired-up up during the presser in his home suburb of Marrickville, inner west Sydney.  He dodged a question on whether he made a mistake on Thursday by failing to outline his six-point plan for the NDIS until an advisor handed him a policy document. And faced with constant interruptions, he told one journalist 'you've had your opportunity so just wait' and 'I'm in charge'.  In one tense exchange he ripped into a reporter who asked him several times if he can guarantee no funding cuts to health, education or the NDIS.  Mr Albanese initially replied: 'Labor will always be better on health, education and NDIS' before the journalist said: 'That is not a guarantee you won't cut it though, Mr Albanese?'

'And you know what puts people off politics? That sort of word game. It can't be clearer. We stand by our additional funding that. That is not a cut. That is more funding.' Mr Albanese's Labor colleagues have accused the press pack of 'gotcha journalism' for asking him to name his six-point plan for the NDIS. But Mr Albanese insisted: 'People are entitled to ask questions'. One journalist said: 'If you can't stand up to us, how can you stand up to Xi Jinping?' - which he ignored.   Mr Albanese was also quizzed on his health after he isolated with Covid last week, with one reporter accusing him of needing an 'afternoon nap'. Asked if he is 'still going to need to rest into polling day' Mr Albanese said Covid 'has an impact doesn't it'. The reporter replied: 'I haven't needed to have a nap in the afternoon, you're running to be Prime Minister. The question is, are you match fit going into polling day?' The Labor leader then reeled off a list of engagements he had undertaken to prove he is match fit.  Campaigning in Perth, Mr Morrison said his opponent's mistakes showed Labor was 'weak'. 'Australians are really starting to ask the question - is Anthony Albanese really up to this,' he said.  'If Anthony Albanese thinks the campaign is hard, I've got news for him - government's a lot harder.' Earlier on Friday Allison Langdon blasted Mr Albanese for his NDIS gaffe. In an interview with Labor deputy leader Richard Marles on the Today show, the Channel Nine host said: 'I reckon detail is his kryptonite'.  In his press conferences this week Mr Albanese has been deferring questions about Labor policies to the shadow minister responsible, leading to accusations that he's not across the details. On Thursday he was unable to name his six-point plan for the NDIS and had to read from a policy document which an advisor handed to him off camera.  One Labor MP speaking anonymously said he 'needs to get across the details' and another described the presser as a 'train-wreck'.  Langdon said: 'It's not just yesterday, it happened on Monday and Tuesday as well just this week.'  Mr Marles then stuttered as he tried to defend his leader's gaffes before saying: 'It's not a pop quiz. We've got policies on our website.' Langdon cut him off and said: 'So hang on, what do you mean by that... detail is not important is that what you're saying?' Marles replied: 'At the end of the day this is contest about ideas and when you're talking about the NDIS the issue there is that people with a disability are no longer in the centre of the system.' Defence Minister Peter Dutton said the gaffe showed it was a 'huge risk' to vote Labor. 'You risk what we've got in our country at the moment to a complete unknown and frankly someone who is he is not up to the task,' he said.  Mr Albanese on Thursday faced a pack of reporters in Sydney where, in response to a barrage of questions, he failed to outline his six-point NDIS plan. He could only say 'we will put people a the centre of the NDIS' before one reporter shouted: 'You do not know your own policy Mr Albanese'.  After a few more questions on different topics, Mr Albanese went off camera and journalists saw an advisor hand him a document. ",
    "5b0a6d3ff7c9b4795a2f37a64b9a3ad2e83bf60da0b93e7163a3e2ca": "Parents of a six-year-old boy who recently completed a full-length marathon are being condemned for making the child run alongside them in the race and are being accused of bribing him to keep moving when he was struggling. Runners must be 18 years old to participate in the Flying Pig Marathon, a 26.2-mile race in Cincinnati, Ohio. But on Sunday, Rainer, a six-year-old from Bellevue, Kentucky, completed the entire race with his parents, Ben and Kami Crawford. It took him more than 8.5 hours.  The Crawfords, a family-of-eight, who chronicle their adventures on a YouTube Channel, have a prominent presence on social media, and once wrote a book about being the largest family to hike the Appalachian Trail. But this was their first marathon as a family.  The parents and race organizers, who said they were aware of the child participating, received swift backlash online after the race, with US Olympian Kara Goucher saying six is too young for a marathon.  'I don't know who needs to hear this but a six year old cannot fathom what a marathon will do to them physically,' Goucher said on her verified Twitter account. 'A six year old does not understand what embracing misery is. A six year who is 'struggling physically' does not realize they have the right to stop and should.'  Goucher, a two-time Olympian who competed in the 10,000 meters in Beijing in 2008 and as a marathoner in the 2012 London Games, went on to say: 'I'm not questioning motivation or saying it is bad parenting. But as an Olympic athlete, I promise you this is not good for the child.' 'Children are children. Let them run around, but as the parent you need to protect their growing bodies and their young minds,' she added The child's father posted on Instagram that Rainer had been 'struggling physically and wanted to take a break and sit every three minutes.'  The post continued: 'After 7 hours, we finally got to mile 20 and only to find an abandoned table and empty boxes. He was crying and we were moving slow, so I told him I'd buy him two sleeves [of Pringles] if he kept moving.'  But the parents defended their decision in a lengthy Facebook post on Tuesday, as they addresses concerns and recognized their unconventional parenting methods. 'We have never forced any of our children to run a marathon and we cannot even imagine that as feasible practically or emotionally,' the Crawford parents wrote. 'We have given all of our kids the option for every race. Last year two kids ran it without us. In 9 years we have been awarded a total of 53 medals - mostly to the kids.  'This year after begging to join us we allowed our 6 year old to train and attempt it. Both parents gave him a 50/50 chance of completing it and were ready to pull the plug at any moment if he requested it or if we viewed his safety at risk.  'We asked him numerous times if he wanted to stop and he was VERY clear that his preference was to continue. We did not see any sign of heat exhaustion or dehydration and honored his request to keep on going.'  Flying Pig Executive Director Iris Simpson Bush responded to the backlash in an open letter published Wednesday.  'The intent was to try to offer protection and support if they were on our course (Medical, Fluids and Replenishment).' the letter read. 'Our decision was intended for some amount of safety and protection for the child. The family finished the race after the formal closure of the race course.' Race organizers say they plan to enforce the age limits moving forward.  On May 1 our family of 8 finished an entire 26.2 mile marathon. This is the first marathon our entire family has run together. Our 5 older kids waited for over an hour at mile 25 and after 8 hours and 35 minutes we all crossed the finish line together. After 2 days celebrating with friends, how we spent our day has got a lot of attention from some who are accusing us of being irresponsible and even abusive. To that end I'd like to lay out a few facts for the public conversation. 1. We have never forced any of our children to run a marathon and we cannot even imagine that as feasible practically or emotionally. We have given all of our kids the option for every race. Last year two kids ran it without us. In 9 years we have been awarded a total of 53 medals - mostly to the kids. This year after begging to join us we allowed our 6 year old to train and attempt it. Both parents gave him a 50/50 chance of completing it and were ready to pull the plug at any moment if he requested it or if we viewed his safety at risk. We asked him numerous times if he wanted to stop and he was VERY clear that his preference was to continue. We did not see any sign of heat exhaustion or dehydration and honored his request to keep on going. 2. Yes there were tears. He had a fall and every single member of our family has cried during marathons. These experiences were very limited compared to what has been reported and despite the incredible physical and emotional difficulty of running a marathon the amount of his crying is comparable to what we would have experienced had we stayed home on a Sunday morning. Many people are inaccurately reporting that people saw him for the 'entire' or 'majority' of the race crying and that there are numerous witnesses. With our finishing time this is impossible as we finished the last 5 miles predominately alone and most people's experience with us was in a one time passing of 30 seconds. Those making these confident and absolute assertions do not have any evidence. We have hours of video footage and images that will be released that depict his emotional state very clearly. 3. For those that claim we force our kids to run for the clicks or the money, these claims are unsubstantiated. We've been running before the clicks and our videos make on average $10-$30 a day. It barely pays for the equipment. We go to great lengths to prioritize our kids' health and experience of the day over sharing it to anyone else. Communicating these stories is a passion project that we do with our children's cooperation and permission. 4. Finally, no single post is meant to capture the full scope of our parenting methods or what happened on marathon day. They capture one moment or feeling. You cannot bribe a child to train hundreds of hours and run 26 miles through the heat for a can of pringles. If you can't see this you are lazy or not listening. We have hundreds of hours of video that detail the process we use for running and it's about as far from coercion or force as it comes. Yes, negotiation and incentivization are parenting methods we use but these are used sparingly with care. Our parenting methods are unconventional but we do not think accusations or arguments with incorrect facts are helpful. We're thankful to those who supported us on race day. It was an incredible experience and we can't wait to share more. Ben & Kami     ",
    "b79cef4cdef57d5953053907c4686a6c1faaf0b62933c7d1579a3780": "Amber Heard testified Thursday that she felt protective over Johnny Depp's daughter Lily-Rose and fought the actor over his questionable parenting, including allowing an unnamed older musician the teen had a crush on stay at their house and introducing her to marijuana at a young age. Heard, 36, said she felt protective of Lily-Rose, now herself an actress, and got into an argument with Depp when he allowed an unnamed music star whom his teen daughter 'had a crush on' to sleep over. This happened despite the star, Heard claims, being well over 18 and Lily-Rose being underage.  'This argument happened because I didn't agree that this gentleman - a famous musician over the age of 18 - spent the night at the house and I felt protective over Lily-Rose and concerned and naturally, they were not might children, it's not my place and I understand it, I know it's a sensitive subject so I understand why Johnny got so upset with me.' She said that moments like this and the fact that Johnny introduced Lily-Rose - now 22 - to marijuana as early as the age of 14 made her begin to feel protective over her.   'I started to feel very protective. Johnny's sobriety meant that he was there and then he wasn't,' she said. 'The nature of our lives with the travel and the work meant he was there and then he wasn't.' 'She was so young, I just felt protective.'   Heard broke down on the stand earlier Thursday as she detailed how Johnny Depp sexually assaulted her with a liquor bottle during emotional testimony that the actor's defense team labeled the 'performance of her life.'  The alleged assault took place in March 2015 in Australia at their rented home he was living in while filming Pirates of the Caribbean 5. This is the same incident that saw Johnny Depp's finger severed. He claimed Heard threw a liquor bottle which severed it. Heard testified that she did not witness Depp's fingertip being cut off.  'At some point he's on top of me, screaming I f**king hate you, you ruined my f**king life,' Heard testified as she sobbed uncontrollably. 'I'm on the countertop, he had me by the neck and was on top of me. 'I'm looking in his eyes and I don't see him any more. It wasn't him, it was black. I haven't been so scared in my life. He was looking at me. I was trying to get through to him, to say in some way it was me. Trying to get through to Johnny. 'My head was bashing against the back of the bar and I couldn't breathe. I remember trying to get up to tell him he was really hurting me. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't get through to him. I couldn't get up.' At this point, Heard became overwhelmed with emotion on the stand.  'Next thing I remember I was bent over backwards on the bar, I was staring at the blue light. My back was on the countertop. I thought he was punching me. I felt this pressure on my pubic bone and I could feel his arm moving. It looked like he was punching me. I could just feel this pressure. 'I don't remember what I said, I just remember being really still, not wanting to move. I remember looking around the room, looking at all the broken bottles, broken glass and I remember not wanting to move because I didn't know if it was broken, I didn't know if the bottle that he had inside me was broken. 'I couldn't feel it, I didn't feel pain, I didn't feel anything. 'I saw so much broken glass I didn't know if he would know if it was broken or not and I remember thinking please go I hope it's not broken. I don't know how that ended. I don't know how I got off the countertop. 'I just remember being in the bathroom. I remember retching, the sound my voice was making. I lost control of my bladder. I remember just retching, there was blood on the floor.' Depp's team claimed the actress' tales of abuse have evolved with 'new and convenient details' and plan on exposing her lies on cross-examination.  Heard said that leading up to the fight Depp confirmed he had not slept not had he eaten. 'We get into an argument. He was accusing me of (sleeping with) Eddie Redmayne (her co-star in The Danish Girl). He thought I was working with Billy Bob Thornton but I'd already worked with him a year earlier. He was very upset about him.' Heard said that Depp had taken 8-10 MDMA pills. She said, 'He confirmed he took that amount and he could take that amount. 8 or 10.' She said Depp continued accusing her of cheating on him. She said, 'He calls his agent, he calls a few people and he's screaming at them. I got a sense it was money, he got a sense people had been stealing from him. 'He was calling himself a wh**e, he'd been wh**ed out.' 'Next thing I remember is coming downstairs and looking for him. We had an interaction that I can't really describe, it didn't make a lot of sense to me. Just belligerent, throwing things, screaming at me. I realized I was back on the chopping block,' Heard said.  'He has me up against the wall, he slams me hard, I hit my head hard. This is the wall next to the kitchenette. There were these fridges and I remember being slammed up against those. I remember pushing him off of me. The name calling, the wh**e, the slut the fat a**. 'He was squeezing my neck. It got really nasty. It went from no one likes you, everyone warned me about you. He said everyone had warned him about me and he wished he'd never married me. That no one liked me. 'At some point I shoved him and he shoved me back. He said: 'Do you want to go little girl?'  Heard said she was struggling with him and he threw her across the room.  'I land on a games table. He gets on top of me on the games table and is just whacking me in the face, repetitive. We struggled. 'He's taunting me to take the bottle from him. He's holding out the bottle, the third time I get a hold of it, I slam it down on the ground between us. That really set him off. 'It was like a lightbulb switch went off. He starts screaming. I don't know if he backhanded me or hit me. It sent me down to the ground. By the time I picked myself off the floor he's got a bottle in his hand, he threw it at me, it missed. 'He had a broken bottle up against my face, neck area and he told me I'll carve up your face. It was terrifying. 'I remember him having me by the nightgown. I remember him throwing me around, I'm flailing. 'He's throwing these bottles at me. There's soda cans and they're coming at me one after another. I keep pulling myself into the bar area. He's standing in the only area you can exit. 'I can feel glass breaking behind me. I can remember being terrified. I couldn't move, I couldn't go anywhere. He ran out of things to throw, I ran to the exit and we got into this struggle by the bar area 'I remember my feet slipping on the tile as he was slamming me from the wall to the countertop. He had my nightgown and ripped it off my chest. 'He's teasing me he has my breasts in his hand, my nightgown came completely off, it was ripped off of me, I was naked. 'He's flinging me around. He's screaming at me he f**king hates me, I ruined his life. Over and over. He starts punching the wall next to my head, holding me by the neck. 'His energy shifted to the phone on the wall. He went from punching the wall, he picked up the phone - rahhhh! - screaming at the top of his lungs, I f**king hate you. He starts bashing the phone against the wall. 'Every time he pulled his hand back it was breaking into pieces, he's smashing it to smithereens.' Heard said that when she woke up the next day she could hear Marilyn Manson music blaring out of the speakers of the house. It 'became clear' that Depp had not slept. Heard said she saw brown writing on the walls that was in dried blood - there was blood on the carpet and brown letters that were messages to her. There was a 'giant penis' written on a painting and a table overturned. In the bar area where they had their fight the previous night there was broken glass everywhere. Heard said: 'He had his hand wrapped in these rags and I think he took them down or showed me, look what you made me do. Something to that effect. It was covered in paint. I put together he was using his finger - that's what he was using as a paintbrush.' Depp's security turned up and Heard tried to get him coffee but he threw the cup at the TV, she claimed.  Heard said, 'Johnny took his penis out of his pants and started trying to pee outside of the house saying he had more messages for me. His security looked at me and not laughed, played it off. It was like corralling a wild animal back into the house with his penis out of his pants. 'He went to pee on the wall of the house, saying he had more messages for me.' Heard added that there were 'mashed potatoes smeared all over the bedroom window and the door.' Later that night she found the steak she had been preparing for dinner when they got into their argument - pieces were all over the house. She said: 'I found the raw meat I'd left out, the steak, it was cut up and he'd ripped my nightgown into pieces and wrapped the meat up, wrapped the steak pieces up with my nightgown.' Heard detailed the lead up to the blowout fight. She said she and Depp had got married in February 2013 and that right after she flew to London to film The Danish Girl. Then in March she flew to Australia to join Depp while he was filming Pirates of the Caribbean 5. She said: 'I flew in all I wanted to do was see my new husband. He'd lost a ton of weight. I knew something was up. 'At some point early in that evening he pulls out a bag of MDMA. I was surprised because at the time that was, there was no question mark as to how I would respond. Why would you even think that's OK? 'He'd already gotten clean and sober. He seemed to suggest we should do it together. I was absolutely not. I want to see you and spend time with you. 'It was the exact opposite of what I wanted. It seemed delusional to suggest this. If you had been through what I'd been through it was crazy.' Heard said that they got into an argument - the first of many. She said: 'I shove past him, just stomp off. He grabs me. In my head I wasn't thinking of leaving yet but that would later be going through my mind 'I don't remember the exact sequence of things. I have a lot of flashes. 'The first night I distinctly remember at one point maybe I came back into the room but he shoved me. I went flying across these parakeet floors, just skidding. It looked so easy for him to throw me around like that. I just slid. 'We had another argument that was a spin off from that, it was this on-off sort of thing 'I remember he shoves me up against the fridge, he has me by the throat and was holding me there by my throat. He's bashing me against the wall next to the fridge. At some point I'm in his face, I remember slapping him across the face, screaming at him, screaming at me. 'I eventually barricaded the door. It wouldn't stop him from coming in, he could come in the other doors. At least I'd hear it. I just wanted to know if he came in.' Heard told the court that after they returned from Australia they reconciled but soon after she discovered he had cheated on her right after their wedding. She said that Depp passed out one day and she saw he had been texting another woman he had been seeing at the start of their relationship. Heard said that the date of their messages was 'right after the wedding', which took place in February 2015. Heard told the court that 'after touching down in Los Angeles' from the wedding in the Bahamas, 'the next day he went to this woman with whom he had a sexual relationship with.' She said: 'I freaked out. I immediately confronted him about it. I didn't care in that moment if he did kill me, which was likely in confronting him. I didn't care any more. He'd already ripped my heart out. 'From having been through it  in Australia weeks prior, I see this it was like....unbelievably painful, 'I'm yelling at him, calling him these ugly names, told him to get the f**k out the house. We were screaming at each other. I remember being so mad at him for cheating on me and doing so in this way, right after my wedding. 'It felt like everything came crashing down. I was so hurt,' During the row Heard called Depp a 'f**king pu**y' and he 'bolted' towards her. She said: 'He had his hand on the back of my hair and was yanking me down and hit me in the face with this cast. 'I remember this brief struggle we had before breakaway. Whitney, my sister, put herself between Johnny and I in the line of fire. 'Johnny swings at her, seeing my little sister and Johnny swings at her. I don't even wait for any other, in my head think of Kate Moss and stairs and I swung at him'. Heard was referring to her previous claims that Depp once pushed the supermodel, who he once dated, down the stairs. Depp shook his head as Heard made the claim. Heard said, 'All of my relationship to date to Johnny I hadn't landed a blow and for the first time I hit him square in the face. 'Johnny kind of looked stunned and laughed at me and lunged at me again and security stepped in between us and pulled Johnny away.' Heard said that after that Depp threw her clothing racks down the stairs, telling the court that 'everything he could touch he tried to destroy.' Heard claimed that during one fight in December 2015 Depp headbutted her and beat her so badly she thought she would die. She said that he told her: 'You really want to go now, tough guy' before punching her. She said: 'I look him right in the eyes. It was a really still moment.' '(He said) you want to go again, tough guy. I looked right up at his face, he balled up his face, leaned back and headbutted me square in the nose. 'Instantly (I felt) searing pain, It's one of the few memories I have of physical pain, searing pain'. Depp dragged Heard by the hair into a neighboring apartment, leaving chunks lying all over the floor. He got on top of her with her face in a pill and was repeatedly beating her. Heard said: 'He's trying to hold me with his knee on my back and he's punching me with a closed fist repeatedly. 'I remember the sound of Johnny's voice he got next to my ear and he was screaming over and over again I f**king hate you, I f**king hate you over and over. F**king hate you. Pounding the back of my head with his fist. 'I could hear myself scream until I couldn't hear myself any more I could just hear him say he was going to kill me and he sounded like an animal in pain when he was saying he f**king hated me. He sounded different like he was in agony. He just hit me over and over and over again. I got really still and it felt in my body quiet. 'I thought this is how I die, he's going to kill me now. He's going to kill me and he won't even have realized it. 'I couldn't breathe. I remember trying to scream and I couldn't scream suffocating in this pillow top with him holding me down punching me. I don't have any memory after that until I woke up.' February 3, 2015 Johnny Depp and Amber Heard marry in a private civil ceremony at their LA home, four years after they met as co-stars on the set of The Rum Diary. The couple celebrate with a lavish reception on an idyllic private island in the Bahamas that Depp bought in 2004 for $3.6 million. April 21, 2015 Heard breaches Australia's biosecurity laws when she and Depp fail to declare their two Yorkshire terriers when they arrive Down Under on a private jet for the filming of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Heard admits falsifying quarantine documents and is placed on a $1,000 one-month good behavior bond. May 23, 2016 Heard files for divorce after 15 months of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. Four days later a judge issues a temporary restraining order against Depp over domestic violence allegations. Pictures of Heard's alleged injuries hit the tabloids but the LAPD finds no evidence of a crime. August 16, 2016 Depp and Heard reach a $7 million divorce settlement which the actress promises to give to charity. Their marriage was 'intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,' the former lovers say in a statement. 'There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm'. December 18, 2018 The Washington Post publishes an op-ed by Heard, an ambassador for women's rights at for the American Civil Liberties Union, urging support for women who suffer domestic violence. 'Two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out,' reads the headline. March 1, 2019 Despite not being named in the article, Depp files a $50 million defamation suit in Fairfax Circuit Court, Virginia saying it implied he was an abuser and got him fired from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Depp dismisses Heard's abuse allegations as a 'hoax' and claims he was actually the victim of her violence. August 10, 2020 Heard countersues for $100 million, claiming vengeful Depp and his lawyer Adam Waldman targeted her with a vicious smear campaign, using media allies and internet trolls to amplify false stories about her and derail her acting career. November 1, 2020 Depp faces an uphill battle to save his reputation after he loses a libel battle with a British tabloid that labeled him a 'wife beater'. A judge in London's rules that The Sun's 2018 article was 'substantially true' and that the father-of-two had attacked Heard a dozen times, causing her to fear for her life on three occasions. April 11, 2022 After lengthy delays due to the Covid pandemic, the former flames finally lock horns in Fairfax County, Virginia where the Washington Post servers that published the disputed op-ed are based. The trial is expected to last six to seven weeks and celebrities tipped to give evidence include James Franco, Paul Bettany and Ellen Barkin.  ",
    "2e9139cc73eb4b86833109b3deb18c47c7414384b9312ab9328a08ea": "A female relief teacher accused of grooming a teenage schoolboy is a talented athlete who worked at several schools in her hometown after finishing university.  Ammy Singleton, 28, faced a South Australian court on Wednesday after being charged with communicating with a child to 'make them amenable to sexual activity' between November 1 and 30 last year. The matter was adjourned until July after the prosecutor told the court police need 12 more weeks to analyse electronic evidence. A male student from a Port Augusta primary school where Ms Singleton taught for over a year said she allowed students to swear during lessons. 'She was a nice teacher, she actually used to let us swear a lot in class,' the Flinders View Primary School student told The Advertiser. Ms Singleton taught the boy Aboriginal language lessons for two days a week and in total taught at six local schools. Ms Singleton, who grew up in Port Augusta, north of Adelaide, was a star netballer and footballer in the rural town before moving three-and-a-half hours southeast to attend UniSA in Adelaide. She graduated with a Bachelor of Education (Primary and Middle) in 2017, before returning to her hometown where sources said she was employed at several schools. Ms Singleton, who graduated from South Australia's National Football League Aboriginal Pathways to Excellence Traineeship Program in 2012, built a reputation as a local sporting icon, The Advertiser reports.  She was lauded as a 'role model' in 2013 by locals after helping to organise a community basketball event.  Esther Boles, who led the SA under-18 girls team in 2018, said she was an inspiration to younger generations of women.  'Ammy Singleton and Mikayla Grantham were two girls that I watched growing up, as well as Ellie and Laura Packard, who are now very talented in other sports,' Ms Boles told the Transcontinental at the time. Since moving back, Ms Singleton has returned to sport, playing for the Railways Netball Club and in the Falcons Black basketball grand final last year.  When she hit the netball court last September, she was lauded as 'awesome in her court coverage for interceptions, back-up play and goal circle rebounds'.  She was arrested on December 23, before first appearing in court on February 14 this year. Ms Singleton has so far refused to comment.  The scandal has rocked the small tight-knit coastal town, which is home to almost 14,000 people.   Mayor Brett Benbow called on the community to let the court process run its course after one school issued a letter to parents.  'When it is all said and done, we will know a lot more about the circumstances,' Mayor Benbow said. 'I come back to the fact that this case is before the courts and that the person involved remains innocent until proven guilty.' Flinders View Principal Anna Nayda sent a letter to parents confirmed Ms Singleton was arrested for 'an alleged child sexual offence' and that she had worked there between February 2017 and April 2018. The letter said the allegations did not involve any of the school's students.  Port Augusta West Primary School's principal David Lawton issued a letter to parents earlier this year to inform them Ms Singleton had worked at the school for one day in July, 2020. 'Police have advised the Department for Education they do not have any objections to the department informing the school community,' he said. 'This incident does not involve any students at our school and the information available to the school suggests there is no need for any concern for any children at our school.' 'Ms Singleton has bail conditions that prevent her from engaging in any child-related work.  'If you have any concerns about the safety and welfare of your child, please feel free to contact me directly at the school.' Catholic Education South Australia this week confirmed in a statement Ms Singleton has never been employed at their school, Caritas College, in Port Augusta.  It remains unclear whether the alleged victim was a student she met while teaching. Ms Singleton will front Port Augusta Court again on July 20, where she is due to enter a plea. ",
    "d16bde1abc58b8e0a20a0d3afa00ab33dcee5f263cd9d44e59b3fef7": "One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has received a surprise ahead of Mother's Day this Sunday when she was declared 'Mother of the Year'.  The news came as a complete shock to Ms Hanson, who did not have any idea that she had been nominated in the first place. The mother of four was selected by Christian organisation Family Voice. The organisation believed she was a worthy recipient due to her ongoing commitment to her family, community and country.  Ms Hanson told The Daily Telegraph that she was 'very honoured' to win but she was 'totally surprised.' After recently being on the road campaigning, the One Nation leader said a sleep-in on Mother's Day is on the cards, as well as spending quality time with her children. 'You're never over being a mother until the day you die,' she said.  'The children may be adults but they come to you for guidance, advice and support they need throughout their lives.'  Following backlash over last year's decision by charity Barnardos to stop running the award after 25 years, Family Voice came to the rescue and took over.  The award through Family Voice was launched on 2GB last year with inaugural winner Leila Abdallah, who lost three of her children after a drunk and drugged driver hit them on a street in Sydney's west. NSW director of Family Voice Australia Greg Bondar said that Ms Hanson had shown the importance mothers play in the development of her children. The award recognised Ms Hanson's effort in raising four children and six grandchildren. ",
    "8ecaee865ca6e334956bd0ad1ece9daf045bed2aeaf1195df0391860": "An unidentified breed of jellyfish that has striking similarities to a deadly species has been sighted near a popular family beach. Scott Belcher spotted the 30 centimetre long jellyfish swimming 800 metres from the shore at Shelly Beach at Cronulla, south of Sydney, on Sunday. Its structure has stumped experts who have been left scratching their heads trying to determine if it's a new species or cross between several breeds. Mr Belcher believed the sea creature may have been a southern box jellyfish known as a Jimble.  The jellyfish have a body length of five centimetres, tentacles spanning 25cm and a sting likened to a 'cattle prod'. The unidentified species appears to be much larger with a body length of 10 centimetres and tentacle span of 20 to 30cm.  Fears were raised it could have potentially been a variation of the fatal northern box jellyfish scientifically labelled Chironex fleckeri. The species is considered to be the most venomous sea creature and has claimed the lives of 60 swimmers in Australia. The jellyfish enjoy swimming in warm coastal waters and are commonly found in the Indo-Pacific region and northern Australia. Their bodies can grow up to 38cm wide and their tentacles up to three metres.   Launceston biologist Dr Lisa-ann Gershwin reassured swimmers the unidentified creature was not a northern box jellyfish. She was not ready to rule it out as deadly and said it could be a cross between the Chironex fleckeri and Chiropsella saxoni. Dr Gershwin described the jellyfish as a 'mysterious critter' and said she was excited by the prospect of it being a new species.  'It actually looks like it might be venomous, but it may not be dangerous,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It definitely has venom, but whether it can kill two people is yet to be seen. That's the part we care about the most.' Dr Gershwin advised it was better for swimmers to keep their distance until it could be determined if the jellyfish was venomous. 'There are two ways of finding out if it's venomous: someone can get stung, or we can test it,' she said. 'We would much rather prefer to test it, rather than find out by accident.'  Dr Gershwin admitted she has not yet thought of a name for the jellyfish. 'The two questions I want to know is, who is it and how dangerous is it?' she said. 'It's amazing in this day and age with so many people in the water and go, 'oh my god, I don't know what this is'.' ",
    "db4132331854138ef63ed9e7864a7a882128898d5935c9be14fac78a": "Ex-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull is steadfastly refusing to say who he will vote for at the federal election and has appeared to encourage Australian voters to throw their support behind independents, rather than Liberal candidates. Mr Turnbull is poised speak at Washington's Harvard Club on Friday morning (AEST) where he's set to explain how support has risen for small-l liberal independent candidates due to their stance on issues like climate change. Scott Morrison's government is under threat from a wave of so-called 'teal-Independents', largely in wealthy, urban seats, which could result in the Coalition being removed from power.   In his speech, Mr Turnbull plans to say that voters could thwart the 'dominant' Liberal faction 'by voting for an independent who has a real chance of success', according to the Sydney Morning Herald. 'Since my deposition in 2018 it is fair to say that the liberal, or moderate, voices have been marginalised and their influence is much diminished and diminishing - especially on the toxically controversial issue of climate change where the political right, supported by Murdoch's media, have opposed effective action for many years.  'In many respects this may be the most interesting part of the whole election, because if more of these 'teal' independents win, it will mean the capture of the Liberal Party will be thwarted by direct, democratic action from voters.' In a later interview with ABC Radio, Mr Turnbull denied that he was encouraging voters to back independents. The former PM claimed he simply saying it is people's democratic right to make their own choices.   'I'm not encouraging people to vote for anyone, I'm encouraging people to vote.' Mr Turnbull in March said growing support for independents was a reaction to Liberals being seen as 'too right wing on most issues' such as climate change. The former PM has been highly critical of the Morrison Government - which he once led - and has kept tight-lipped about whether he will support the Liberal candidate in his seat of Wentworth, Dave Sharma. He refused to reveal who has his backing in the seat he held for 14 years until the 2018 by-election, adding either of the two lead candidates would do a good job. 'I'm staying out of the election contest,' Mr Turnbull said. 'My only contribution to the election in Wentworth will be to vote.' Current Liberal MP Dave Sharma faces a tough challenge to hold onto his seat from high profile independent Allegra Spender, 12 months after the tragic death of her mother, late fashion designer Carla Zampatti. Mr Turnbull denied he was trying to push voters in a certain way, saying the 'tide has really gone out for the smaller 'L' liberals and the moderates'. 'So the consequence is that people who were more comfortable with that side of the Liberal Party are, if you like, voting with their feet, and supporting 'teal independents',' he told the ABC.  'Now that is their democratic right, and whether you want to vote for them or not -- I'm not encouraging people to vote for anyone, I'm encouraging people to vote.'  Mr Turnbull was booted out of office in August 2018 after calling a leadership spill which eventually saw Scott Morrison sworn in as the next prime minister. Since then the former Liberal leader has become a vigorous climate change campaigner, regularly attacking the federal government over its energy and emissions policies.  When Mr Morrison scrapped a $90billion submarine deal with France, Mr Turnbull backed French President Emmanuel Macron who labelled him a liar. 'Oh, he's lied to me on many occasions,' Mr Turnbull said when asked about the spat between Mr Morrison and French President Emmanuel Macron at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. 'There's quite a few examples in my book, but he's -- Scott has always had a reputation for telling lies. Mr Morrison at the time maintained Mr Macron was not blindsided by the cancellation of the contract and texts prove he knew there were problems with the Naval Group project before Australia announced it was withdrawing from the deal. But Mr Turnbull, under whom the 2016 contract for the Attack Class vessels was signed, thinks Mr Morrison owes the French an apology. 'He did very elaborately and duplicitously deceive France,' Mr Turnbull told ABC radio on Tuesday. 'When you're dealing with people, honestly - and Scott Morrison did not do that - you don't drop hints. You actually tell the truth. 'It was a partnership between two nations, it was a cornerstone of France's Indo-Pacific strategy and to be double-dealing them the way Morrison did was shameful.'",

Peter Carter, who is mayor of Port Hedland in Western Australia, was in a Vietnam hotel when he joined the Microsoft Team meeting on March 31. Mr Carter also sits on the board at Hedland Senior High School and shared the video call with fellow members.   He said he had a 'really bad connection' during the brief 10-minute meeting and had absolutely no idea he was being watched on the other side of the screen.  One month later he was informed by principal Janine Keall that a complaint had been made against him. 'I didn't want to resign,' he told The West Australian.  'I wanted to come to the board meeting and apologise to people who saw ... because it was embarrassing.' Mr Carter did not clarify the identity of the woman in the video call. He said it was nobody's business 'if it was my wife, my girlfriend, fiancee'.  Mr Carter was elected local mayor in October 2020 and will remain in the position for the next four years. He has stood firm on his decision to remain in the role and said he did not have any intention to resign.  Department of Education director general Lisa Rodgers told Daily Mail Australia a complaint had been made against Mr Carter. 'A complaint was received by the board chair and principal about what appeared to be inappropriate conduct during an online board meeting,' she said. 'School board members are held to the highest standards of conduct and hold a position of trust as a voice that represents the community. 'What was seen did not appear on the screens of the board chair and principal. 'As soon as the complaint was received, the principal acted. The board member was asked to resign and did so.'",
    "c71440c7d7c5b4f42927247aa01baec3d4a86c6ce9ddd6a0594802a7": "An Australian mother has erupted after her home-delivered grocery bags contained a less than savoury item. Disgruntled Woolworths shopper, Emma Wietschorke, couldn't believe a 'jar of mould' had turned up in the place of the home-brand passata she had ordered online from the Woolworths Vincentia store on the New South Wales south coast. The jar of Woolworths Essential Chunky Tomato Pasta Sauce looks normal in the bottom of the bottle, but right by the neck of the bottle the jar is filled with a grey-green mould.  Ms Wietschorke hit out at the supermarket giant in a post on their Facebook page, outraged that pickers didn't see the pile of mould in the jar.  'Woolworths, you've done it again,' she wrote, 'First mouldy fruit now I've been sent a jar of mould masquerading as passata.' 'How your pickers missed this is beyond me.' The photos Ms Wietschorke shared with the post show the pasta sauce's foul colouring is hard to miss, though one commenter jumped to the defence of the Woolworths pickers. 'Agreed it shouldn't of (sic) been sent but it can be missed when the handful of shoppers are picking and packing up to 200+ orders a day,' the person wrote.  Woolworths responded to Ms Wietschorke and provided her the full $2.15 refund. The grocery giant conceded to Daily Mail Australia they sometimes slip up, but said they have since resolved the issue with the customer. 'We have a dedicated team of personal shoppers who work hard to handpick thousands of online orders to the highest standard every day. 'While our teams work hard to provide a great experience every time, we don't always get it right,' said Woolworths. A jar of unopened passata will normally store for between a year and a year and a half. Conventional food wisdom says any stored pasta sauce should be inspected upon opening for thickening, darkening and acidic notes in smell and flavour. Even scraping off mould or boiling a jar of pasta sauce that had traces of mould on top might not remove all the toxins as not all bacterial toxins are killed in the cooking process If a pasta sauce raises doubts, its best not to eat it. When in doubt, throw it out. An opened passata won't normally last more than 10 days in a fridge either. Source: Healthy Canning  ",
    "d01cdf4709314e6438e2d1974bd32362956de861a87aac81ec61f91b": " Dave Chappelle's attacker was slapped with four charges including battery and assault -  all misdemeanors - after LA's woke DA George Gascon announced he would not pursue felony charges.  On Thursday, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer charged 23-year-old Isiah Lee with battery, possession of a weapon with intent to assault, unauthorized access to the stage area during a performance, and commission of an act that delays the event or interferes with the performer after the embattled DA referred the case to the city attorney.  If convicted, Lee could face 18 months in county jail, but because of overcrowding and COVID he might never make an appearance behind bars because of Gascon's decision to not press charges.  Feuer's swift charges are a stark contrast to DA George Gascon's decision, who made the decision not to pursue felony charges against Lee - despite the fact that Lee had a fake gun complete with a folding knife on him when he rushed Chappelle on stage. When announcing the charges, Feuer seemed to throw shade at the DA, saying 'My office takes protecting public safety extremely seriously.'  Gascon's office - which is famously in favor of low-or-no-cash-bonds - decided he was not pursuing the most serious line of punishment and instead referred the case to Feuer, Gascon's office recommended a misdemeanor charge because 'the evidence as presented did not constitute felony conduct,' according to ABC. On Tuesday night, Lee ran on stage at the Hollywood Bowl yielding the knife that was hidden inside a gun. Chappelle, 48, was able to sidestep him and was unharmed. The attacker was then arrested at the scene, and taken to hospital with a broken arm.  There were immediate questions over security at the event and how the man could have smuggled in the weapon.  Chappelle has not yet reacted to the decision.  Yesterday, he said via a representative that he did not want the incident to 'overshadow' a great event.  'Dave Chappelle celebrated four nights of comedy and music, setting record-breaking sales for a comedian at the Hollywood Bowl....and he refuses to allow last night's incident to overshadow the magic of this historic moment.' 'As unfortunate and unsettling as the incident was, Chappelle went on with the show,' his rep said.  Netflix and the Hollywood Bowl said they were cooperating with the police investigation into what happened.  Gascon, a 67-year-old former assistant chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, took over as district attorney in the heavily Democrat city in December 2020 and immediately embarked on a progressive justice reform agenda. He has been vocal about his belief that the criminal justice system needs to focus more on intervention and rehabilitation, blasting 'tough on crime' policies as racist and a failure. And following his first 100 days in office, he touted the changes he has made to the city's justice system - including limiting the use of sentencing enhancements like the ones lobbied against Hernandez. The California penal code has more than 100 enhancements that could add time to a convict's sentence depending on the situation, most of which date back to when California was facing soaring crime in the 1980s and 1990s. But under Gascon's reign, the use of those enhancements have been greatly reduced, with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office 5,138 enhancements during his first three months - a 71 percent drop when compared to the same time the year before, when former District Attorney Jackie Lacey was in power, according to LAist. Under Lacey, prosecutors filed 715 gun enhancements between December 2019 and February 2020 under the state's '10-20-Life' law, which adds 10 years to a sentence if you use a gun during the commission of a robbery or any other crime. The law also adds 20 years if the suspect discharges the gun, and 25 years if they wound someone in the process. In Gascon's first three months in office, however, prosecutors filed only 106 gun enhancements - an 85 percent decrease.  ",
    "af599e05bb7514ca91c11c7799cd5ad70e5d4300c90c79226be67379": "Sen. Mitt Romney is predicting Trump will be the GOP's nominee in 2024 if he runs. The Utah Republican - who twice voted to impeach former President Donald Trump - made the statement following the victory by Trump-backed candidate J.D. Vance in the Ohio Republican primary for Senate. He will succeed Sen. Rob Portman, a more conventional establishment Republican who nevertheless immediately threw his support to Vance following his win Tuesday.   'I don't delude myself into thinking I have a big swath of the Republican Party,' said Romney, who was the party's presidential nominee in 2012 and was defeated by President Barack Obama.  'It's hard to imagine anything that would derail his support,' he said, in comments reported by Axios. 'So if he wants to become the nominee in '24, I think he's very likely to achieve that,' Romney said. 'He's the leader of the party, that's clear ... If he decides to run, he will be the nominee,' Romney said.  Romeny's comments are hardly out of the mainstream when it comes to political observers.  A ABC News / Washington Post poll this week found 60 per cent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents think Republican leaders should follow Trump, with just 34 per cent saying they should lead the party in a different direction. That comes in a survey where a 52 percent overall majority said Trump should be charged with crimes over January 6. There have been other demonstrations of Trump's power through his sway in primaries and in the way other leading Republicans have deferred to him.   Trump through his support to Vance in the three-way primary, and his son Donald Trump, Jr. campaigned with Vance. Trump-alligned tech investor Peter Thiel poured millions into the race. Vance repeatedly praised Trump after condemning him in the past, and took up his attacks on government officials he called 'corrupt.' Immediately after his win, Portman, who had backed rival Jane Timken, said he supported Vance's reelection.  Agreeing with Romney's take was Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who was photographed raising his fist to protesters outside the Capitol on Jan. 6th. 'He's the leader of the party, that's clear ... If he decides to run, he will be the nominee,' he said, Politico reported. Hawley is himself considered a potential candidate for president. Romney said last year he wouldn't vote for Trump if he is the GOP nominee.  But Senate Minority Leader said in February he would 'absolutely' support Trump if he is the nominee.  That came despite McConnell accusing Trump of 'disgraceful dereliction of duty' on Jan. 6. On Wednesday President Joe Biden called MAGA 'the most extreme political organization in American history,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would continue to make the case against it around the country in the coming weeks.",
    "6033ad72cc08b1fe92f03b0737012fef0629b6ef1b3d807e56d37aef": "New York City's top health official says mask mandates and vaccine checks could make a comeback as the city battles a slight uptick in cases and hospitalizations from the omicron BA.2 subvariant.  But one small business association says the return of pandemic restrictions would be a step 'backwards' that bars and restaurants 'cannot afford' as inflation and supply chain issues cut into their bottom lines. The city increased its COVID-19 alert from low to medium this week. Commissioner Ashwin Vasan - who previously sparked outrage when he said children under 5 will stay masked 'indefinitely' - has announced that restrictions will come back for all New Yorkers if things get worse. 'It's clear that if we moved into a high risk and high alert environment, we'd be seriously considering bringing those mandates back,' he told CNBC.  The city would go into high alert if 10 out of every 100,000 people are hospitalized with COVID, or if inpatient beds reached 10 percent occupancy across a seven-day average. Hospitalization rates are currently at seven out of 100,000, which is close to the high alert benchmark. Hospital occupancy, however, remains at a low 3.12 percent, though it's still increasing. As of today, 87 percent of adults and 78 percent of all New Yorkers are fully vaccinated.  A spokesman for the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene told DailyMail.com they're 'watching the data' but still recommend that New Yorkers wear a mask indoors - which is currently only required on public transportation, at health facilities or during Broadway shows. The return of stringent COVID restrictions would affect businesses like restaurants and movie theaters that just stopped checking customers' vaccine cards in March. Customers who have largely gotten used to baring their faces in public establishments again would also have to adjust to the sudden shift. The Broadway League, a trade association of theaters, producers and managers, told DailyMail.com they will follow any 'city, state and CDC guidelines' if new rules are put in place. But some New Yorkers may find the return of mandatory masking and vaccine checks difficult as the city slowly returns to normal.  Multiple studies have shown young children are not at serious risk from Covid-19. Data from from American Academy of Pediatrics shows children accounted for about 19 percent of all COVID cases, but less than 0.26% of cases resulted in death.   A study from October found that around half of pediatric Covid cases are asymptomatic, and that was before the more mild Omicron variant became dominant in the U.S.  Hospitalizations of pediatric COVID patients are also rare.  A study in February, found the Pfizer vaccine was only 12% effective at preventing Omicron in five- to 11- year-olds.  The main argument in favor of vaccinating children is to prevent them from spreading the virus but researchers from University of Berlin found, on average, children release less Covid particles into the air. Experts believe people who release lower amounts of aerosol particles when speaking have smaller viral loads, which also means they do not spread the virus at the same level.   The conservative National Federation of Independent Business called the potential return of restrictions a 'challenge.' 'Now, with rampant inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and increased labor costs, a contraction in economic activity would be devastating for the economy and our small entrepreneurs,' the association told DailyMail.com in a statement. 'New York's economy is just starting to rebound with a return to some normalcy. Now is not the time to go backwards.' Cases in the city are currently at 200 per 100,000 people - or two percent.  NYC Health spokesman Patrick Gallahue says the department is keeping an eye on rising cases and 'working to bring our alert level back to low.' 'At the moment that entails recommendations to New Yorkers to mask up in public indoor settings,' he said. Hospitalization rates are currently at seven out of 100,000 residents. At 10, the city would go into high alert. 'We would need to see those levels rise to concerning benchmarks in order for us to move into a higher risk category,' Commissioner Vasan told CNBC. 'I think the choices we make now are going to be determinative.' Vasan is a Harvard graduate who teaches clinical population and family health and medicine at Columbia University. The primary care doctor and epidemiologist became health commissioner in March.  Mayor Eric Adams lifted vaccine checks in early March. The mask mandate for students at public schools from K-12 have also ended, though toddlers are still required to wear masks as they're ineligible for vaccines as of yet. Infections and hospitalizations are down more than 90 percent from the peak of the Omicron wave in January but have been ticking upward because of the new subvariant. The seven-day average of cases in New York City was 1,589 on April 1. On May 1, it was 2,715.   Hospitalizations in the city have also gone up from a post-Omicron low of 20 on March 6 to 51 on Monday.  'Between the end of the omicron wave and the beginning of this current wave, we had maybe a month of relatively low transmission,' Vasan said. 'What I'd like to see is a prolonged period of low transmission.' Last month, Vasan sparked outrage after saying children younger than five will have to wear masks while in school for the foreseeable future.  'I think it's indefinite at this point,' Vasan said when asked about how long the policy would remain in place. 'People who have tried to predict what's going to happen in the future in this pandemic have repeatedly found egg on their face, as they say, and I'm not going to do that here today.' On April 4, about two dozen protesters were seen by the New York Daily News shouting death threats while outside Vasan's lavish brownstone property in Fort Greene, Brooklyn.    They shouted 'unmask our kids' while another flew a 'F**k Biden' banner.  The BA.2 variant is behind 61.9 percent of cases in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The BA.2.12.1 variant is responsible for 36.5 percent of nationwide cases. Both are subvariants of Omicron.  Luckily for Americans, and people around the world, the most recent version of the virus that has taken over the world is more mild than others. The Omicron variant, which rose to prominence in late 2021, causes hospitalization and death at much lower levels than its predecessor, the Delta variant. It is also highly infectious, and entirely snuffed out the more-dangerous Indian-borne strain. According to most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the variant makes up every single sequenced cases in the US.",
    "e07ededc0d14d570e2dfb2af17726f2eaa3b62fb0214eff4c2237fb7": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams split his crime-plagued town this week to hobnob with billionaires and comedians on the West Coast - as his approval rating nosedives - and was so late in returning to the Big Apple on Thursday that he had to cancel scheduled press events. Adams' two-day California adventure comes amid revelations that a member of the playboy mayor's entourage, Hollywood superagent Cade Hudson, was once accused of sexual harassment. On Wednesday, Adams, 61, participated in a panel at the Milken Institute Global Conference on 'digital transformation' before heading to the local Museum of Tolerance to celebrate Israel's independence day. He finished the night attending billionaire philanthropist Nicolas Berggruen gala at his Hearst Estate in Beverly Hills. The busy day followed Adams' stop to take in David Chappelle's show, where he witnessed 23-year-old Isiah Lee storm the stage with a gun that contained a hidden knife while the comedian joked that he'd had to increase his security in light of his trans jokes at the Netflix is a Joke festival.  Adams didn't arrive home until late Thursday because of what his press shop called a 'last-minute flight cancellation.' The cancellations forced the mayor to miss several events, including a rally demanding he be allowed to control the city's school system.  Adams' sojourn out West comes as crime continues to rise across the Big Apple despite his promises to crack down on the already surging numbers under predecessor Bill de Blasio.  Through May 1, overall crime is up 41 percent in New York City from the same period in 2021. While murders are down 14 percent, robberies are up 44 percent and felony assaults are up 19 percent.  A recent poll  found that 43% of New Yorkers approve of Adams' overall job since taking over in January -- down from the 46% in the same survey conducted in February.  Adams has been seen about town throughout his first months in Gracie Mansion.  Not only did he appear at the Met Gala on Monday, he was also seen with actress Cara Delevigne and rappers A$AP Rocky and Common at various city events.  Most recently, reports have seen him welcome Hollywood agent Cade Hudson into his inner circle.  Adams has spent many evenings with Hudson, a CAA agent who reps Britney Spears, Sean Penn and Emma Roberts among others, the Daily News reports.  He was accused of offering access to directors in exchange for sex to a male actor in 2013, according to the LA Times. Hudson was never sued or charged and has denied anything improper happened. Adams' reps told the Daily News Hudson is 'one of many people who know the mayor and have interacted with him.' Adams, 61, paid for the California trip out of campaign funds after attending the ritzy Met Gala in New York on Monday, according to staffers and spent two days in Southern California. He said Lee's actions were indicative of 'some of the mental health crises we're facing' and added that it was 'unbelievable.' 'Violence is unacceptable. Thank God there was a response to make sure that he wasn't injured seriously,' Adams said. 'It was horrific to have someone come on stage and attack in that manner.' Adams, however, said that Chappelle was back to his normal self 'just telling jokes' after the attack.   Chappelle was uninjured and carried on with the show.   Lee was then tackled by security guards who appeared to break his arm in the melee. He is described as weighing 140lbs and is 5ft 11.  Scroll down for video  Foxx replied: 'I thought that was part of the show, I didn't know what the f***...' Chappelle said: 'I grabbed the back of that n**** head. His hair was spongy. Absorbent.' Foxx added: 'Listen, I just want to say, this man is an absolute genius. We've got to make sure we protect him at all times. 'For every comedian who comes out here, this means everything. You're a genius. You're a legend, I enjoyed myself thoroughly, and we're not going to let nothing happen to you.' Chappelle said: 'I've been doing this for 35 years. I just stomped a n**** backstage. I've always wanted to do that.'",
    "dc1a3fbd6af7ad645c3bd53b105f69ac51f4c10329483bb3f4bca021": "A tradie who had sex with a drunk law student he met while on a night out has been found not guilty of raping the woman.  Phoenix Cooper, 23, of St Kilda East - 6km southeast of Melbourne's CBD - was on Friday cleared unanimously by a Supreme Court of Victoria jury in Melbourne - a little over a day after they retired to consider their verdict.  The woman had claimed Cooper had raped her after her uni mates convinced her she had been 'drug spiked' by him, the jury had heard.  A relieved Cooper thanked Justice John Champion before walking free to try and piece back together his shattered life.  The tradesman had maintained his innocence from the moment police called him in over the disastrous one-night stand.  The jury heard he had been introduced to the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, by her law student mate while on a trip to the bar at the Antique Bar in Elsternwick.  Cooper pleaded not guilty to a single charge of rape, claiming he had no idea the brief sexual dalliance he shared with the woman was anything but consensual.  The court heard the woman herself claimed to have no memory of the actual act after her memory became 'fuzzy' just after midnight on April 20, 2019.  But that didn't stop police charging Cooper, alleging the woman was either too drunk to give her consent or had been asleep during the act.   Crown prosecutor Brett Sonnet told the jury by the time the woman left the bar she had consumed wine and martinis off her own bat and accepted shots of cognac and whiskey from Cooper.  When forensic doctors tested her blood alcohol content at 7.55am that morning they estimated she would have recorded somewhere between .135 and a .204 - more than four times the legal limit to drive - when the alleged rape happened.  The court heard Cooper had wooed the woman with tales of his window glazing business, cash and time living in New York.  Later that night, Cooper and the woman left her friends to enjoy a cigar.  'He definitely has coke,' the woman's male uni mate texted as she stepped outside the bar to sit with Cooper.  Philip Dunn, QC, is recognised as one of Melbourne's top barristers.  He has walked the streets of Melbourne's court district for near on 50 years.  Back in the 1970s, Mr Dunn represented Norman Lee in the 1976 Great Bookie Robbery, which remains one of the largest Australian armed robberies.  In 1994, alongside Robert Richter QC - who would go onto defend Cardinal George Pell - he represented Detectives Lockwood and Avon, who were charged with the murder of Gary Abdallah following the Walsh Street police murders.  Both were aquitted.  The woman had been accused by the defendant's barrister - Melbourne silk Philip Dunn QC - of hoping to score drugs off Cooper the night she alleges he drugged and raped her.  The court heard the woman had engaged in a text conversation with her mate about Cooper's supposed access to cocaine - a conversation she also claims she can't remember having.  The woman denied any suggestion that she had hoped to get high with Cooper, whom she had only met that night.  The court heard her two friends became concerned when they discovered she had 'ditched' them at the club, leaving her purse and house keys, to go home with Cooper, whom her mate later described as 'some random'. The couple had been captured on CCTV leaving the Antique Bar just before 1am.  The friends arrived at Cooper's house later that night after he and their mate had already had sex.  In his closing address to the jury, Mr Dunn said the key issue in the trial was the belief of the complainant's friend that her drink had been spiked with drugs. '(He) becomes convinced that she must be drink-spiked, she must be drugged to be in the apartment with Mr Cooper. Drugged,' Mr Dunn said. Mr Dunn told the jury the woman had been surfing dating apps while enjoying pre-outing drinks at her home in the upmarket suburb of Brighton. He claimed his client was under the legitimate belief that he 'was about to get laid' when the woman climbed into bed with him and stripped off.  Moments earlier she had accidentally climbed into the bed of Cooper's born-again Christian housemate after a trip to the toilet.  The jury heard the woman recorded a 15 out of 15 on the Glascow Coma Scale - a clinical test used to reliably measure a person's level of consciousness after a brain injury - a little under an hour after the alleged rape.  '(She) thinks she's a victim and when she finds out in November that her drink hasn't been spiked, there aren't any drugs, she becomes active in contacting the police,' Mr Dunn said.  The jury heard the victim repeatedly contacted police asking them about the investigation.  'She's a victim. And she writes the note saying 'I want and need him charged'. She's making contact with the police, taking an active role in it,' Mr Dunn said.  'Why does she need him charged ... the defence suggests because she's now an entrenched victim.' Mr Dunn urged the jury to consider what his client must have thought after picking-up a woman at a bar, kissing her and winding up in bed with her.  'You're fond of this person, you're feeling affectionate towards him and the phone rings and the person says 'No, I'm not coming home, I'm going to stay here',' Mr Dunn said.  'What do you think? You think they want to stay with you, in a bedroom ... they start kissing, she takes her jeans off and then her panties, that it's a reasonable thing for him to think that she's up for sex?  'And anybody in his situation would think that ... anybody in his situation, as he said to the police, 'I'm going to get laid'. We say that's a pretty fair thing to think. And then she gets on top of him.' The jury agreed.  A jury heard the woman had not been keen to talk to her mates after she left the club with Phoenix Cooper.  When she didn't pick-up the phone, her uni mate managed to track Cooper's phone number down thanks to his previous bragging.  When he finally picked-up the phone some 20 minutes after leaving the bar, Cooper claimed she didn't want to speak.  Unconvinced, her law student friend - now in an Uber himself - continued to demand he speak with her.  'I'm fine, I'm fine,' the woman told him.  Concerned about the slurring of her speech, he asked and was provided Cooper's address so that he could come and check on her.  After that conversation, the woman got out of bed with Cooper and went to the toilet.  When she attempted to return to the bedroom, the jury heard she ended up in the bed of Cooper's born-again-Christian housemate, who promptly returned her to the correct bedroom.  At 1.20am, the woman's friends arrived at Cooper's apartment complex and called him again.  'Darling your friends are here,' Cooper was heard to say.  But when Cooper failed to bring the woman down within 10 minutes, her mates proceeded to wake-up the entire complex by pressing every doorbell.  When Cooper and the woman finally went downstairs, it was noted she had no shoes on and her clothes were on back-to-front.  He would later tell police he had never seen his friend in such a state in the eight years he'd known her.  He further claimed when all four of them went back up into Cooper's apartment to retrieve the shoes, she mouthed the words 'help me'.  The court heard the woman's two friends took her to hospital after she vomited in the Uber upon leaving Cooper's pad.  When cops met up with Cooper days later he freely admitted to having sex with the woman.   Cooper's barrister told the jury the reason his client hadn't opened the door for the woman's friends when they arrived that morning was because they were in the process of having sex, which Mr Cooper freely admitted when he finally opened the door.

The heartwarming snap features Nevaeh Austin sleeping in her hospital bed underneath a pink blanket, with her father Shane keeping watch of her.  The little girl was fighting for her life earlier this week after she was bizarrely left behind in a Gracemere, Queensland minibus, despite being the only passenger that morning.  Neveah's grandmother, Pamela Parker, on Friday morning appeared on morning television shows to inform the nation that the beloved toddler was 'awake, smiling, and eating ice-cream' showing signs of good health as she video-called her in the morning. Little Nevaeh Austin, 3, has made significant progress in the hours since she was rescued from her seat at the Le Smileys Early Learning Centre in Gracemere about 3pm on Wednesday. She woke up and started speaking on Thursday and her nana, Pamela Parker, told Sunrise on Friday morning: 'She's telling me she loves her nanny (and) brother and sister. 'She's calling out, squealing and laughing, poking her tongue out - she's doing awesome'.  The troubles for the family, however, are still not over yet as they still wait for answers as to why their precious girl had been locked in a nearly 30C minivan by two of her daycare workers for such a long time.   Baby Neveah had been rushed to Rockhampton Base Hospital in a critical condition after she was found in the van, she was then flown to Queensland Children's Hospital in Brisbane. Neveah was unresponsive when she was rescued from the locked vehicle outside the Le Smiles Early Learning Centre near Rockhampton. Temperatures soared to the nearly 30C on Wednesday afternoon in the area. Neveah is in a stable condition now, breathing on her own as her grandmother is set to join her at the Queensland Children's Hospital on Friday afternoon.  The family are demanding answers as to how a little girl came to be left inside a boiling minibus for six hours. The police investigation continued at the childcare centre on Thursday night with a particular focus on the internal temperature of the van.  Police worked late to examine the van, which has been forensically tested but not yet removed from the day care centre. A child's booster seat was visible as officers took pictures from multiple angles, jotted down notes and discussed their findings among one another. A temperature recording camera appeared to be placed in the locked van at one stage. It's understood police hoped to gauge an estimate of how hot it may have been inside the van for the six hours Nevaeh was trapped inside. Temperatures peaked at 30C in Rockhampton on Thursday - just one degree warmer than it was on Wednesday. Estimates suggest the interior of a car could have reached 56C after just 2 hours in direct sunlight. As the sun set, police continued to photograph the interior and exterior of the van using a high technology 3D laser scanner to exactly replicate the conditions met by the driver, her colleague and Nevaeh on Wednesday. They paid particular attention to the glass windows on the driver's side of the van. A sign out the front of the school boasts of having a pick-up and drop-off service, which centre owner Michelle O'Rourke revealed on Thursday would be permanently suspended in the wake of this latest tragedy. Just steps away from where the van was parked there are more signs warning of the dangers of leaving children in hot cars. 'Never leave children alone in a car,' one sign reads. 'Four-and-a-half minutes inside of a car could be as high as 70 degrees.' The warning also outlines health risks, including heat stress, dehydration, brain injury, serious kidney damage, and death. 'Always check your back seat is free of passengers before leaving your car,' the sign reads. Meanwhile inside the centre, three plain clothes detectives were sifting through administrative documents and photographing the area behind the reception desk. Police tape blocks both the entrance to and the exit from Le Smileys and investigations are expected to continue for at least the next few days.  Ms O'Rourke sent an email to families on Thursday morning to inform them that school would be closed until at least the end of the week. She was the only child in the van on the day in question. Her family are now demanding answers as to how she was forgotten by staff and left alone for six hours without anyone noticing she was missing. Traumatised grandmother Pamela Parker arrived at the local police station on Thursday afternoon and told waiting media her family would not stop until they got answers. Fighting back tears, Ms Parker said she's feeling 'lost, hurt and angry'. 'I'm worried for my daughter. I'm worried for her mental health and how this is going to affect Nevaeh, at the end of the day and what this is going to do to her mental health.' Ms Parker hopes the youngster won't remember the ordeal, 'but at the end of the day, we don't know,' she added.  Nevaeh is still in hospital and very tired, but she's back to her 'happy self', family say. 'I'm thankful my granddaughter has pulled through but what this must be doing to her, I can't even imagine,' she said. Earlier on Thursday, the youngster's aunt, Christy Atta-Singh, opened up about her heartache. 'Thank you to everyone that has messaged, called or offered help at this horrendous time. It's a disheartening time for all involved,' she wrote on Facebook. 'Vaeh has Austin in her blood so is fighting her little heart out, and has been raised by a tough woman.' 'It's gut wrenching seeing and being bedside to such an innocent child.' Ms Atta-Singh said her niece is 'in the best hands' and has 'all the love and support in the world'. ",
    "4eb6419745ac6944a4a12a5986df91874ed0c4fb62bd07bb609ddece": "Jen Psaki admitted she was struggling to fight back tears as she introduced her 'partner in truth' Karine Jean-Pierre as President Joe Biden's new press secretary. Psaki will be stepping down on May 13 and it is reported she will be joining left-wing television network MSNBC, though she never confirmed the new gig when asked about it in the past.  'I'm going to cry', an emotional Psaki said at the start of her briefing on Thursday as she brought her successor up to the podium and hugged her.  'I just want to take the opportunity to celebrate and congratulate my friend, my colleague, my partner in truth Karine Jean-Pierre, the next White House Press Secretary,' Psaki said. Fox News' Peter Doocy then said he will miss his favorite sparring partner Psaki in the briefing room. She dryly responded by saying: 'Will you?' She refused to comment on her future amid speculation she will likely head to MSNBC, and said she is only looking forward to 'sleeping' and 'reading books'. She then asked reporters for Netflix suggestions.   Jean-Pierre, 44, will be the first black female White House press secretary and first openly LGBTQ+ person in the role, Psaki said in a tweet celebrating her successor.  'Karine not only brings the experience, talent and integrity needed for this difficult job, but she will continue to lead the way in communicating about the work of the Biden-Harris Administration on behalf of the American people,' Biden said in a statement. Biden said he and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden 'have known and respected Karine a long time and she will be a strong voice speaking for me and this Administration.' He went on to praise Psaki' for 'returning decency' to the White House briefing room in what appears to be a veiled jab at the Trump administration's more combative relationship with the press.  'Jen Psaki has set the standard for returning decency, respect and decorum to the White House Briefing Room,' Biden said. 'I want to say thank you to Jen for raising the bar, communicating directly and truthfully to the American people, and keeping her sense of humor while doing so.' 'I thank Jen her service to the country, and wish her the very best as she moves forward.' The Columbia University grad was born in Martinique, and served as chief of staff to now-Vice President Kamala Harris on the Biden campaign.  Jean-Pierre also worked in the Obama administration as Regional Political Director for the White House Office of Political Affairs, and on both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns.  Before joining Biden's presidential bid she was an MSNBC and NBC political analyst and held roles at MoveON.org and the American Civil Liberties Union.  The veteran communications officer lives with her partner, CNN journalist Suzanne Malveaux, and their child.  Psaki lauded Jean-Pierre's historic appointment in a statement on Twitter.  'She will be the first black woman and the first openly LGBTQ+ person to serve as the White House Press Secretary. Representation matters and she will give a voice to many, but also make many dream big about what is truly possible,' the outgoing press secretary said.  Psaki said Jean-Pierre has 'decades of experience from her early years working in government and politics in NYC, to her years as an outspoken advocate, to serving as a long-time advisor to [Biden] back when he was the VP.' 'She is passionate. She is smart and she has a moral core that makes her not just a great colleague, but an amazing Mom and human. Plus, she has a great sense of humor,' Psaki praised.  Jean-Pierre, 44, who serves as Psaki's deputy, has stepped in to fill the press secretary's shoes on multiple occasions, including during both of Psaki's Covid situations. She is well-accustomed to the press, having briefed repeatedly on presidential trips and having taken turns at the podium herself without incident or veering off script. She is known for keeping a close grip on the binder of information compiled for briefers, and takes pains not to get far from its contents. That is what she did when she jumped on President Biden's trip to Europe last month on short notice following Psaki's positive covid test.  She briefed reporters aboard Air Force One en route, but kept a low profile on the trip during Biden's rounds of diplomacy.   Jean-Pierre has stepped in for Psaki at the podium multiple times in the first part of Biden's administration - perhaps most notably when the press secretary was out after testing positive for COVID-19.  Along with her new promotion, the White House also announced Thursday that former senior Biden adviser Anita Dunn would be returning to the administration in the same role.  Dunn left the White House in August 2021. She is also an Obama veteran, having served in the role of acting communications director in the former president's administration in 2009. Psaki, for her own part, has kept mum over her future job prospects - presumably for ethical reasons.  When asked about potential ethical concerns about her reportedly joining MSNBC while still at the podium, Psaki said during an April 1 briefing that she has 'abided' by any and all ethics guidelines without confirming the report.   'Well, there are a range of stringent ethical and legal requirements that are imposed on everybody in this administration and many administrations past about any conversations you're having with future employers,' she deflected at the time. 'That is true of any industry you're working in. And I have abided by those, and tried to take steps to go beyond that as well.'  She added, fresh off a stint of isolation due to COVID: 'I have nothing to confirm about my length of public service or planned service, or anything about consideration about next plans. I'm very happy to be standing with all of you here today after it felt like a never ending endless time in my basement quarantining away from my family.'  Other names that were potentially floated to replace Psaki are Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby, State Department spokesman Ned Price and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield.",
    "249dcb046cd15d3c5aa18f387822197a0ed8f57a80bf166cd4057815": "Elon Musk's mother bashed a New York Times' article which said her son had 'white privilege' in apartheid-era South Africa and was 'detached from apartheid's atrocities'. Maye Musk condemned the article, published on Thursday, that said her son was sheltered from the segregation and anti-black government propaganda that plagued South Africa throughout his childhood until he left at age 17.  In promoting the article on Twitter, the Times wrote: 'Elon Musk grew up in elite white communities in South Africa, detached from apartheid's atrocities and surrounded by anti-Black propaganda.  'He sees his takeover of Twitter as a free speech win but in his youth did not suffer the effects of misinformation,' The Times added, referencing Musk's $44 billion takeover of the social media platform.  Maye snapped back at the paper on Twitter, writing: 'In South Africa, if you publicly opposed apartheid, you went to jail. In Russia, if you publicly oppose the war, you go to jail. @nytimes, are you going to blame children for decisions made by governments?'  In the article, the Times interviewed relatives and classmates of the Tesla CEO and richest man in the world, revealing that the communities Musk grew up in, Johannesburg, Pretoria and Durban, were all shrouded in misinformation that influenced its residents.  'We were really clueless as white South African teenagers. Really clueless,' Melanie Cheary, a classmate of Mr. Musk's at Bryanston High School, told the Times.   While the article claimed that the cities fell victim to the government's propaganda campaign, with newspapers arriving to readers with whole sections blacked-out, it ultimately suggested that the censorship seen in South Africa may have influenced Musk's intense defense of free speech as he's repeatedly voiced his opposition to how Twitter bans individuals.  Others also took to Twitter to slam the Times' article, claiming it was ridiculous to suggest Musk could have done anything to stop apartheid as a child.  One Twitter user with the handle Ataxerex2020 wrote, 'I'm certain @elonmusk was aware of the horrors of apartheid, it does not mean he approved of it as the article subtly implies.'  Another Twitter user mocked the story, suggesting a different headline: 'Why did Elon Musk not single-handedly abolish apartheid at age 3?' Twitter user Geoffrey Miller expressed his frustration at the Times, writing: 'This is one of the most unethically cringe & toxically stupid smears the @nytimes has ever published. Shame on you, you sociopathic ghouls.'  Tim Young, another Twitter user, wrote: 'The New York Times: 'Elon Musk didn't end apartheid in South Africa as a child, therefore he is evil now.'' Although the article goes into detail on how apartheid-era propaganda influenced white residents and clouded the horrors of the conflict, it repeatedly mentions Musk's criticisms of apartheid and his close relationships with black classmates and family friends.  Errol Musk, the billionaire's estranged father who belonged to the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, told the Times that Musk and his siblings were fully aware of the horrors of apartheid from an early age and knew they had to be careful when visiting non-white friends.  'As far as being sheltered from it, that's nonsense' Errol said. 'They were confronted by it every day. They didn't like it.'  Elon was born in South Africa and left the country after graduating high school at 17, where he moved to Canada.   The look into what may have influenced Musk's policies over censorship comes as he is poised to become the new CEO of Twitter when his $44 billion acquisition goes through.  The tech tycoon will hold the role for a few months following the buyout, CNBC reported on Thursday morning. Specific details on the jobs, including how long it will last, were not immediately available and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The move could spark chaos at the social media giant, where Parag Agrawal has only been CEO for a few months. It comes after it was revealed that Musk has 18 investors committed to collectively stump up more than $7 billion worth of equity to help fund his takeover. In a filing on Thursday, Musk said his friend the Oracle Corp co-founder Larry Ellison's trust will invest $1 billion towards the $44 billion buyout. Musk said he had also received equity commitment letters from investors including Sequoia Capital ($800m) and Brookfield ($250m) for financing of $7.14 billion. Other investors listed included Qatari Holding ($375m) and NYC real estate investor Steve Witkoff ($100m). The filing also listed Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud as having committed 34,948,975 Twitter Inc shares. The royal made the move 'in order to retain an equity investment in Twitter following completion of the Merger'. Alwaleed had initially opposed the buyout but tweeted at Musk today referring to his 'new friend' who will be an 'excellent leader' at the social media giant. The tech tycoon has agreed to purchase Twitter for $54.20 per share, a 38 percent premium over the closing price on April 1 which was the last trading day before he disclosed his approximately 9 percent stake in the platform. The deal, however, is currently under review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for potential antitrust concerns.  The FTC now has 30 days to consider the deal and decide whether to issue a second request to probe the matter further, although most experts believe there are no antitrust concerns that could block the takeover, according to Bloomberg. However, the anti-monopoly activist group Open Markets Initiative, where Democratic FTC Chair Lina Khan used to work, has urged the agency to block the deal, saying that it 'poses immediate and direct threats to American democracy and free speech.' The group argued that Musk's ownership of the Starlink satellite internet service already gives him control over a key communication platform, and that his purchase of Twitter would be a dangerous concentration of power. Representative Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, on Wednesday issued a letter raising concerns about the FTC antitrust probe and suggesting he planned to investigate. Jordan expressed concern about statements by the Open Markets Institute (OMI), which he called 'an extreme left-wing political advocacy organization,' and its call for the FTC to stop the deal. Jordan has backed Musk's purchase of Twitter in hopes that some conservatives, like former President Donald Trump, who were removed from the social media platform would be able to return. There is little expectation that Musk's potential purchase of Twitter will be rejected by antitrust enforcers.",
    "378698c3ce984667b83f58ec054f65351bd728145349bdeaa4d16dbf": "Former President Donald Trump dumped on his former VP Mike Pence's political prospects in a new interview - where he said the conservative base 'loves me' and reiterated he was 'disappointed' in his former partner.    'Honestly, I haven't spoken to Mike in a long time,' Trump told the Christian Broadcasting Network.   'A long time is four or five months. I haven't spoken to him in a long time. And he's a nice man. He disappointed me on one thing because I think he should have sent the votes back to the legislatures,' Trump said.  It was an obvious reference to Pence's refusal to meet Trump's demand that he refuse to count votes certified by states for Biden on January 6, 2020. Trump tweeted that day that Pence lacked 'courage,' although the House Jan. 6 committee is investigating Trump's election overturn effort. Trump, who holds high approval ratings within the Republican Party and who scored a victory when his favorite candidate J.D. Vance prevailed in the Ohio Senate primary, handicapped Pence poorly in a contested presidential primary. 'So if Mike Pence gets into the 2024 presidential race, does the former president think his former VP has a shot?,' CBN interviewer David Brody asked. 'I don't want to say,' Trump responded.  'If Mike got in, I think it'd be a hard one for him. I think it would be a hard one.' Then Trump immediately turned to his own political attributes. 'I understand where the base is. I love the base. The base loves me. I think it'd be hard, but Mike was a good guy. I thought he was a very good vice president. He was my friend,' he said. Pence has spent years cultivating Christian conservative support. The former talk radio broadcaster carved out a voting record on conservative social issues as a House leader and member of the House GOP Caucus for a dozen years. He frequently calls himself 'a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.' Pence got a standing ovation at the Faith & Freedom Coalition meeting in Orlando last year, but a small group jeered at him, calling him a 'traitor.'  Trump's analysis appeared to presume a theoretical race that included both himself and Pence. But he also said he'll decide whether to make another run for the White House after the midterms. Many Republicans will likely wait until then to make their own decisions. Trump's camp has also been eyeing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as a potential rival. It went public early this year when Trump took a swing at DeSantis for failing to state publicly whether he had gotten a booster shot.  Sen. Mitt Romney is predicting Trump will be the GOP's nominee in 2024 if he runs.  'I don't delude myself into thinking I have a big swath of the Republican Party,' said Romney, who was the party's presidential nominee in 2012 and was defeated by President Barack Obama.  'It's hard to imagine anything that would derail his support,' he said, in comments reported by Axios. 'So if he wants to become the nominee in '24, I think he's very likely to achieve that,' Romney said. 'He's the leader of the party, that's clear ... If he decides to run, he will be the nominee,' Romney said. ",
    "9a6b46704cc0a6942ba3390fbf4b111cc4bd157d04788df3ed56d784": "LA's woke DA George Gascon will not pursue felony charges against the attacker who stormed Dave Chappelle's Hollywood Bowl concert with a bayonet, reducing the charges to misdemeanor instead.  Isaiah Lee, 23, ran on stage at the show on Wednesday yielding the knife that was hidden inside a gun.  Chappelle, 48, was able to sidestep him and was unharmed. The attacker was then arrested at the scene, and taken to hospital with a broken arm.  There were immediate questions over security at the event and how the man could have smuggled in the weapon.  But Gascon's office - which is famously in favor of low-or-no-cash-bonds - is not pursuing the most serious line of punishment.  Instead, they have referred the case to the LA City Attorney Mike Feuer,  recommending a misdemeanor charge because 'the evidence as presented did not constitute felony conduct,' according to ABC. It means Lee, who is currently being held on a $30,000 bond for felony assault with a deadly weapon, may soon walk free. It's unclear when he is next due in court.  Chappelle has not yet reacted to the decision.  Yesterday, he said via a representative that he did not want the incident to 'overshadow' a great event.  'Dave Chappelle celebrated four nights of comedy and music, setting record-breaking sales for a comedian at the Hollywood Bowl....and he refuses to allow last night's incident to overshadow the magic of this historic moment.' 'As unfortunate and unsettling as the incident was, Chappelle went on with the show,' his rep said.  Netflix and the Hollywood Bowl said they were cooperating with the police investigation into what happened.  Gascon is so famously soft on crime that convicted murderers have heralded him as a hero.  Luis Angel Hernandez, who is currently serving time for shooting and killing a delivery person for a marijuana delivery service during an armed robbery in 2018, had faced sentencing enhancements which would have added to his prison sentence. But when Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon took office in 2020, he implemented a directive barring prosecutors from applying these enhancements in nearly all cases, no matter the circumstances - and all of the sentencing enhancements lobbied against Hernandez were dropped. In a leaked phone call from prison exclusively obtained by FOX News, Hernandez praised Gascon for the change, saying: 'I'm going to get that n*****'s name on my face. That's a champ right there. 'F****** Gascon,' Hernandez could be heard saying in the audio, which was featured in a Tucker Carlson series about the rising crime in the City of Angels. 'That's the n***** right there, bro. He's making historic changes for all of us, bro.' In another case,  a transgender woman convicted of sexually assaulting a child in a Denny's was caught on audio gloating about her soft punishment.   Hannah Tubbs, who was born James Tubbs, was a minor at the time, and under Gascon's policy of never transferring minors to adult court, Tubbs received a two-year sentence - and was placed in a juvenile facility for women.  And in another leaked video obtained by FOX, convicted murderer Phillip Dorsett was seen drinking prison moonshine and toasting the woke district attorney. 'Right here with my cellie. Some white lightning, a little cup, boom. Celebrating us going home on this Gascon directive. Whoop.' Gascon, a 67-year-old former assistant chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, took over as district attorney in the heavily Democrat city in December 2020 and immediately embarked on a progressive justice reform agenda. He has been vocal about his belief that the criminal justice system needs to focus more on intervention and rehabilitation, blasting 'tough on crime' policies as racist and a failure. And following his first 100 days in office, he touted the changes he has made to the city's justice system - including limiting the use of sentencing enhancements like the ones lobbied against Hernandez. The California penal code has more than 100 enhancements that could add time to a convict's sentence depending on the situation, most of which date back to when California was facing soaring crime in the 1980s and 1990s. But under Gascon's reign, the use of those enhancements have been greatly reduced, with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office 5,138 enhancements during his first three months - a 71 percent drop when compared to the same time the year before, when former District Attorney Jackie Lacey was in power, according to LAist. Under Lacey, prosecutors filed 715 gun enhancements between December 2019 and February 2020 under the state's '10-20-Life' law, which adds 10 years to a sentence if you use a gun during the commission of a robbery or any other crime. The law also adds 20 years if the suspect discharges the gun, and 25 years if they wound someone in the process. In Gascon's first three months in office, however, prosecutors filed only 106 gun enhancements - an 85 percent decrease.  ",
    "d367988f56b8e99a0bc8d7261bb417da45572466b2a4eccbcb491718": "The top lawyer in former President Barack Obama's Department of Education warned in a 'strictly confidential' memo that President Joe Biden would be on shaky legal ground if he tried to cancel student debt using executive action.  On Wednesday night, The Wall Street Journal reported on the existence of the memo, penned by former Education Department lawyer Charlie Rose for his law firm Hogan Marren Babbo & Rose, Ltd. and dated May 7, 2021.  'If the issue is litigated, the more persuasive analyses tend to support the conclusion that the Executive Branch likely does not have the unilateral authority to engage in mass student debt cancellation,' Rose wrote.  He suggested that loan-servicing companies and investors that owned securities backed by federal student loans might be able to sue the administration if Biden broadly wiped out student debt.  The memo doesn't identify the client it was prepared for, though it contains recommendations for the Biden administration.  Rose told The Journal that the memo was prepared for a private client.  He also told the paper that he never intended it to be made public.  White House press secretary Jen Psaki has indicated that Biden plans to take some action on student loans before the replayment moratorium lifts on August 31.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and some prominent progressives, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have encouraged Biden to kill off $50,000 in debt per borrower using the stroke of his pen.  During the 2020 campaign, Biden floated $10,000 per borrower - and tied it to incomes under $125,000 a year, an income ceiling that Psaki said this week was still on the table.  Since becoming president, Psaki has also encouraged Congress to send Biden a bill writing off $10,000 in debt for every borrower.  On Capitol Hill, however, there aren't the votes to get a student debt relief bill passed through both chambers.  White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said last April that the White House had requested a legal review into what Biden could do via executive action.  Rose's memo cites that review in its introduction, however it's unclear whether the memo was circulated at the White House.  The White House declined to comment to The Journal on the matter.  A spokesperson for the Department of Education didn't respond directly to the paper's inquiry on Rose's legal argument, instead saying that the Biden administration's 'overall goal is long-lasting change that reduces indebtedness and makes college more affordable, including through rulemaking.'  The spokesperson added that the 'Department's review of broad based debt cancellation remains ongoing.'    Whether broad debt cancellation would be allowed depends on how courts interpret the Education Secretary's powers under the 1965 Higher Education Act, which gives the secretary 'consent' to modify loans and the power to 'compromise, waive or release' unspecified amounts of student debt.  Where Rose's memo preaches caution is that he says while Congress has created debt-forgiveness programs for targeted groups of borrowers 'it is fair to discern Congress has inferred that the [Education] Department should not decide the question of mass forgiveness of performing loans.'   Rose argues that for better legal cover, the administration can provide relief through a number of rules changes that would lead to forgiveness for large numbers of borrowers.  That avenue would take longer, Rose wrote, but would be less susceptible to lawsuits. ",
    "bbe72e076ecf7ebb2092c8224e94d4e2ca1cbdccf99e3a4c5b757423": "You probably won't be aware that if you take the wheel of a Volkswagen, BMW or Porsche, arrange an insurance policy with Allianz or even take a bite of a Dr Oetker frozen pizza or Bahlsen Choco Leibniz biscuit, you are directly linked to a company that grew fat on Nazi corruption and cruelty.  The owners of the companies that make them were part of a group of industrialists shoring up Adolf Hitler's regime.  In February 1933, just after he was appointed chancellor, Hitler called a secret meeting of Germany's most powerful industrialists, requesting they stump up three million reichsmarks for his party's election campaign.  The two dozen businessmen present didn't hesitate to get out their cheque books. Many would become key supporters of the Third Reich -- not just patriotic Germans but committed members of the Nazi Party and even the SS.  They decorated their mansions with paintings stolen from rich Jews sent to the concentration camps. Inmates from those camps would be worked to death in their factories.  The conventional narrative is that they weren't actually Nazis themselves, but merely doing their duty as Germans.  It's also generally accepted that, along with the rest of the country, they have atoned for their part in one of history's darkest chapters. Shockingly, neither assumption -- a new book reveals -- is true.  Some of Germany's richest families today remain beneficiaries of monstrous Nazi collaborators who were never punished and whose horrifying legacy continues to be kept quiet.  The full extent of this terrible and lingering stain on German corporate history is exposed in Nazi Billionaires -- The Dark History Of Germany's Wealthiest Dynasties.  Its author, Dutch financial journalist David de Jong, focuses on a clutch of the worst offenders, five dynasties whose products are still famous all over the world: the Quandts of BMW; the Flicks who once controlled Daimler-Benz (now Mercedes-Benz); the Porsche-Piech family who control car giant Volkswagen; the von Fincks, financiers who co-founded Allianz, the world's biggest insurance company; and the Oetkers, whose business empire stretches from Dr Oetker frozen pizza and cake ingredients to luxury hotels such as London's Lanesborough.  The man who ran the Oetker empire during World War II was an officer in the Waffen SS who trained at Dachau concentration camp and kept Nazi forces supplied with instant pudding. You won't find that on the label of a jar of Dr Oetker's Fairy Sprinkles.  De Jong writes: 'Their names adorn buildings, foundations and prizes. In a country that is so often praised for its culture of remembrance and contrition, an honest, transparent acknowledgment of the wartime activities of some of Germany's richest families remains, at best, an afterthought.'  Britain, the U.S. and France deserve some of the blame, he says. For the sake of 'political expediency' and to counter the 'looming threat of communism', the victorious Allies handed most of the tycoons back to Germany, which allowed the majority of them to walk free.  Even the handful who spent a few years in prison were soon back running their businesses. Ferdinand Porsche is remembered as the designer of the iconic Volkswagen Beetle and the name on some of the finest sports cars.  Until it was revealed in a TV documentary in 2019, the company he founded kept quiet about the fact that he'd had a Jewish partner and co-founder, racing driver Adolf Rosenberger. The omission wasn't hard to understand.  Rosenberger had left the company in 1935, forced to sell his stake for a fraction of its true value to Porsche and co-founder Anton Piech, under a ruthless Nazi policy known as 'Aryanisation', designed to stop Jews from owning businesses.  When Rosenberger was carted off to a concentration camp, Porsche did nothing to get him released although, thankfully, another senior company executive did and he fled penniless to the U.S.   After World War II, the company refused to compensate him, contesting his claim in court. (Porsche also refused to lift a finger for another Jewish colleague who asked for his help but ended up perishing in the Bergen-Belsen death camp).  Ferdinand Porsche became Hitler's favourite engineer and joined the Nazi Party. His company switched from making civilian cars to designing weapons and tanks. They used some 20,000 forced or slave labour workers -- either brought in from occupied countries or concentration camps. Most were women, including mothers who had to leave their children in a nursery where conditions, said a British prosecutor, 'defied belief'.  The Porsche family and their cousins the Piechs also used these miserable workers as their household servants.  Ferdinand's son and successor, Ferry Porsche, became an SS officer (later falsely claiming he had been forced to join by Himmler) and, after the war, instituted a policy of actively recruiting fellow former SS officers to the company.  One became its global PR chief, while another -- an SS tank commander who had massacred 84 U.S. PoWs in the notorious Malmedy Massacre -- was made head of sales promotion.  In a 1976 memoir, Ferry made anti-Semitic remarks about Rosenberger.  The Porsche and Piech families are now together worth $20billion (PS16 billion) and control the Volkswagen Group, which includes Bentley, Audi, Lamborghini, Seat and Skoda.  They have never publicly addressed their forebears' activities under the Nazis which -- given the intense pressure on companies and individuals in the UK and U.S. to apologise for far older and more tenuous historical sins -- is an astonishing state of affairs.  Instead, in 2018 they created the Ferry Porsche Foundation to reinforce the company's commitment to social responsibility.  Under public pressure, it funded a study by Stuttgart University into the company's Nazi period which, suspiciously, downplayed its mistreatment of Rosenberger. De Jong dismissed the study as a 'partial whitewash'.  Even now, the Ferry Porsche Foundation website pointedly contains no biography of the SS man after whom it is named.  Then there are the Quandts, even richer than the Porsches thanks to a controlling stake in BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce, as well as substantial chemical and technology interests.  Two of the heirs, Stefan Quandt and Susanne Klatten, until recently were Germany's richest family and have near majority (47 per cent) control of BMW. (Another branch of the family is worth a further $18 billion (PS14.5billion).  The siblings are grandchildren of industrialist Gunther Quandt whose second wife, Magda, was a Nazi 'groupie' who caught Hitler's eye but later married Hitler's chief propagandist Joseph Goebbels.  Both Gunther and his elder son Herbert were Nazi Party members and far more enthusiastic about its abhorrent politics than they ever admitted, says de Jong.  Gunther was quick to oust Jews from his companies' boards as soon as the Nazis' introduced anti-Semitic policies. Quandt also 'viciously' exploited the regime's Aryanisation policy, acquiring various Jewish-owned companies and others seized by the Germans in occupied countries for knockdown prices.  Like the Porsche-Piechs, the family made heavy use of Nazi slave labour -- some 57,000 laboured under appalling conditions in their factories.  The Quandts even built their own small concentration camp on site so they could house more workers.  Conditions for the workers were terrible. In the lead department of Gunther's submarine battery factory at Hanover, they were given no protection from the metal's poisonous fumes.  Some had accidents with boiling hot lead and had to have limbs amputated, others got their limbs trapped in machinery.  After the end of the war, both Gunther and Herbert were forced to undergo 'de-Nazification' -- an often ineffectual cultural detoxification process -- but were soon back running their businesses.  German historians prefer to remember Herbert not for building concentration camps but for 'saving' BMW from bankruptcy in 1960 when he bought the struggling company with a fortune inherited from his father.  The family haven't been able to brush it all under the rug as a 2007 German TV documentary unhelpfully revealed the family's little known Nazi connections and use of slave labour. Five days later, the Quandts commissioned their own investigation by a historian.  The latter took four years to publish a report confirming the allegations but even then the family kept Gunther's name on their HQ building outside Frankfurt.  Meanwhile, Stefan Quandt, who insists his father was never a 'convinced' Nazi, still awards an annual journalism prize named after Herbert.  It was only last October that the prize's website was finally amended to mention his Nazi era activities but still leaves out that he built a concentration camp, snapped up Jewish businesses and used PoWs as virtual slaves on his private estate.  BMW's charity arm is actually called the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt and, likewise, its official website makes no mention of any connection with the Third Reich.  A spokesman for the Quandt family has said the family had been transparent about its Nazi past. The same dogged reluctance to come clean can be found on the website of another of Germany's most influential charities -- the Friedrich Flick Foundation.  Named after the industrialist who for decades controlled Daimler-Benz, Germany's second biggest car maker (before selling it in 1985 to Deutsche Bank) the website somehow forgets to mention that he was a convicted Nazi war criminal.  Friedrich Flick was one of the key industrialists of the Third Reich and one of its biggest arms suppliers.  He also contributed generously to the funds of Hitler's murderous SS. In return, he made a fortune buying Jewish companies dirt cheap and was able to use 48,000 forced labourers in his coal mines, steel mills and munitions factories. It has been estimated that 80 per cent of them died.  Flick was convicted of war crimes in 1947 but served just two and a half years in prison. He was able to rebuild his business empire and became Germany's richest man.  The billionaire refused to pay a pfennig in compensation to the victims, and nor did his son and heir Friedrich Karl, whose six homes included a villa on the Cote d'Azur, penthouse in New York and a castle near Paris. The family remained tone deaf to Friedrich's crimes.  In 1992, GertRudolf 'Muck' Flick, his grandson, tried to create a professorship under the Flick name at Balliol College, Oxford, but only withdrew it after a public outcry.  Banker August von Finck inherited controlling stakes in the Allianz and Munich Reinsurance companies and private bank Merck Finck.  He gave millions to the Nazis in the 1930s, raising 20 million reichsmarks for Hitler's art gallery, the Haus der Deutschen Kunst, which was built to show off Nazi-approved Aryan art and architecture rather than 'degenerate' Jewish or abstract art.  Von Finck was handsomely rewarded when he was allowed to get his hands on Austria's largest bank, which belonged to the Jewish Rothschild family.  Von Finck would later claim he used his top level Nazi contacts to secure Louis von Rothschild from Gestapo custody when, in fact, says de Jong, two of the Jewish banker's siblings paid $21 million ($385 million today) -- the largest known ransom paid in modern history.  Von Finck never renounced the Fuhrer -- like Gunther Quandt and Friedrich Flick, he had been at that fateful 1933 election meeting when German big business put their money on the Nazis -- and nor, it appears, did his son and heir August Jr.  The latter sold Merck Finck to Barclays for a reported $370million (PS230 million) in 1990, soon afterwards becoming a donor to the Far Right party Alternative for Germany.  He died last year, leaving a $9billion (PS7billion) fortune. Sometimes, the descendants of Nazi billionaires have appeared to have been genuinely ignorant of their guilt.  According to De Jong, the eight children of 'pudding prince' Rudolf August Oetker of Dr Oetker fame didn't learn about his Nazi past until historians revealed it in 2013. It must have been quite a shock.  Rudolf 's stepfather Richard Kaselowsky, who had run the Oetker family business before him, was a hardened Nazi and acolyte of SS chief Heinrich Himmler who helped fund his Lebensborn, the chilling Aryan breeding programme to create the 'master race'.  Kaselowsky would hand copies of Hitler's Mein Kampf to new employees and hung a portrait of the Fuhrer in his office.  His stepson Rudolf August served as a major in the Waffen SS and venerated his stepfather. He later slipped earnings from Dr Oetker to Stille Hilfe (Silent Help) a secretive organisation set up to help SS veterans after the war.  Germany's admirable public reckoning with its Nazi past couldn't be further from the silence and secrecy of its business ruling class.  De Jong says they adopt a common response when confronted by Nazi-related allegations, which is to commission a respected historian to conduct their own study and then wait for the controversy to fade.  The Bahlsen family, Germany's most famous biscuit maker, did exactly that in 2019 when 26-year-old Verena Bahlsen provoked a national outcry.  After boasting in a speech of being a proud capitalist who deserved her fortune, she told an interviewer her family firm had paid its Nazi army of forced labourers 'exactly the same as the Germans and treated them well -- Bahlsen has nothing to feel guilty about'.  As Der Spiegel magazine revealed, it was almost comically wrong. Bahlsen had forcibly shipped in women workers from a Ukrainian biscuit factory, paying them a pittance and abusing them. But instead of being reprimanded by her family, Verena was promoted. y She later gave an interview -- in 2021 -- in which she appeared to have shifted her position, saying: 'We have failed for decades to create transparency about our Nazi history... And I have to push my family to talk about it.'  Even so, when it comes to even acknowledging their ugly debt to the Third Reich, let alone atoning for it, Germany's arrogant industrialists still have a long way to go.",

With the economy set to slam into reverse, the spectre of recession looms. Inflation is predicted to soar above 10 per cent, heaping more agony on families and pensioners grappling with rocketing prices for everything from energy bills, to petrol and the weekly shop. Britain faces stagflation. The buzz-phrase may sound innocuous, but it is a poisonous combination of soaring costs and stagnant growth. To slay this dragon, the Bank has raised interest rates to 1 per cent - a 13-year high. Of course, this remains historically very low. But it will still strike fear into the hearts of those with mortgages and businesses who face higher borrowing charges - increasing the risk of job losses. (And how predictable that the grasping high street banks shamelessly refuse to pass on rate rises to savers.) Labour snipes tiresomely that this is a purely British disease. But that's an egregious lie. The squeeze is a global problem caused by post-pandemic supply chain chaos and surging gas prices, and exacerbated by the Ukraine war. While this has dealt a juddering blow to our recovery, the truth is that had Chancellor Rishi Sunak not devised emergency Covid measures to protect firms and jobs, the pain would have been infinitely worse. Even so, the Treasury and Bank of England blundered badly by turning off the money-printing presses, increasing interest rates and hiking taxes all at the same time, delivering a triple whammy to incomes and prosperity. If the Tories do suffer heavy losses in the local elections, they will learn a hard lesson. The Government must do more to protect people from crippling living costs. Radical thinking is required. Relaxing MOT rules for new cars is an imaginative start. What about slashing red tape on childcare to ease parents' costs? Spiking the hated national insurance hike entirely? Or, with the Treasury raking in record sums, bringing forward the planned income tax cut? The country is now on the flight path to the general election. The key battleground will be which party is best placed to pilot Britain through the economic turbulence. It's imperative the Tories capitalise on their reputation for competence with the nation's purse strings. If life remains hard for ordinary families, they will call for the tumbrils. Investigate Keir's beers The dire economic hardship facing the whole country puts No 10 parties and Sir Keir Starmer's biriyani and beer knees-up firmly in perspective. But by sanctimoniously demanding Boris Johnson resign for unwittingly being in the presence of a birthday cake, Labour's leader has made it important. Even his Left-wing chums, including Sadiq Khan, say it's no different to Sir Keir wolfing down an illicit curry with a roomful of activists. Of course it isn't! Durham police must investigate. Not because this paper thinks Beergate is the crime of the century. Nor because the ex-director of public prosecutions, who pretends he is a paragon of honesty, has been exposed as a dissembling hypocrite. But because the law of the land should be applied consistently and fairly.",

The incident occurred around 8am Friday morning on Woonoona Avenue at Wahroonga in Sydney's north. The Abbotsleigh Junior School is located on the street but it is not yet known whether the incident occurred at the school.  Three crews along with the Toll Ambulance Rescue Helicopter with a critical care doctor and critical care paramedic were dispatched to the scene.  The injured man has been taken to Royal North Shore Hospital, a NSW Ambulance spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. NSW Police said officers are currently on the scene and had cleared the area for a helicopter to land in order to transport the man to hospital.  'It appears the patient has fallen several metres from a window,' confirmed Charnan Kurth of NSW Ambulance Service.

    "6b8fba134056c040b2735a05506041e52b87d6d1f71f111bc4d0b551": "Twitter was right to suppress the New York Post's reporting of the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop, according to the head of a prominent media watchdog which is pressuring advertisers to rethink their adverts on Twitter when Elon Musk takes over. Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of Media Matters for America, appeared on CSPAN's Washington Journal on Thursday to discuss the state of the country's media. Carusone's organization is one of 26 which signed a letter to advertisers published earlier this week, warning them about the dangers of being associated with a 'cesspool of misinformation' when Musk lifts Twitter's policies on censorship. A caller to the CSPAN show asked Carusone why there was not more investigative reporting on the content of Hunter Biden's laptop. Carusone said that the New York Post article blocked by Twitter was journalistically unsound - despite multiple media outlets including the Washington Post now confirming its authenticity, and despite Twitter's co-founder Jack Dorsey apologizing for blocking the story. 'A lot of - even people who are deep advocates for the narrative around Hunter Biden really seem to miss the genesis,' Carusone said. 'And, for people who are not super enmeshed in the right-wing media, when people talk about that, what they are referring to is that in October of 2020 a New York Post article was published that Twitter decided you could not distribute the links to, on Twitter. 'It was consistent with their policies of leaked information that was not verified. 'The right wing went nuts about it, as evidence of a conspiracy. 'Let's just go back in time here: the genesis and the reason why is that the New York Post article did not meet any minimum editorial standards. 'They did not provide any evidence: they did not verify anything that they were reporting.' Carusone was also asked, by the same caller, why there was not more reporting on Hunter Biden's art sales. The 52-year-old son of the president made his gallery debut this fall, with shows in Los Angeles and New York. Some of the works were priced at $500,000. Buyers would be kept anonymous, the White House said, to stop them seeking political influence with the Bidens. But Walter Shaub, a former White House ethics chief, said the arrangement was 'very disappointing'. Carusone agreed that there should be more reporting, but denied that there was any reason for suspicion. 'That's what journalism does,' he said. 'Boy, I hope there's not wrongdoing. It doesn't seem like there is. 'But yeah, that's what journalism should do. 'You should ask those questions - those are reasonable things to ask. 'There's no reasonable suspicion behind it, or any evidence to back that up, but that's what journalists do. 'And I think that would be a story worth investigating.' When a Twitter user questioned Carusone's verdict, he replied that it was 'extremely good, fair and totally rational'. He called the Twitter user an 'ideology obsessed dips***.'  Carusone's organization was founded in 2004 by David Brock - a former conservative journalist who turned liberal activist, who in 2017 was described by Politico as the 'Democrats' attack dog'. 'The Clinton enforcer, who raised tens of millions of dollars and created a far-reaching web of outside groups to push her presidential candidacy, is now training his sights on Trump,' they wrote at the time.  'Brock is rallying Democratic megadonors behind his cause and while he can be controversial at times, few bet against his efforts. His tentacles are far-reaching, including his media monitoring nonprofit Media Matters and the opposition research super PAC American Bridge.' Media Matters for America says it is 'dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.' They were among the signatories of the letter to major advertisers on Twitter, warning about the platform under Musk. 'Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter will further toxify our information ecosystem and be a direct threat to public safety, especially among those already most vulnerable and marginalized,' they wrote. They warned that advertising on Twitter would see their company 'risks association with a platform amplifying hate, extremism, health misinformation, and conspiracy theorists.' The authors continued: 'Under Musk's management, Twitter risks becoming a cesspool of misinformation, with your brand attached, polluting our information ecosystem in a time where trust in institutions and news media is already at an all-time low. 'Your ad dollars can either fund Musk's vanity project or hold him to account. We call on you to demand Musk uphold these basic standards of community trust and safety, and to pull your advertising spending from Twitter if they are not. According to Influence Watch, the group was founded with about $2 million in donations from prominent liberal donors, such as Susie Tompkins Buell, the 78-year-old co-founder of clothing brands Esprit and The North Face; Leo Hindery, 74, a private equity investor specializing in media; and James Hormel, who died in August aged 88.  Hormel was heir to a meatpacking fortune, and the first openly gay man to represent the United States as an ambassador - to Luxembourg, from 1997. He also co-founded in 1981 the Human Rights Campaign - the nation's preeminent gay rights group. Media Matters is funded by a coalition of donors, including the National Education Association - America's largest union, representing teachers and other school staff - and several Jewish groups, such as the Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston and Community Foundation of the United Jewish Federation of San Diego.  Musk, in response to the letter, tweeted: 'Who funds these organizations that want to control your access to information? Let's investigate ...' Piqued by the critique, he added: 'Sunlight is the best disinfectant.' 1. Access Now  2. Accountable Tech  3. Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation  4. Center for Countering Digital Hate  5.

'Social media giants are eroding our consensus reality and pushing democracy to the brink,' they state on their website. 'Accountable Tech is fighting back.' Founded in May 2020, the group is a 501(c)(4), which means it does not have to disclose its donor list, and it does not say on the website who funds it.  UltraViolet is the newest of the trio that headed the letter, and was founded in 2012. 'UltraViolet is a powerful and rapidly growing community of people mobilized to fight sexism and create a more inclusive world that accurately represents all women, from politics and government to media and pop culture,' they state on their website. 'We founded UltraViolet on the principle that with a combination of organizing, technology, creative campaigning, and people power, we can win. Ultraviolet leads creative, breakthrough campaigns that have won victories from politics to culture.' The group is also backed by several unions - among them the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), and the American Federation of Teachers. Musk is famously anti-union, and has been excluded from White House electric vehicle manufacturing events due to the fact that Tesla's workforce is not unionized. UltraViolet is backed by numerous family foundations, including that founded by Warren Buffet's son Peter, NoVo Foundation. NoVo works to help marginalized and oppressed groups in society. It is also supported by one of the many Pritzker family's foundations, Libra.  The Chicago-based billionaires are members of one of America's richest families who made their money largely through the Hyatt hotel chain. Nicholas Pritzker, 76, and his wife Susan founded the Libra Foundation in 2002, and the organization now 'supports frontline organizations building a world where communities of color thrive.' Not all of the 26 groups that signed the letter are U.S. based.  Fair Vote UK, a British group that works to 'tackle the issue of data misuse, voter manipulation and lack of transparency in elections', is among the signatories.  A small-scale group, they declare all donations over PS500 ($624), and only confirm five such donations on their site. Another British-based signatory was the Center for Countering Digital Hate, led by a former advisor to senior figures in the Labour Party, Imran Ahmed. The group has expanded to have an office in Washington DC, but their work is largely British. 'The Center is best known for working with Rachel Riley to remove controversial far-right commentator Katie Hopkins from Twitter and conspiracy theorist David Icke from Facebook and Youtube,' according to Influence Watch.  European governments are strongly involved in backing another of the signatories - Access Now. Begun during the 2009 Iranian election, as an activist group to organize and protest election fraud and report on human rights abuses, the group is now global with offices worldwide. Their largest donor, according to their latest report, is the Swedish government's development agency, Sida, followed by Soros' Open Society Foundations. The governments of Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands have contributed large amounts, as well as Canada's government. ",
    "c41a977384e65a1d88519518f8f6830f1146678e50df28c08061b84f": "The Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday it will restrict the use of the Johnson & Johnson one-shot COVID-19 vaccine after an investigation revealed that those who got the jab were at increased risk of developing life-threatening blood clots. The agency is now only authorizing the pharmaceutical giant's Janssen COVID vaccine to people 18 or older for whom other authorized or approved vaccines are not accessible or clinically appropriate, and to those 18 years or older who otherwise would not get a COVID vaccine. The decision comes following an investigation into reports of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) - a rare and potentially life-threatening disease that creates blood clots and creates low levels of blood platelets - from those who have received the vaccine.  There have been 60 confirmed cases, including nine fatalities, through March 18, 2022 from the nearly 19 million doses administered nationwide. The FDA  determined that the reporting rate of TTS is 3.23 per million doses of the vaccine administered, and the reporting rate of TTS deaths is 0.48 per million doss of vaccines administered. Symptoms began in the confirmed cases about one to two weeks after the individual received the vaccine.  'We recognize that the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine still has a role in the current pandemic response in the United States and across the global community,' Peter Marks, the director of FDA's Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research said in a statement. 'We've been closely monitoring the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and occurrence of TTS following its administration and have used updated information from our safety surveillance systems to revise the [Emergency Use Authorization,' he continued. 'The agency will continue to monitor the safety of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and all other vaccines and, as has been the case throughout the pandemic, will thoroughly evaluate new safety information.' The company did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment.  J&J's stock price slid 1.9 percent - before the decision was announced after the market closed. It's shares are trading at $176.76.  The FDA has been aware of the risk for TTS for about two years.  It first authorized the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for emergency use on February 27, 2021. Since then, data shows, 18.7 million people have received the vaccine. Thrombosis and Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS), also known as vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) or vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare syndrome characterized by the formation of blood clots combined with low platelet counts. It can be classified into two categories based on the location, with Tier 1 occurring in uncommon sites of thrombosis - like the brain or the gut, and Tier 2 occurring in more common sites. Symptoms include persistent headaches, visual changes, seizures, confusion, abdominal pain, chest pain, leg pain, bleeding or bruising. Severe cases can also lead to coma or death. Source: Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre  But on April 13, the FDA paused its authorization of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine after six women were found to have developed blood clotting after receiving the shot. All had pre-existing conditions that put them at an increased risk of developing the clots. Ten days later, on April 23, usage of the vaccine was resumed, though the label was advised with a warning to women under the age of 50 about the blood clotting.  The agencies determined at the time that a total of 15 cases of TTS had been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, including the six reported cases, out of 8 million doses administered. Still, they continued to investigate the level of risk for TTS, and as more cases were reported in December, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made a preferential recommendation for use of the mRNA vaccines over the one-shot Johnson and Johnson for everyone over the age of 18. They said at the time that it could still be considered when a person has a contraindication to mRNA vaccines - like the Moderna and Pfizer jabs, when someone would otherwise remain unvaccinated due to limited access to the mRNA vaccine and when a person wants to receive the Johnson and Johnson vaccine despite the concerns. In its new guidance, the FDA said, it has considered the fact that people with TTS may rapidly deteriorate, despite prompt diagnosis and treatment, that TTS can lead to long-term and debilitating health consequences and that TTS has a high death rate. The agency also considered the availability of other COVID vaccines, which have not been shown to present a risk for TTS.  As part of the syndrome, blood clots form within the veins in the outer layers of the brain, and can block the blood from draining from the brain to the heart. In the worst cases, it can cause a person to suffer a stroke, that could lead to death.  It remains unclear, the FDA noted, how the vaccine causes the syndrome.  Anyone who is diagnosed with TTS, however, cannot take legal recourse against Johnson and Johnson or the federal government. In 2020, then-Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar invoked the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act to shield pharmaceutical companies from any lawsuits for their COVID vaccines. The 2005 law empowers the Department of Health and Human Services secretary to provide such protection to companies making or distributing critical medical supplies - like vaccines or treatments - unless there's 'willful misconduct' by the company, CNBC reports. Under Azar's guidance, the legal protection for the pharmaceutical companies lasts until 2024 - meaning that for the next two years, these companies 'cannot be sued for money damages in court' over injuries related to the administration or use of products to treat or protect against COVID. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration is shielded from any possible lawsuits due to its sovereign immunity, and anyone who was mandated to get a COVID vaccine by their employer cannot hold them accountable if they require inoculation as a condition of employment, Azar ruled. Still, the damage has been done to several families - including those of Sandra Jacobs, 60, and Jessica Berg Wilson, 37. Jacobs, of Michigan, died on April 21, 13 days after she received the single-shot Johnson and Johnson vaccine at a CVS on April 8 - just five days before federal health officials temporarily paused the vaccine administration as they investigated the blood clotting disorder, according to MLive. She had originally been opposed to getting the COVID vaccine, her daughter, Tatum Strieter-Byron, told the outlet, but she traveled frequently for her job as vice president of sales and marketing at Saline Lectronics, an electronics manufacturing service. Streiter-Byron said she guessed her mother had chosen the Johnson and Johnson vaccine because it was more convenient. But in the days following her jab, Streiter-Byron said, Jacobs complained of a constant headache, fatigue, chills, dizziness and nausea. She eventually contacted her doctor, who recommended she take Motrin and prescribed her an anti-nausea medication. By April 20, Streiter-Byron said, her mother had told her she regretted getting the vaccine, as she continued to get worse - to the point where friends and family offered to take her to the hospital, but she assured them she could sleep it off. Then, on April 21, Jacobs, who was divorced and lived alone, did not go into the office and stopped responding to messages, inciting panic. A friend with a key was ultimately enlisted to check on her, and found her dead on her bed.  By September, Michigan Medicine Pathologist Dr. Michael Caplan completed his autopsy report of Jacobs, concluding she succumbed to a 'rare but nevertheless documented' complication associated with the vaccine. He wrote that TTS brought about a stroke, caused by brain swelling and brain bleeding.  He noted that Jacobs was also obese with a body mass index of 33.3 (a healthy one is 18.5 to 24.9), had high blood pressure, chronic migraines and a common colon condition. Additionally, she had ben diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, a potentially disabling disease of the brain, for which she was taking medication, but the coroner's report notes there were 'no definitive identifiable neuropathological features' of the disease. Several months later, in September Jessica Berg Wilson, died from TTS. She had received the vaccine on August 27, Oregon Live reports, and died 12 days later on September 7. An obituary submitted to The Oregonian on behalf of Wilson's family by a Seattle funeral home harshly criticized the vaccine mandates, saying she felt forced into getting the jab. It said she had been 'vehemently opposed to getting the vaccine, knowing she was in good health and of a young age, and thus not at risk for serious illness.' Eventually, though, she got vaccinated because she wanted to be a 'Room Mom' and involved in her children's education. Medical records obtained by Oregon Live show a woman of Wilson's age went to the Emergency Room two days after getting the COVID vaccine, when she was feeling sick and experiencing back pain. Hospital tests were run on the woman and she was sent home, according to the case description in a federal database. But the next day, she returned by ambulance with hemorrhaging and bleeding, and died two days later. 'This idea that it's safe for everybody, it's not,' Jacobs' daughter, Strieter-Byron said of the COVID vaccines.",
    "54771e9cad9b99b9a489f52cb2744e083d59b22d428ad7e29d551bc0": "Russia appears to be facing an upsurge in sabotage of facilities with military links amid the war in Ukraine. A video shows how a Russian military enlistment office was hit by multiple Molotov cocktails as speculation intensifies that Vladimir Putin is to introduce mass army mobilisation. And a series of fires - one of which officially killed 22 at a defence ministry missile design research institute, and another with three deaths at an explosives plant - are also seen as possible arson with Russian officials covering up or minimising some of the attacks. Human rights group gulagu.net viewed this week's attack on the military enlistment office in Nizhnevartovsk as an 'anti-war protest'. Pro-government sources said that two Molotov cocktails were thrown and a third failed to catch fire. 'But the video shows how a man methodically sets fire to seven Molotov cocktails one after another, throws them and sets fire to the entrance of the military enlistment office,' said the group. 'And this is even before the announcement of partial or full mobilisation. 'People are against the war - no-one needs the slaughter, killings and self-isolation of Russia. 'The protest is radicalising. No to war.' The bomb-thrower and an accomplice are clearly seen in the video running from the scene in the oil boom city in western Siberia. In a gigantic fire on Monday three women died at explosives manufacturer Perm Gunpowder Plant, which supplies the army. The plant makes Grad and Smerch multiple launch rocket systems, used by Russian forces in Ukraine, and air defence systems as well as tank rounds. It supplies gunpowder for small arms. An eyewitness told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: 'The building just flew into the air.' A facility at the plant 'just doesn't exist anymore'. One woman called Svetlana 'couldn't even run out, but the other girls fled - they were all burned. 'Olga had 100 per cent body burns. She was not even taken to the hospital. 'But Ulyana was alive, she had 99 per cent burns, and her son in the second grade is waiting for her at home. 'I don't know how to go to work any more. I cried all night..' The dead explosives workers were named as Svetlana Bardakova, 59, Olga Savishchenko, 43, and Ulyana Frants, 36. On Wednesday, a railway tanker containing unspecified solvents caught fire on the territory of huge factory Kaprolaktam, in Dzerzhinsk, which once made chemical weapons. A fire train was deployed to fight the raging inferno. There remains suspicion over the cause of a fire which killed 20 with three still missing two weeks ago at a top secret missile-designing defence plant in Tver. It killed some of the country's top missile designers and destroyed their work. Some military scientists jumped for their lives from windows at the burning plant which develops new space and weapons systems. Russia initially said one had died but later admitted the death toll was 22, with one unaccounted for in the gutted complex. Earlier a Russian journalist was gagged after alleging the authorities were lying on the true toll. Blame has been put on faulty wiring but a criminal case is underway into a fire which razed the Second Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defence causing untold damage to Russian weapons research. Suspicions have been voiced that the fire was sabotage. The institute is central to the design of Iskander missiles, which have been unleashed in the war in Ukraine, as well as Russia's S-400 missile defence system. It is involved in other 'secret projects'. In Nizhnevartovsk fire damaged the enlistment office but caused no casualties, according to reports. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Russia planned to announce a general mobilisation or declare all-out war. British defence secretary Ben Wallace had said such moves could come on 9 May, when Russia marks its annual Victory Day with a vast military display on Red Square. This commemorates the end of the Second World War in which tens of millions of Soviet citizens perished. 'It's not true, it's nonsense,' said Peskov concerning the speculation over mobilisation and a full declaration of war against Ukraine. Yet Putin is seen as needing reinforcements for his war effort in Donbas. It is also clear that conscripts have been sent to the war, despite promises not to - for example on the sunken Moskva cruiser. And Russian officials denied there would be an invasion of Ukraine in the days and weeks before Putin sent in his troops.",

In an interview with Labor deputy leader Richard Marles on the Today show, the Channel Nine host said: 'I reckon detail is his kryptonite'.  In his press conferences this week Mr Albanese has been deferring questions about Labor policies to the shadow minister responsible, leading to accusations that he's not across the details. On Thursday he was unable to name his six-point plan for the NDIS and had to read from a policy document which an advisor handed to him off camera.  One Labor MP speaking anonymously said he 'needs to get across the details' and another described the presser as a 'train-wreck'.  Langdon said: 'It's not just yesterday, it happened on Monday and Tuesday as well just this week.'  Mr Marles then stuttered as he tried to defend his leader's gaffes before saying: 'It's not a pop quiz. We've got policies on our website.' Langdon cut him off and said: 'So hang on, what do you mean by that... detail is not important is that what you're saying?' Marles replied: 'At the end of the day this is contest about ideas and when you're talking about the NDIS the issue there is that people with a disability are no longer in the centre of the system.' Defence Minister Peter Dutton said the gaffe showed it was a 'huge risk' to vote Labor. 'You risk what we've got in our country at the moment to a complete unknown and frankly someone who is he is not up to the task,' he said.  Mr Albanese on Thursday faced a pack of reporters in Sydney where, in response to a barrage of questions, he failed to outline his six-point NDIS plan. He could only say 'we will put people a the centre of the NDIS' before one reporter shouted: 'You do not know your own policy Mr Albanese'.  After a few more questions on different topics, Mr Albanese went off camera and journalists saw an advisor hand him a document.        ALP president Wayne Swan came to Mr Albanese's defence, saying he could not be expected to remember every detail of a policy released 18 days ago. 'You don't need to be reciting six points or 12 points,' he said. 'I just think Australia is being sold short by this gotcha journalism. ' 'If you wanted to play a pop quiz and be successful, then someone like Barry Jones would've become prime minister.'  Mr Swan dismissed claims by Today host Karl Stefanovic he would have been able to recite all the policies, before slamming the double standards. 'The prime minister is not being subjected to the same focus and there's a degree of hostility in the press pack. That's not helping and it's not good for democracy, and it's not good for debate.'   2GB's Chris Smith remained defiant insisting that Mr Albanese should have been able to list the six points. 'It's his own policy,' he said. 'Eighteen days. What's he going to do when he's prime minister, and he has a crisis that develops overnight, and he only has a couple of hours of prep time. ",

Daniel Shanks said 'three eyewitnesses' saw dad Jorge Aguirre Astudillo leave his daughter Adelynn Shanks outside the Chapel of the San Archangel, in Cancun, on Sunday evening. Shortly after 'Addy' was found, authorities issued an urgent alert for the whereabouts of the little girl's mother Tahnee, 32, from Queensland's Whitsundays.  Ms Shanks had been holidaying around the Yucatan peninsula and was set to return to Australia after her relationship broke down with her partner Mr Astudillo.  'We have got great concerns for our sister and we are doing everything we can to get her home safely,' Mr Shanks told Sunrise on Friday.  His niece is being kept in an orphanage while Mr Shank's mother Leanne and brother Ben intend to catch a plane to Mexico as soon as possible.  Mr Shanks is unable to travel there personally because he is unvaccinated.  The distraught sibling said Ms Shanks had stopped using social media days before she went missing.  Before that, she had made several posts alluding to love, heartbreak and self-motivation.  One post featured a poem describing a woman who had lost her 'spark', another was a song discussing failed relationships while another listed 'Ten Painful Truths'. Ms Shanks also gushed over her family and used a photo of her daughter as her profile picture and snapshots of family celebrations for her Facebook banner.  In several photos, Adelynn is seen at a farm with her family and feeding a goat through a baby bottle, milking a cow and petting animals.  Another set of photos showed Ms Shanks swimming in a pool with her daughter who is wearing inflatable armbands and smiling from ear to ear with joy.   'Look, it is very out of character, she is always on social media, she is always posting photos of her and Addie constantly, it is a constant stream of it, so for her to drop off, we knew something was wrong,' Mr Shanks said. 'For this to happen is just tragic and heartbreaking. I haven't slept for three days, you can probably tell and I am just exhausted.  'I can't go over myself due to not being vaccinated thanks to all our rules here in Australia so I have had to let my brother and mother go and do this for the family. It is quite scary.' In early April, Ms Shanks had taken to Facebook to make a series of posts alluding to mental health. On April 7, she shared a post that listed 'Ten Painful Truths'. 'The average human life is relatively short', 'You don't have to wait for an apology to forgive' and 'It's not other people's job to love you; it's yours', were among the phrases. On April 10, Ms Shanks shared a post that discussed 'feeling down is a good sign'. 'Feeling 'down' is an indication that something within you is seeking to be released,' the post read.  'Any negative emotion that is in your awareness is only ever there because it's seeking to be freed, it's not there to be pushed down, fought against or ignored.'  'Instead of fighting that feeling seek to understand why it's there. Negative emotion is often an indication that you believe something that either isn't true or isn't in your highest good, about yourself, others or what you desire.'  On April 15, Ms Shanks made a post of a music video called 'Beautifully Cruel'. The lyrics allude to a person selling their soul to the devil and failing to find love.  'You sold your soul to the devil. When you stopped believing in love, you ventured far to find it. But at last you'd given up,' the lyrics read. Another Facebook post references a poem about a woman who who has lost her spark and who has started to fade. Mr Shanks said he was alerted to his sister's disappearance after receiving a message from a friend on social media about his niece. 'We've had a friend of ours send us a photo that's been posted on one of the Cancun social media sites and said, is this your niece?' he told Today. 'We were woken up in the middle of the night and confirmed it was. We haven't been able to get in touch with my sister.'  Mr Shanks previously told the ABC his sister claimed she was on a little holiday with her family in a small fishing village with poor reception but something felt off.  'I'm assuming I was talking to him (Mr Astudillo),' he said.  Mr Shanks said his niece was 'dumped' at a church in the Mexican tourist town late at night and was found wandering the streets.  As for his sister, she sent photos of the beaches they were visiting but 'next minute nothing from her'.  Mr Shanks has offered a $5000 reward for his sister's safe return and has spent the last two days dealing with Mexican and Australian authorities The last know photos of the Ms Shanks and Mr Astudillo show them in Las Coloradas, one province plus 150 kilometres from where their daughter was found in Cancun on Mexico's tropical southern tip.  Ms Shanks has no family in Mexico with her but is normally active on social media. However her family hasn't heard from her for days. Mr Shanks has been trying to contact Mr Astudillo, who drives a white Toyota Tundra.  Daily Mail Australia doesn't suggest that the ex-partner is involved in her disappearance. A police public appeal for information about Ms Shanks' whereabouts have been widely shared on both sides of the world.  It's understood Ms Shanks was weeks away from heading home back to Australia with her daughter next month after she recently separated from her partner. Witnesses say they saw a man pass Adelynn to a stranger in front of a church in the 220 Quintana Roo district. Another brother, Benjamin Shanks, and their mother Leanne will head to Mexico on Friday to join the search.  Ben told 7News he had received a call on Tuesday from Tahnee's former Australian boyfriend who had originally lived with her when they travelled to Mexico.  A previous boyfriend of Ms Shanks, and Australian she moved to Mexico with, told Benjamin a video was circulating on Mexican social media pages of a young girl found outside of a Cancun chapel.  Benjamin watched the video and the Mackay-based Shanks family recognised the girl as their niece and connected it with Ms Shanks inactive social media accounts. Ms Shanks had been living in Yucatan capital of Merida. She was waiting to receive her toddler's passport and had booked plane tickets to arrive in Australia on June 22. It's understood little 'Addy' is currently safe and being cared for by child protection agency DIF. Ms Shanks family and friends are fearing the worst.  'She's never off social media and she would never leave that girl. That's the scariest thing,' Ben told the publication. 'We know Tahnee wouldn't leave that girl on her own.' Concerned friends also hold grave fears for Ms Shanks.  'She is a very dedicated mother and would never abandon her daughter. Something serious had to happen for the little girl to find herself alone,' a family friend wrote.  The devoted mum's social media pages are full of happy snaps of her little girl. Ms Shanks had been travelling the world since she was 18 and describes herself on social media as a 'Happy Hippy Ginger Ninja meering around the world one country at a time.' Before she went overseas, she worked in Australia as an assistant nurse looking after the elderly, which she described as a rewarding career. 'The travel bug bit me in 2010 taking me on my first 18 month journey through Asia and parts of Europe volunteering and couch surfing my way across the country,' the freelance writer wrote on a travel blog for the Whitsundays. Ms Shanks returned home and saved for two years and then headed back overseas travelling through Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and the US before settling in Mexico.  She is described as having a fair complexion, and has red hair, light brown eyes, 165 centimetres tall, thin build and has a distinctive tattoo along her right thigh.",
    "6aface70b39349697343786a5261a6488bcb5eef6293ccbfaab2f093": "Dozens of NSW schools, preschools and child care centres have revamped Mother's Day celebrations in an attempt to make the traditional celebrations more 'inclusive' in yet another attack on Australian culture.  Stalls, morning teas and assemblies that have traditionally been held to celebrate 'Mother's Day'  today (Friday) ahead of Sunday's celebration have been overhauled in 2022.  Inner Sydney Montessori School replaced its morning tea for mums with a 'Parent's and Carer's' event. Stanmore Kindy, in Sydney's inner-west, renamed its celebration 'Parent's Day' for 'inclusive reasons', just weeks after the preschool wished their 'rainbow' families a happy Mardi Gras. Another 'up-market' preschool in the city's eastern suburbs also followed suit, The Daily Telegraph reported. At Bellingen Public School on the NSW mid-north coast, the P&C encouraged gift donations for dads and mums for its 'Mother's and Parent's Day' stall held on Thursday. 'It was a very successful day and raised over $1,300,' the school posted online. 'The students were all so excited to be able to choose their own gifts for the special people in their lives.' Early Childhood Australia recently unveiled a guide on how educators can include 'diverse' families in Mother's day activities. The guide recommended educators avoid gender stereotypes in children's crafts by urging children to make a gift for a 'special adult'. 'We know Mother's Day and Father's Day are important days to celebrate, but they can be tricky for children from diverse families,' the advice reads. 'Mother's Day and Father's Day present some challenges for families that don't have a mum and dad.'  'Steer away from cards with flowers for mum or ties for dad.' No everyone has welcomed the changes. Women's Forum Australia chief executive Rachael Wong believes 'Parent's Day' will be perceived by some as just as insensitive as Mother's Day. 'Perhaps the change has been made in a bid to be sensitive to those whose mothers are no longer around for various reasons, but what about those who no longer have any parents?' she told the publication. 'Given attempts to abolish terms like 'mother', 'women' and other female-related terms from the public discourse, it is reasonable to suspect that this is yet another attempt to erase women in a misguided attempt to be 'inclusive'.'",
    "e51985e8e6791f55296657f08a1b896b52784a66ffc47cfd89b6dce5": "A man calling himself 'Pro-Life Spider-Man' had his latest conquest at the 52-story New York Times building in Manhattan just days after being arrested for scaling a building in San Francisco and says he's been encouraged by the draft leaking of the Supreme Court's potential overturn of Roe vs. Wade.  Maison DesChamps, 22, had someone with him to record video as he climbed the 721-foot building on Eighth Avenue and West 40th around 5 a.m. Thursday.  DesChamps hung a sign on the building's sixth and seventh floors that read 'ABORTION KILLS MORE THAN 911 EVERY WEEK!' He then hung a second banner with an image of a fetus that called out a specific doctor he accuses of 'killing this baby.'   Police in New York said that they were made aware of the two banners but DesChamps does not appear to have been arrested.   'Hey Instagram, I put up my banners,' DesChamps said in one Instagram clip. 'No one seems to be home this early, but they're gonna like my banner, I'll tell you that.' 'I am pretty high up, about halfway, I'd say, maybe, I don't know,' he added. 'But damn, I think I'm gonna make it up to the boss level before they figure out I'm up here. No one's seen me yet. Kind of cool. He claimed that once he reached his peak, he went inside and climbed his way down several flights of stairs.   'It's a lot easier when they let you down the elevator, let me tell you,' he said . 'The stairs thing is hard. I'm tired.' 'I'm gonna be pissed if I run down all these stairs and they're waiting for me at the bottom,' he added. 'It's gonna suck.' The Times criticized DesChamps for his efforts in a statement on Thursday. 'While we fully support an individual's right to express their point of view, this was an unlawful and dangerous act,' Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said. This has become a regular act for DesChamps, a senior at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.  DesChamps just two days ago climbed San Francisco's Salesforce Tower, California's tallest skyscraper at 61 stories and 1,070 feet.  Officers placed DesChamps in custody once he climbed all 61 floors to reach the tower's roof. He appeared to only be wearing a hoodie, as several office workers inside the tower recorded footage of the climber reaching their floors without any climbing gear.  DesChamps is an experienced rock climber, according to his website, which also reveals that he wanted to climb the tower to 'put a doctor behind bars,' as well as raise at least a million dollars for charities advocating for women who are pro-life. He said the leaked draft of Justice Samuel Alito's decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade gave him extra motivation.  'These doctors are literally killing these babies on the table and leaving them out to die,' he said. 'We're not trying to yell at women who want to have an abortion, we don't want to blame them...we just want to let them know there are other options.'  It's not known how much money DesChamps was able to raise or if he reached his million dollar goal.  'I am a rock climber that has recently started climbing Skyscrapers to end abortion,' his website - www.prolifespiderman.com - says.  The Times building has been an attractive nuisance for climbers because the ceramic rods on the building are spaced closely together.  Climbers protesting global warming, Al Qaeda and other causes have scaled the building in the past, leading to some of the rods being removed. However, people have still climbed the building in recent years.  The Roe v. Wade decision nearly 50 years ago recognized that the right to personal privacy under the US Constitution protects a woman's ability to terminate her pregnancy. On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court decided that the constitutional right to privacy applied to abortion. Roe was 'Jane Roe,' a pseudonym for Norma McCorvey, a single mother pregnant for the third time, who wanted an abortion. She sued the Dallas attorney general Henry Wade over a Texas law that made it a crime to terminate a pregnancy except in cases of rape or incest, or when the mother's life was in danger. Roe's lawyers said she was unable to travel out of the state to obtain an abortion and argued that the law was too vague and infringed on her constitutional rights. Filing a complaint alongside her was Texas doctor James Hallford, who argued the law's medical provision was vague, and that he was unable to reliably determine which of his patients fell into the allowed category. The 'Does', another couple who were childless, also filed a companion complaint, saying that medical risks made it unsafe but not life-threatening for the wife to carry a pregnancy to term, and arguing they should be able to obtain a safe, legal abortion should she become pregnant. The trio of complaints - from a woman who wanted an abortion, a doctor who wanted to perform them and a non-pregnant woman who wanted the right if the need arose - ultimately reached the nation's top court. The court heard arguments twice, and then waited until after Republican president Richard Nixon's re-election, in November 1972. Only the following January did it offer its historic seven-to-two decision - overturning the Texas laws and setting a legal precedent that has had ramifications in all 50 states.",

Some daring young BMX riders even jumped their then trendy new bikes over friends and relations brave enough lie on the ground beneath them, through a bonfire, or even - with zero chancing of ever reaching dry land - off a pier into the sea, as these photos from those heady days show. They are all from a new book telling the story of the BMX (it stands for bicycle motocross) craze in the 1980s when the bikes were a must-have. Barely a garden or park was seen without them as riders delighted in pulling all manner of stunts and off-road shenanigans. Some went the whole hog with helmets and fancy racing suits, but in those pre-health and safety obsessed days many were simply having too much fun to bother. Now, of course, it is an Olympic sport too - and one at which Beth Shriever won gold and Kye Whyte silver at the Tokyo Olympics last year. But for the books' three co-authors, the old days of thrills and spills will always have the most special place in their hearts. Antony Frascina, 50, an infant school teacher from Wigan, said: 'In the early 80s BMX appeared from nowhere like a lightning bolt and changed my life forever. It was shiny and chrome and new. It was exciting and aspirational. It was often dangerous and scary but that was half the fun of it. Like any first love it never leaves you.' With friends and fellow BMX fans Andrew Rigby, 44, an intensive care nurse from Liverpool, and Clint Pilkington, 46, a solutions architect from Manchester, he spent three years collecting hundreds of nostalgic photos and anecdotes from that glorious early era for the book, titled We Were Rad. 'Rad', short for radical, was BMX-ers' slang for being cool or going higher or faster than anyone else. The trio are well-known at BMX shows and have won prizes for building 'old school' bikes.  The book focuses on the everyday riders from the 1980s who, as Antony puts it, enjoyed those 'seemingly endless summers and the freedom of riding their bikes all day until the street lights came on at night and it was time to go home.' Clint said the BMX he got as present one Christmas was 'more than just a new set of tyres, it was the keys to the palace, the gateway to freedom, the door to Narnia. I lived on that thing.' Andrew said the emergence and growth of BMX 'gave us the ability to gain a degree of independence and freedom from a young age. We met new people of different ages and backgrounds. BMX united us. For those magical few years, BMX was everywhere and meant everything.' We Were Rad, priced PS45, is available via www.wewererad.com",

Having said the curry was consumed during a break from work, Sir Keir has struggled to prove that he carried out any duties after he was filmed holding a bottle of beer at Durham Miners Hall at 10.04pm.  An 'online event for members' cited as an example concluded at 9.18pm. Sir Keir has also said he recorded 'pieces to camera' for social media - but just one Facebook clip appears to have been recorded that day, and it was shot during daylight hours.

    "90a7f26e5a711f3fc8f7c87f32b843171dcab6572ed8285d6ee772b4": "The Writers Guild is urging Hollywood to stop film production in states that ban abortion following the leaked Supreme Court draft decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.  On Wednesday the The Writers Guild of America West, the union that represents writers in film, television, radio and internet programming, called on their employers to not film in states that ban abortion and instead opt for locations where abortion will be preserved by state law.  'In light of the leaked #SupremeCourt draft opinion on #abortionrights, we want to reaffirm our Guild's commitment to fighting on our members' behalf against inequality and discrimination,' the labor union tweeted on Wednesday.  'Women's rights are human rights, and any laws that ban or limit a woman's right to choose are dangerous and set a precedent for further erosion of our collective civil rights,' WGAW tweeted.  'We call on our employers to consider the laws of each state when choosing production locations to ensure that our members will never be denied full access to reproductive healthcare,' another tweet added.  The plea to Hollywood comes days after a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion written by Samuel Alito and published by POLITICO revealed that the court has voted to strike down the landmark 1973 ruling Rove v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the United States. Alito wrote in part, 'Roe was egregiously wrong from the start.' The George W. Bush-appointed justice goes on to say that the issue of abortion should be returned to the 'people's elected representatives' to decide. The opinion was drafted in February 2022. It's likely that a final ruling will be made public within the next two months, reports Politico. Currently more than half of all US states have some kind of abortion ban law that is likely to take effect if Roe v Wade is overturned by the United States Supreme Court, according to a report.  According to the pro-reproductive rights group The Guttmacher Institute, at least 22 states have laws on the books that would come into effect once the decision is officially adopted. The organization also identified four more states that it expects to pass new abortion bans in the near future, marking a total of 26 states that appear set to ban the procedures The 18 states that have near-total bans on abortion already on the books are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. In addition, Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, and South Carolina all have laws that ban abortions after the six-week mark. At the time of writing, those six-week bans have been ruled unconstitutional. The Writers Guild called for Hollywood to 'reassess' production in Florida in March after Governor Ron DeSantis passed the so-called 'Don't Say Gay' bill.  'We urge all WGA signatory companies to reassess not only their political giving, but also where they choose to spend their production dollars,' the guild said in a statement. 'Show, don't tell, that you value the LGBTQ+ community.' In 2019, actors called for Hollywood to cancel production in the Georgia in response to the signing of the 'heartbeat' abortion law.   But producer and actor Tyler Perry said despite not agreeing with the bill, cancelling production in the state could backfire.  'What I know about this industry is that there are 94,000-plus or 98,000 people who are in this industry and who are benefiting from it greatly,' he said told AP in 2019. 'And that's a lot of votes.'",
    "b337b8adf2491848f7392ceb876d4eb4e20274cd5c0fe4f198ad90c8": "White House press secretary Jen Psaki refused to condemn on Thursday plans for protests to take place outside of conservative Supreme Court justices' homes over the leaked draft opinion that suggests they plan to overturn Roe v. Wade.  'Look, I think the president's view is that there's a lot of passion, a lot of fear, a lot of sadness from many, many people across this country about what they saw in that leaked document,' Psaki said. 'We obviously want people's privacy to be respected.' She added to the query, asked by Fox News Channel's Peter Doocy, 'I don't have an official U.S. Government position on where people protest.' Doocy was citing a Fox News report that said pro-choice activists - under the moniker 'Ruth Sent Us,' after the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a proponent of Roe - published what are likely the home addresses of Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Chief Justice John Roberts.  Reporting surrounding the leak of the draft opinion by Alito - which overturns the landmark 1973 abortion case that nationally legalized the termination of pregnancies - suggests he would be joined by Barrett, Kavanaugh, Thomas and Gorsuch.  Roberts, who has voted with liberals on some key issues like Obamacare, reportedly wouldn't completely overturn the ruling.   'Is that the kind of thing this president wants to help your side make their point?' Doocy asked at Thursday's press briefing.  'We want people to protest peacefully if they want to protest. That is certainly what the president's view would be,' Psaki said.  She went on, ' I think we shouldn't lose the point here.' 'The reason people are protesting is because women across the country are worried about their fundamental rights - that had been law for 50 years - their rights to make choices about their own bodies and their own healthcare are at risk,' the press secretary said. 'That's why people are protesting. They're unhappy. They're scared.' During the briefing, she also suggested conservatives were making too big of a fuss about the leak. 'I think what is happening here and what we think is happening here is there is an effort to distract from what the actual issue here, which is the fundamental rights,' she told reporters.  'I don't think they're at the same level. We don't think they're at the same level,' she added.  She pointed out that there was already a call for an investigation from the leadership of the Supreme Court and decisions about a probe would be made by the Department of Justice.  'That's how government is set up,' she noted.  She then reiterated her point that the leak and the content of the draft should not be equated in terms of seriousness.  'But at the same time, what we've also seen ... is many Republicans, who are trying ot overturn a woman's fundamentals rights, try to make this about the leak. This is not about the leak,' she argued. 'This is about women's healthcare, and women having access to healthcare and making choies with their doctors.'  'And we are working to not allow that to be the distraction,' Psaki said.  ",

The suspended MP then posted a picture of a former Bermondsey councillor who was canvassing, saying it was great to have him out for Bermondsey Labour and that he hoped the party would win in south London again. A Labour spokesperson told MailOnline that it was 'absolutely' appropriate that Mr Coyle should be allowed to campaign, adding that they were grateful for all those who has been out campaigning for Labour today. Mr Coyle has been suspended from the Labour Party as an MP and a member since February 11 - when a Business Insider journalist alleged that he had joked about 'Fu Manchu' and made disparaging remarks about his Chinese heritage during a conversation in Strangers' Bar at Parliament on February 1. Henry Dyer, a British-Chinese journalist for Insider, said that the MP had told him that he looked as though he had 'been giving renminbi [the Chinese currency] to Barry Gardiner.' Labour's Barry Gardiner, a former member of the Shadow Cabinet, has previously been revealed to have unwittingly received donations from a Chinese spy. The Bermondsey & Old Southwark MP apologised after his suspension - saying he was 'very sorry' for his 'insensitive comments' and would cooperate fully with an investigation launched by the party.  Mr Dyer, 24, claimed he had also witnessed Mr Coyle 'angrily shouting at a Labour staffer' in the bar the previous evening in a row over Labour's disastrous 2019 General Election campaign. The political journalist claimed that Mr Coyle had been suspended from the bars on the Parliamentary estate while an investigation was ongoing because of the incidents. Neil Coyle declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline. In a statement on the day of his suspension, Mr Coyle said: 'I'm very sorry for my insensitive comments, have apologised to everyone involved and will be co-operating fully with the investigation.' At the time of the suspension, a Labour spokesman said: 'The Labour Party expects the highest standards of behaviour from all our MPs and we take allegations of this sort very seriously. Accordingly the Chief Whip has now suspended the Labour whip from Neil Coyle pending an investigation.'  ",

Paul Burt noticed the child was struggling during his cross on Thursday evening and was then seen charging into the choppy water at Surfers Paradise to rescue him. He was later seen helping other beachgoers carry the boy out of the surf. 'A group of family from Pakistan jumped in, they got sucked out,' Burt later told the network. '(He) got dragged out into this fierce gutter, and of course into this rip .... About four or five of us jumped in and basically pulled him back to the beach.  'He's living, he's breathing, he's conscious, he's talking.' Footage shows Burt bounding into the water before tearing off his shirt to help keep the boy above the water. It took him nearly ten minutes to find the boy while other swimmers desperately tried to locate him amid the rough surf. The reporter said there was 'no doubt' the ten-year-old would have swallowed a lot of water.  Burt said he was doing a live report on the dangers of beach gutters that lure unsuspecting swimmers into life-threatening rips at the time of the incident. 'His dad was screaming and crying for his son,' Burt told The Courier Mail. 'We spent about 10 minutes looking for him, diving under the waves. I was thinking we've lost him, we've lost him. I was thinking about my son who's a similar age. 'We started walking out of the water and then we heard someone say, there he is, there he is.' His cameraman Geoff Bowden said he feared both the child and Burt had drowned.  Last February, Channel Nine broadcaster Luke Bradnam raced into the ocean at Narrowneck beach on the Gold Coast to pull the body of a swimmer out. British gym manager Jake Jacobs, 32, had tragically drowned after entering the water the night before.  'We'd seen this boogie board rider motioning to us from the water and he looked like he was in distress,' Bradnam told Daily Mail Australia at the time. 'I felt like I had to do something because there didn't look like there was anyone else around who'd be much good. 'I got out there and sure enough, there's a body face down in the water. 'The body boarder was looking like he was in shock and I've never experienced anything like that. I've never seen a dead body before.'",
    "f02db42ff10023dd29b97403a4fd80dda186066ae451453c8c5eae18": "One of the bumbling crooks in the infamous Watergate Hotel break-in that set off the chain of events leading to the resignation of President Richard Nixon has died. Alfred Baldwin III, who later became a star witness for the prosecution against the rest of the burglars, died after a battle with cancer in January 2020 but his death was not made public until now. He was 83 years old.  His death was made public thanks to an updated version of the book 'The Watergate Burglars' by Shane O'Sullivan, which was released on May 3. Baldwin's testimony, as well as the reporting of The Washington Post's Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, laid the 1972 break-in and subsequent coverup at Nixon's feet and the disgraced Republican resigned rather than be impeached in August 1974.  O'Sullivan told The Daily Mail that he didn't know why Baldwin did not want his death made public. He said, 'He was writing a memoir but it was not finished to his satisfaction before his death. He may have wanted his story to be remembered in that rather than an obituary.'  The London-based author said that he came upon the news that Baldwin was dead after he contacted the Vietnam veteran's lawyer in 2021. Baldwin's attorney informed O'Sullivan that he had passed away in 2020.  Baldwin did not have a wife or children, O'Sullivan told The Daily Mail. Baldwin believed that his bachelor status  was one of the reasons he was recruited for a role in Watergate.  O'Sullivan noted that fellow Watergate conspirator James McCord's death also wasn't made public until years later.  Baldwin was a former FBI agent who served in Vietnam with the US Marine Corps when he was recruited by President Nixon's people for the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP) in 1972. Shortly after midnight on June 17, 1972, Baldwin was set up in room 723 of the Howard Johnson's hotel across the street from the Watergate complex.  His job was to serve as a lookout and point of contact for the five men, Virgilio Gonzalez, Bernard Barker, James McCord, Eugenio Martinez and Frank Sturgis, who planning to break-in and bug the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee.  It was McCord who recruited Baldwin for a role in Watergate.  Baldwin bungled his role after he got distracted while watching the movie, 'Attack of the Puppet People,' on television.  In 2017, one of the D.C. cops investigating the initial break-in, John Barrett, told ABC News, 'He was glued to the TV set ... so he looked back out, he saw lights coming on [in] the DNC.'  Due to this distraction, Baldwin missed the plainclothes Washington D.C. cops that had rolled up on the scene after being called by security guard Frank Willis. Willis called 911 after he noticed a door had been tampered with to prevent it from locking.  When Baldwin saw plain clothes officers casually dressed going through the building, he radioed one of the break-in organizers, Gordon Liddy, to ask what the burglars were wearing.  Liddy said the break-in team were dressed in suits and Baldwin replied, 'Well, we've got a problem.'  Shortly afterwards, the five burglars inside the Watergate were arrested.  Later that morning, one of the orchestrators of the burglary, Howard Hunt, went to room 723 in the Howard Johnson's where he met Baldwin. Hunt told Baldwin to dispose of the surveillance equipment in the room, to which Baldwin obliged.  Sometime later that year, Baldwin sat down for an interview with The Los Angeles Times that was published in October. That frank interview in which Baldwin went step-by-step through the planning and execution of the scheme led for further investigations into the Watergate conspiracy.   Howard Hunt later said during his September 1973 testimony in the Watergate hearings that he felt Baldwin was a double agent.  Baldwin also said that one of the plot's other organizers was not a big fan in a 1997 interview with the Hartford Courant saying, 'Gordon Liddy hates my guts. He's made a lot of claims, but how many of them can be substantiated.'  Thanks to his testimony against the other conspirators, Baldwin was never charged with a crime in relation to Watergate.  In the fallout from the scandal, Baldwin became a math teacher at Sheridan Middle School in New Haven, Connecticut. Then in 1986, Baldwin served as a prosecutor for the Connecticut Superior Court. He retired in 1996.  Baldwin spoke about his dramatic career changes in his interview with Courant saying, 'You go through phases in your life. Sometimes somebody just says something, and you change your life pattern.'  Despite leaving Washington D.C., O'Sullivan told The Daily Mail that Baldwin stayed in contact with Watergate burglar James McCord throughout his life.  According to O'Sullivan, McCord regretted recruiting Baldwin for a role in the burglary and encouraged him to tell the truth in his testimony.  Baldwin's role in the burglary was shown in the movie 'All the President' Men' starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman. He was played by actor Gene Lindsey in the role.  Shane O'Sullivan described the portrayal of Baldwin's role in the burglary as  'generally accurate.'  Baldwin was from a politically connected family in Connecticut, his great uncle, Raymond, was two-governor of the state.  ",

Valentina Galatova, 27 and a mother-of-one, died fighting in the Black Sea port city last month though her death was only confirmed by Russian media on Wednesday. Galatova was born in Siberia but moved to Voronezh, around 170 miles north-west of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, when she was young.   After Russia's last invasion of Ukraine in 2014, she moved to an area of Donetsk province occupied by pro-Moscow separatists with her husband where she gave birth to their only child - a son, now aged eight.  Galatova studied psychology in Donetsk and graduated in January this year.  Her husband, who was serving in the armed forces of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, died in cross-border fighting with Ukrainian forces last year. After Putin attacked Ukraine for a second time in February this year, Galatova volunteered for the DPR armed forces and was sent into Ukraine. Russia bans women from frontline combat roles, so she was put to work as a frontline medic instead. Galatova was almost certainly part of Russian units that have kept Mariupol under a brutal two-month siege that has near-totally destroyed the city. Thousands of civilians, including children, are thought to have died during the siege amidst indiscriminate bombing by Russian forces which also cut off water, food and heating - leading some to die of dehydration, hunger and cold. On April 14 she was killed by mortar fire 'while performing a combat mission', according to Russian media in her hometown of Voronezh that reported the death. Her son, now orphaned, is being taken back to Voronezh so he can be raised by his grandmother, the reports added.  Russia is still fighting for control of Mariupol more than two months since the city was first put under siege, on March 2. Most of the city now lies in ruins and under Russian control, but Putin's men are still trying to flush the last Ukrainian defenders out of the Azovstal steel works - a four-square-mile industrial complex at the heart of the city. Ukraine says Russian forces began an attempt to storm the complex two days ago and there have been 'heavy, bloody' battles going on inside since. Russia has not acknowledged the attack, and instead says a ceasefire will be put in place from May 5 until May 7 to allow civilians to evacuated. There are thought to be hundreds of innocent people sheltering in the tunnels underneath Azvostal - which are designed to withstand a nuclear blast - having fled there when the wider city was attacked. Their evacuation is complicated by the fact that they are now mixed in with Ukrainian troops using the same complex as their last redoubt. It is not clear exactly how many troops are holed up inside, though Russia claims it is around 2,000 including 500 wounded. Lieutenant Colonel Denis Prokopenko, who is leading the defence, said in a vide message last night: 'There are heavy, bloody battles. 'I am proud of my soldiers for making inhuman efforts to contain the enemy's onslaught. I thank the whole world for the tremendous support of the Mariupol garrison. Our soldier deserve it.  'The situation is extremely difficult, but we continue to carry out the order to keep the defence despite everything.' ",
    "89de3f292b109c0a5688f95d680c1418f344dc89b56bc17d8bc4ced5": "Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed to hold a vote on legislation to codify abortion rights next week in the fallout of the leaked preliminary Supreme Court opinion.  'This is real and as urgent as it gets,' the New York Democrat said, announcing that the vote would be held on Wednesday.  Though Schumer said it would be one of the 'most important' votes the Senate would take, the legislation is likely to fail in the split Senate. Abortion legislation would need 60 votes to break a filibuster.  And when Democrats held a vote on the Women's Health Protection Act (WHPA) in February, it got just 46 votes. The party's efforts to eliminate a decades-old ban on federal funding of abortions also died out in the Senate after passing in the House.  The WHPA passed the House mainly along party lines, 218-211, last September. Republicans have argued the bill goes too far - basically eliminating a state's right to put restrictions on abortion.  Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have both expressed support for abortion rights - and disappointment in the high court's preliminary decision - but both have called the WHPA too broad. Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin, W. Va., also voted agains the bill previously.  Collins said she also worried the Democrats' bill could do away with the Hyde Amendment.   The bill would protect a woman's right to end her pregnancy at least until 'fetal viability,' about 22 to 24 weeks, and would require abortions be legal up until birth if 'when, in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating health care provider, continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant patient's life or health.' The bill directs courts to 'liberally' interpret the legislation. The bill's chief sponsor in the Senate, Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said that the bill 'doesn't distinguish' between physical and mental health in decisions on late-term abortions.  The bill would eliminate any restrictions put in place by states pre-viability, such as requiring special admitting privileges for providers or imposing waiting periods. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had brought the bill for a vote after Texas' ban on abortions after six weeks.  Now, Schumer is responding to a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion obtained by Politico indicating that a majority of justices are in favor of overturning 1973 Roe v. Wade and 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey, tossing abortion rules back to states. Twenty-six states are 'certain or likely' to make abortion illegal in most cases if Roe is overturned, according to the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute.  Though the vote is likely to fail, Schumer will force all senators to go on record on abortion ahead of the midterms, essentially helping vulnerable Democrats bring home a pro-choice vote ahead of elections.  'Every American will get to see on which side every senator stands,' Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday.  'All week we've been seeing Republicans try to duck, dodge and dip from their responsibility for bringing Roe to the brink of total repeal. That's what they've been trying to do for decades,' Schumer said Thursday. 'Next week, the American people will see crystal clear that when given the chance to right this wrong, the Republican Party will either side with the extremists who want to ban abortion without exceptions, or side with women, with families and the vast majority of Americans.'  Collins and Murkowski, meanwhile, have proposed their own Reproductive Choice Act, which would prohibit states from placing an 'undue burden' on women trying to terminate a pregnancy before viability.  Unlike the WHPA, Collins and Murkowski say their bill would not impede on legally protected religious freedoms and would allow states to prohibit sex-based abortions and require parental or guardian notification for minors seeking an abortion. They say their bill would codify rights provided under Roe, without going any further, but would not include other 'extraneous' and 'overreaching' provisions included in the WHPA.  Both moderate Republican senators expressed frustrations with the high court after the leaked preliminary opinion.  'If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office,' Collins said in a statement.  Collins voted under President Trump for Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both of whom reportedly are in favor of overturning Roe.  Murkowski, who voted for Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett but not Kavanaugh, said: 'We don't know the direction that this decision may ultimately take, but if it goes in the direction that this leaked copy has indicated, I will just tell you that it rocks my confidence in the court right now.'

    "19a63b319024feec3214864a96f6783b4c8abff93dea431651e4cb96": "Donald Trump proposed 'quietly' launching missiles into Mexico to take out drug labs run by cartels, his former Defense Secretary has claimed in his new book. Mark Esper, who worked for Trump from July 2019 to November 2020, is publishing his book on Tuesday. He describes Trump as 'an unprincipled person who, given his self-interest, should not be in the position of public service.'  Esper, in an extract obtained by The New York Times, recounts a remarkable discussion with Trump about Mexican drug cartels. Trump, angered by drugs coming into the U.S. across the southern border, asked Esper at least twice if the military could 'shoot missiles into Mexico to destroy the drug labs.' Esper said Trump was dismissive of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and told him: 'They don't have control of their own country.' Esper said he objected, but Trump replied: 'We could just shoot some Patriot missiles and take out the labs, quietly,' adding that 'no one would know it was us.'   Trump said, according to the book, that he would just say that the United States had not conducted the strike. Esper said he initially believed Trump was joking, until he saw his face.  Trump has not responded to Esper's allegation. Esper, 58, was fired by tweet by Trump in November 2020, with Trump saying he had been 'terminated'. An infantry officer who served in the Gulf War, Esper was chief of staff at the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation before working for several aerospace and weapons manufacturers. Trump made him Secretary of the Army in June 2017. Esper writes, according to The New York Times, that Trump was emboldened and more erratic after his first impeachment, in December 2019.  On May 9, 2020, Trump behaved so erratically during a meeting about China with the Joint Chiefs of Staff that one officer confided in Esper he had begun researching the 25th Amendment. Esper said he personally never felt that Trump's behavior rose to that level.  He was alarmed, however, by many of Trump's demands.  The president was angered by the protests against police brutality following the murder of George Floyd, and wanted Esper to put 10,000 active-duty troops on the streets of Washington on June 1, 2020. Trump asked Esper of the demonstrators: 'Can't you just shoot them?'  Esper writes that there were several officials around Trump who he thought were particularly dangerous. Stephen Miller, Trump's hardline immigration advisor, was one of them. Miller wanted to deploy 250,000 troops along the southern border, claiming that a large caravan of migrants was en route.  'The U.S. armed forces don't have 250,000 troops to send to the border for such nonsense,' Esper writes that he responded.  In October 2019, when members of Trump's team were gathered in the White House to watch the raid that killed the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Miller wanted to cut of Baghdadi's head, dip it in pig's blood and parade it around to warn other terrorists.  Esper says he told Miller it would be a 'war crime'. Esper said he also clashed with Mark Meadows, who became chief of staff at the end of March 2020. The former Defense Secretary claimed that Meadows would frequently issue orders in Trump's name, but Esper at times doubted whether Trump was aware of the commands. Esper also found Robert O'Brien - Trump's national security adviser in the final year - difficult. He accused O'Brien of advocating an aggressive approach to Iran, without considering the potential fallout.  Esper said he considered resigning, but felt that he needed to keep working at the White House to balance the influence of others. He sent his book to more than two dozen four-star generals, some cabinet members and others to weigh in on accuracy and fairness.  'I felt like I was writing for history and for the American people,' he said. ",
    "cdd309afff0b3508b9f3f0de8a855d86ea3544a876950ee3a6528fd0": "The owner of a Jeep became embroiled in a legal nightmare after he handed the keys of his vehicle to a Michigan dealership where a mechanic died while working on his car. The family of Jeffrey Hawkins, 42, is suing the Jeep owner, who has not been named, for $15million over the death of the veteran mechanic. Hawkins, a married father-of-four, was killed on March 13, 2020, while changing the Jeep's oil at Rochester Hills Chrysler Jeep Dodge dealership in Michigan.  A 19-year-old fellow mechanic, who didn't know how to drive a shift stick and did not have a driver's license, had started the car and removed his feet from the clutch causing the Jeep to jump forward. Hawkins, who was performing an oil change at the time, was ran over and died instantly.   It is unclear why the 19-year-old mechanic was hired despite his lack of qualifications. A lawyer for the dealership declined to comment.  Under Michigan law, employees cannot sue their employers or fellow staff members for accidents that happen in the workplace.  David Femminineo, an attorney representing Hawkins' family admitted that the lawsuit 'seems unfair' but argued that the man who had taken his Jeep to the dealership is still legally liable for the tragedy. 'If you go to lunch and give your car to someone and an accident happens, you'd be liable for that. Same thing happens here,' Femminineo told DailyMail.com Thursday.   However, Femminineo noted that the Jeep owner will be defended and indemnified by the Rochester Hills dealership's insurance, which will ultimately have to foot the monetary damages.  'It does seem unfair, but the owner of the car is being defended and indemnified by the [car dealership],' Femminineo told DailyMail.com According to Michigan law, the only remedy for employees in cases of injury in the workplace is workers' compensation.  The state law states: 'If someone other than either the worker, the employer, or a coworker is responsible for an injury, that 'third party' can be sued,' the Michigan Government website states. 'Thus, if a worker is injured because of the bad design of a machine which the employer purchased from an independent company, the worker can sue the manufacturer of that machine for civil damages.  'If an employer has paid workers' compensation benefits to a worker and the worker later obtains a recovery from a third party, the employer is entitled to be paid back for the workers' compensation benefits it paid to the worker. The employer, however, must pay for its share of the attorney fees and costs in the lawsuit against the third party.' Source: Michigan Government   A lawyer hired by the dealership and representing the Jeep owner was reached out by DailyMail.com and refused to comment. The Rochester Hills Jeep dealership cannot be sued due to a legal standard in Michigan that protects employers from liability in workplace accidents.  The 19-year-old also can't be sued because the same legal parameter prevents employees involved in accidents from suing each other.  Femminineo says that the strategy is merely a legal detour to ensure Hawkins' family is compensated for the unfathomable loss of the family man and that the Jeep owner will be exempted from paying money in the civil case, as he is backed by the dealership's insurance.  The Michigan law states that 'if someone other than either the worker, the employer, or a coworker is responsible for an injury, that 'third party' - in this case the Jeep owner - can be sued. The attorney said that the mechanic's family was unnecessarily put through a heartbreaking and straining loss.  '[The 19-year-old mechanic] starts the car, removes his foot from the clutch, and you know what happens? The Jeep jumps and kills my client,' Femminineo told FOX News. 'He was an excellent man,' Femminineo added. 'The two-year-old who was about one at the time of the accident, the time of the death, he'll never know his father.'  Femminineo told DailyMail.com that the owner of the car was liable because he voluntarily handed the keys to his vehicle to the dealership.  'When you hand your car over to anybody including the valet or the person at the service desk at your local dealership, you better be able to trust that person,' he told FOX.    The dealership's insurance will be defending the owner and paying for any judgement and legal fees.  A court date is scheduled for May 20 and Hawkins' state is suing for $15 million dollars in monetary damages.  DailyMail.com reached out to the Jeep's owner inquiring about why the 19-year-old mechanic had been hired given that he did not know how to drive a manual gearbox, but the attorney declined to comment.

More than 1,500 drivers from bus companies Dysons and Ventura went on strike for 24 hours on Friday morning after the negotiations over better pay and conditions broke down. Commuters are scrambling to find alternative ways to get to and from work with more than 100 bus routes in Melbourne's east, south and north-east cancelled. School services are also affected but special needs and disability school routes will go ahead as scheduled.  Dozens of drivers have rallied outside Dysons to block buses leaving the depot and have vowed to stay put for the next 24 hours. Transport Workers Union branch secretary Mike McNess apologised for the inconvenience caused but said the strike was a last resort for drivers. 'We've been negotiating an agreement with Dysons for the best part of six months,' he told the Today show. 'We were unable to reach a deal and they're holding back a wage increase that's been funded to them by the government.' He told Sunrise: 'This decision wasn't made lightly and is a tough decision but we aren't getting anything out of the employer so it was decision we had to make.' Police have arrived to ensure the industrial action doesn't get out of hand. 'At this stage they're staying out it, we'll obviously comply with any lawful direction but we're here for the duration,' Mr McNess said.  Dysons and Ventura are two of Victoria's major transport companies and employ more than 3,000 staff collectively, with more than 1,300 buses in their fleet. Concerns range from inadequate meal breaks to overtime and fair wage increases. The union demands Dysons honour a projected 2.19 per cent wage increase set out in government-funded contracts which have been passed on in more than a dozen other transport companies. Ventura has agreed to some conditions regarding pay but negotiations with the TWU over better working conditions remain unresolved. Dysons described the strike as premature but says it respects the right of 'a minority' of employees to take industrial action. 'Pleasingly, the company will be able to continue almost all services - albeit at a slightly reduced frequency,' a spokesman said.",
    "3e7c486d926349ed7050da6d866fbc9bdf9473092508ef3668659b96": "Young Aussies have slammed a 'delusional' boomer homeowner who said in a viral interview that millennials should quit whinging about the recent interest hike and get thrifty if they dream of owning a home.  The Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday lifted the official cash rate for the first time in 11 years by 0.25 per cent to 0.35 per cent, causing concern among hopeful homeowners now forced to shell more for a mortgage. But Perth retiree Ron de Gruchy, 85, this week boasted he had 'adjusted' to 17 per cent interest rates when he snapped up his first home, and called on the youth to toughen up.  'The high interest rates were a real squeeze on finances but you just adjusted,' he told the West Australian.  'Back then, people didn't complain - they just adjusted,' he said.  'Higher interest rates are not the end of the world but I think youngsters have got it pretty good.' Daily Mail Australia checked in with young couples living in the suburb of Manly, on Sydney's Northern Beaches - where the median house price is about $4.5million - to ask how they felt about the advice.    Garrick and Evie admitted they had given up on their dream of having a backyard for their kids and had been forced to lower their expectations for the future. 'It doesn't matter if the beach is this close, that's how I've justified it,' Evie said.  'We used to walk past all the fancy streets and go, 'Oh my gosh, one day that'll be us'. And now we see a nice apartment building and we're like 'One day'.  'We've got to settle for some pot plants,' Garrick agreed. 'We froth over a nice one bedroom [apartment] which is a bit sad.' Evie said her grandmother had traded in her car to pay the deposit on her home.  'I can't even afford a car for a start, let alone if I had one to trade in,' she said.  Garrick said he had mistakenly thought his work colleague had paid $60,000 for his first home when he had actually only spent $16,000.  'It was so many years ago, I was like wow imagine that,' he said.  1990: The average cost of a home in an Australian capital city in 1990 was $117,571, according to a Macquarie University report.  2022: Buyers across the country paid an average of $1,066,133 to secure a home over the past year, according to Domain's House Price Report.     The couple said the rising cost of living had put pressure on attempts to budget.  'Even in the last few months, I used to stick to my budget no problem, and maybe buy a nice dress or something at the end of the month,' Evie said.  'Now, I go on maybe one night out a month.' Claudia Lewis and her partner Adam Randall said renting in the area was hard enough and that young people needed help from the government to buy.  'My parents bought a house in a small town called Mount Beauty for $100,000 and now houses there are going for half a million,' Ms Lewis said.  'So it's been ridiculous in the last ten years how much everything's gone up. It's definitely going to be hard for me to buy a house one day because everything is so expensive, especially if I wanted to live in a city like Melbourne or Sydney.' Mr Randall agreed that buying a house in Manly was more of a dream than a reality.  'I think if there's an incentive towards helping people with that reduced deposit cap, I think that's a good idea, especially for people who are first time buyers,' he said.  Ms Lewis said some of her friends had recently purchased homes and noticed the hardest part seemed to be scraping funds together for the deposit.  'Especially because it's depends on if you get the First Home Buyers Grant,' she said. 'It has to be 10, 15 per cent to be able to buy that house. And if you're looking at $1,000,000 house that's quite a lot to save up.' Abby James is a renter in the nearby suburb of Freshwater and says she will probably rent for most of her twenties before splitting the cost of a property with a partner.  'I hope I do,' she replied when asked if she thinks she will ever own a home.  'I know that it's a lot harder now. We're going to have to save up a lot of money but even renting is so expensive.' In response to the 'boomer' homeowners' advice to do away with 'luxuries' like eating out and holidays she said young people still had to have fun.  'You have to live your life and experience things,' Ms James said.  Victoria Sandham and friend Martina Palacios have rented in Manly since 2019 and have seen first-hand how prices have soared in just two years.  'The cost of living has raised since I've lived here,' Ms Sandham said, who owns a car and rents a room in the beachside suburb.  'Every time I go out, I have to spend at least $50 on mostly alcohol. But petrol for me was the biggest change. Now I think twice about using my car.  'Every time I have to park it's $40, plus petrol, and the cost of rent is $100 more than it used to be, just for a private bedroom.' Ms Sandham said she thinks about her finances 'every day of my life'. She uses an excel spreadsheet to track her spending and puts aside money for partying or enjoying drinks with friends on the weekend.  'I don't know what's changed, but it's impossible. Just one beer's a minimum of $10. If you really want to party, it's impossible,' she said.   Brian Armbruster, a cellar-man who rents in Manly Vale, said he had 'no chance' of buying a home in this economy.  'Unless you get a top paid job, which there is only so many of,' he said.  'Sydney or Melbourne? Nah. You've got to move rural, and who wants to move rural?' He said boomers who said young people needed to be more frugal if they were serious about buying a home were 'delusional'. 'If they don't see that times have changed they are delusional. They were able to buy houses for a quarter of their worth these days,' he said.  'Interest rates are going up again as well. You can't even get the money, you can't even pay back the bank in your lifetime for a house.' Mr Armbruster said he had recently been thinking of moving to Queensland.  'I love this place. Ideally, I'd stay here, but you have to move,' he said.  Libby Bullen, 24, and her partner Josh Noor, 26, had always wanted to purchase a property together and recently bought an apartment in Seaforth.  Ms Bullen, a teacher, said she had learnt how to budget from her parents.  'They had average jobs and just saved hardcore,' she said. 'For four years my mum's budget was so strict they couldn't even afford paper towel.' However, the couple's hard work paid off when they bought a house in Mona Vale.   'So I feel like I've had that mentality of, I'm just gonna claim it and work really hard,' the school teacher said.  'The interest rates, even though it is really disheartening, and also, the older generations have no idea like what it's like for us, I don't know, I feel like it can happen with hard work, the right decisions and guidance.' Her partner Josh, a real estate agent, said he welcomed the rise in interest rates and said it was a 'positive thing' for people in generation looking to buy. 'I think it's a good thing because the growth that was happening was getting unsustainable,' he explained.  'Money was so cheap previously, so everyone was just lending and over leveraging, so we needed interest rates to go up a little bit so the market softened, so the growth isn't as intense.' The real estate agent said that even though the rise would make borrowing money more expensive, it would benefit homeowners long-term.  The median price of a home in Manly is an eye-watering $4,547,500 while to rent it costs tenants about $1,395 a week.

The notorious rev-heads shared footage of several daredevil drivers doing burnouts on the Gateway Bridge in Brisbane's eastern suburbs on Wednesday.  Police slammed the Mexican Hoon Cartel for putting themselves and others at risk by performing the dangerous stunts at break-neck speeds.  But the group has responded to the backlash by demanding Queensland's state government provide more local burnout and drifting tracks for car lovers.  In terrifying footage recorded on the major bridge, a car sways across four lanes of traffic while proudly hanging a Mexican flag out the passenger window.  Flames are seen shooting out of the exhaust of another car in front as loud rap music plays in the background of the hair-raising clip.  Other videos show drivers in balaclavas burning rubber on suburban streets and industrial estates, leaving behind a tell-tale trail of black tyre marks. The group is infamous for turning suburban roads into racetracks and regularly asks their social media followers to tell them where they should hoon next.   Senior Sergeant Donna Stewart from Queensland Police said she had 'no doubt' somebody would die after just one wrong move.  1. More affordable and accessible venues such as drift tracks and burnout pads to be set up by state governments in hoon hotspot areas.  The group claims this will 'reduce and potentially eliminate illegal driving behaviour on the streets'.  2. Police to focus on more serious crimes instead of hooning and the traffic offences that relate with such behaviour.  3. More relaxed laws for modifying vehicles  'I don't know what it is they're compensating for, but clearly they have some needs that aren't getting met some other way and they're choosing to do this,' she said.  The large album of videos uploaded to the group's social media accounts will now be used as evidence as detectives work to track the drivers down.  'We have the power to take vehicles,' Sergeant Stewart told reporters. 'We can impound those vehicles and never give those vehicles back to those drivers.' The Mexican Hoon Cartel has a website where fellow hoon-enthusiasts can purchase air fresheners, balaclavas, face masks and stickers with their logo.  The group has started a petition asking for more affordable and accessible burnout tracks, which has received more than 12,000 signatures.  In a statement, the group said their passions for hooning are 'constantly suppressed by the government and the media on a daily basis'.  'They will lie and go to all ends to manipulate the people of Australia and create a false image of how bad and evil it is to be a so called 'hoon',' it said.  'We are still human beings and deserve a voice and to be considered by the government before they make their current irrational decisions on the topic of hooning.' The group argued that if skateboarders were allowed skateparks, 'rev-heads' should be given an arena to safely play-out their passion.   Hoons have become a growing problem on the Gold Coast, with groups of enthusiasts in 2021 sparking a police crackdown.  The reckless driving can also lead to more serious offences such as evading police or speeding up to 45km/hour above the speed limit.  In January, a hoon unrelated to the group performed donuts outside a busy Queensland Police Station, with footage quickly going viral online. The TikTok video shows the brazen hoon in a sedan doing a burnout past a parked police SUV on Hinze St at Southport on the Gold Coast.  A police officer can be seen emerging from the building after hearing the screech of the tyres before he disappears in thick smoke. ",
    "e8af7710f1d677d8c37a1be196ede78d176a5dfac542937bc42fe3cd": "One of the nation's top military officers was so concerned about former President Donald Trump's red-faced 'tirade' about Afghanistan that he began researching the 25th Amendment on removing a president from office, former Pentagon boss Mark Esper writes in his new book. The development came after Trump made the 'stupid' decision to make false and 'baseless' claims about the military in front of the top assembled military chiefs during a White House meeting. It was a performance Esper termed 'reprehensible,' and prompted side conversations among the military brass. Esper wasn't the only person present who was gobsmacked. 'Months later, one of the officers present told me in a phone call that he went home that evening deeply concerned about what he had seen in his commander in chief,' according to Esper. 'The next morning, he said in a very sober tone, he started reading up on the Twenty-Fifth Amendment and the role of the cabinet as a check on the president. He wanted to understand 'what the Cabinet needed to consider' and what the process was,' he writes. The revelations are contained in Esper's new book, A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense During Extraordinary Times, in an excerpt obtained by DailyMail.com.  News of the 25th Amendment talk of 25th Amendment talk within the upper reaches of the Pentagon comes just a day after revelations by New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns, authors of This Will Not Pass, that House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy discussed the 25th Amendment for removing Trump two days after January 6th - months after Esper's conversation. But McCarthy, who would soon return to the fold as a Trump loyalist, can be heard on tape saying the method would take 'too long.'  In another excerpt of the book, obtained by the New York Times, Esper writes that Trump spoke to him about launching missiles into Mexico to 'shoot missiles into Mexico to destroy the drug labs.' The question about military action inside the territory of a key neighbor and ally came during the summer of 2020, according to Esper. Esper describes the encounter about the 25th Amendment as taking place following a May 9, 2020 meeting on a Saturday at the White House. It was ostensibly about China, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien were there, as were the joint chiefs, including the newly established Space Force. Esper tried to dispense with the 'dark cloud' in the room by talking about the topic at hand. 'Then all of a sudden Trump launched into a twenty-minute tirade. He wasn't screaming, but he was clearly upset,' Esper recounts. 'He looked around the room as he spoke, red in the face at times, telling the group that 'the great U.S. military isn't as capable as you think.'' He also told them that 'we put too much confidence in our allies despite them ripping us off,' and that 'we can't even win in Afghanistan, a third-rate country,' he wrote. Then Trump took a turn toward ridiculing his former Defense Secretary James Mattis, who had resigned after his own run-ins with the president how had lauded his military career and called him by his 'Mad Dog' nickname the retired Marine general eschewed. 'This last part cued himself to mock Jim Mattis again, imitating the former secretary of defense saying how 'the Afghans are brave and they will fight.' Trump folded his arms across his chest and again dismissed Mattis as 'the most overrated general ever,' Esper writes. Trump reportedly used the same language to mock Mattis in an October 2019 meeting on Syria.  According to Esper, he interjected, saying 'There's no doubt in my mind, Mr. President, that we can beat them.' He also brought up the Army's test of a hypersonic missile - a topic that Trump has mused about publicly. 'Nevertheless, barely skipping a beat, he continued down his list of complaints, including his old favorite that 'the U.S. Navy ships are ugly and broken,' followed by a quick recitation of the USS Ford's flaws, and so on, and so on, and so on.'  'I could barely get a word in defense,' Esper writes. He says the Joint Chiefs were 'stone-faced' and that he himself was 'concerned.' Esper was reduced to 'ploys to arrest his behavior,' but none seemed to work.   'For all the money being spent on the military--$2.5 trillion that I gave you to rebuild the military-- you can't fight. You can't win,' Trump vented.  Trump appeared unable to listen to counter-arguments, stuck in 'transit mode.'  Esper's main immediate concern was how it would all affect senior military leaders.     'How stupid of the president, I thought, to do something like this. To make false claims and baseless complaints about the capabilities and readiness of the U.S. military to these officers -- professionals who had spent their adult lives in uniform defending the country, risking them in many cases, and usually spending long periods away from their families in the process--was reprehensible.' Trump would ultimately negotiate a withdrawal date for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, despite resistance from top military brass. President Joe Biden pulled out remaining forces early in his term in a chaotic withdrawal.  Esper's own exit coincided with a tumultuous period. Trump tweeted Nov. 9, 2020 that he had been 'terminated,' just days after the election that would put Joe Biden in office. He was replaced by Christopher Miller as Acting Secretary of Defense.  According to reports at the time, Esper already had a resignation letter after a summer spat with Trump over using the military to put down domestic protests.  According to another excerpt from Esper's book, which is out May 10, Trump also spoke to him about having the military shoot protesters during George Floyd protets. 'Can't you just shoot them?' Trump asked, according to Esper. 'Just shoot them in the legs or something?' The 25th Amendment establishes a mechanism for the president a majority of the cabinet to vote for his temporary removal by issuing a 'written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' According to Bob Woodward and Robert Costa's book, Peril, Milley 'was certain that Trump had gone into a serious mental decline in the aftermath of the election' in 2020. Trump was going after Esper and his Defense team even when Esper was still in office.  He said in September 2020: 'I'm not saying the military is in love with me; the soldiers are. The top people in the Pentagon probably aren't because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of these wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy.'",
    "8ddba70a3b3fcbc2d7b7ca7e176b476a980bad3c961b93be5fc8eae8": "A woman accused of stabbing two men to death was filmed wandering the streets allegedly covered in blood and wearing a bra following the incident.  The woman, 44, allegedly stabbed the men, aged 59 and 61, at an apartment on the corner of Breese and Hope streets in Brunswick, Melbourne, at 5.20am on Thursday.  One of the men was found by police inside the premises while the other was discovered lying on the street - both suffered fatal stab wounds. Security footage from several stores captured a shirtless woman walking down the street with a shirt wrapped around her left hand following the alleged stabbing. She is seen running across numerous streets and down dark alleys in shoes that were allegedly covered in blood.  Police said the woman had left behind a 1.5km trail of blood with blood droplets found along several roads and a children's playground, The Age reported. Just before the morning commute kicked off, the 44-year-old woman was arrested on a tram in nearby Carlton.  She was taken to hospital with minor injuries but has been unable to speak to officers yet. The two victims are yet to be formally identified. 'She's undergoing medical treatment in hospital,' acting Assistant Commissioner Mick Frewen said.  Detectives from the Homicide Squad are investigating and the apartment complex at the intersection of Hope and Breese Streets has been cordoned off by police. One of the alleged victims died in an ambulance on the way to hospital. Police are working to determine the relationship between the woman and the two victims. Trails of blood have been seen on the pavement around the area where the incident occurred but police aren't looking for anyone else involved.  A strip club about 350m away from where the bodies were found had also been taped off.  The tram the woman was arrested on was forensically examined while officers were also seen tracing nearby Breese Street for clues on Thursday. Acting Assistant Police Commissioner Mick Frewen said there were multiple sites involved in the incident that would be investigated. Resident Jordan Cadman described the incident as 'shocking' before claiming he did not 'see or hear anything'. Cassandra Lutzko, who lives in a nearby apartment complex, described the area as 'pretty quiet and chill'. 'I moved to the building about six years ago,' she said. 'Everyone's really friendly. It's a nice area.'  The shocking stabbing comes ten years after 29-year-old ABC employee and Irish migrant Jill Meagher was murdered while walking home in a laneway off Hope St. Ms Meagher was raped and murdered by a stranger while making the short walk back to the Melbourne apartment she shared with her husband, Tom, in September 2012.  September 21, 2012: Jill Meagher walks home from a pub in Brunswick, Melbourne at 1.30am after a night out with colleagues. Tom Meagher wakes to realise she is not home and calls the police after being unable to find her. September 24: Jill's handbag is found by police in a laneway. September 25: CCTV footage from a bridal shop is handed to police showing Jill speaking to a man in a blue hoodie at 1.42am. September 27: Police arrest Adrian Ernest Bayley, then 41, in the north Melbourne suburb of Coburg. He admits strangling Jill and later leads police to where he buried her body in shallow grave. September 28: Bayley is charged with rape and murder. He was already on parole for a series of sex crimes. September 30: A public march through Melbourne in Jill's memory is attended by 30,000 people. April 5, 2013: Bayley pleads guilty to rape and murder. June 11: Bayley's history of rape and violence is revealed as pre-sentencing hearing begins. June 19: Bayley is sentenced to life behind bars with a 35-year non-parole period. More victims including a Dutch backpacker and a sex worker come forward due to the high publicity surrounding the case. August 2013: A total of 23 changes are made to Victoria's parole laws in response to the Jill Meagher case. 2014-2015: Bayley is found guilty of three more rapes. He is sentenced to another 18 years' jail and has eight years added to his non-parole period. July 2016: Bayley successfully appeals against one of the rape convictions and has his sentence reduced by three years. Eerie CCTV footage was aired across Australian TV screens showing the 29-year-old being approached on the way home by Adrian Bayley - who would be later given a life sentence for her murder - in hopes the missing woman might be found safe.  Her body was found in a shallow grave north of Melbourne six days later. Meagher had been heading home after having some drinks with friends in the early hours of September 12, 2012, when she was suddenly attacked. The walk to Ms Meagher's home from the bar she was at was just 700 metres long.  Bayley was on parole for other sex crimes at the time of the murder.       ",

Carla Ann Whaley, 70, was arrested at her home in Gilbert, Arizona on Monday for what police call a 'romance scam' that cost an unnamed Tennessee woman nearly $34,000.  According to court documents, the victim told Gilbert Police in November that she had been feeling vulnerable and lonely since her husband died earlier in the year and found comfort speaking to a man she met on the gaming app who said his name was 'Garth Davis.' The widow said 'Garth' was easy to talk to and they became romantically involved in March. They moved their chats to Google Hangouts around the same time and that's when 'Garth' said he was having trouble accessing his bank accounts and began asking for cash and gift cards.  A few months later, 'Garth' began requesting the money be sent to his 'friend' Carla Whaley, and the victim grew suspicious and contacted police. By then, she had already given 'Garth' thousands of dollars.  Virtual lobby  The scammer starts in the same 'virtual lobby' and then will pick a victim by checking out different profile photos in the game. Many times, the scammer aims for an older victim, but this is not always the case. Chatting The scammer will began chatting with the victim through messages on the app, and make them feel more comfortable, which can then lead to flirting and a closer relationship. Using another platform  The scammer may ask to move the conversation to another platform, like email.    This is due to the possibility of the spam feature built into Words with Friends, which may lead to this person being temporarily suspended or banned. Oftentimes, the scammers use Words with Friends as a mill in order to find vulnerable victims.  Sudden emergency  The scammer will make up an emergency; once he mentions this, he will wait about a week before he asks for help. Funds sent  The scammer will continue with their story of an emergency of needing money and set up a way for the victim to send funds.  Over time, the scammer and victim will have become very close, so the victim is more likely to help.   According to court documents, the scam began when 'Garth' told the victim that he was a project manager on an oil rig off the coast of Ireland and started having trouble accessing money in his bank account. He asked for money to be sent through cash cards and gift cards, which she did.  But when the woman broke her foot, making it difficult for her go out and purchase the cards, 'Garth' told her to start sending money to Carla Whaley, his 'friend' who lived in Gilbert.   The woman sent Whaley $20,000 in cash and $3,000 through CashApp until July, court documents confirm. She then grew suspicious and called the police, who went to Whaley's home to speak with her.  Gilbert Police went to Whaley's home to speak to her, court documents state, and Whaley told police that the name 'Garth Davis' was familiar to her, but it was 'not on her list.'  Whaley also told police she was helping a friend move money but did not tell officers who the friend was, explaining that she did not wish to expose their identity and said she would feel more comfortable talking about it away from her husband. In late December, Whaley was brought into the Gilbert police station for further questioning, where she told police she 'wasn't entirely truthful' the first time she spoke with police.    Whaley admitted receiving $20,000 in cash from the woman, according to court documents.  Following her statements, police searched Whaley's CashApp and saw that the money she had within the app was being exchanged for cryptocurrency and bitcoin and then exchanged for cash.  Whaley had transferred just over $10,000 from the CashApp to her credit union account from July to August.  Whaley was arrested at her Arizona home and booked into jail on Monday. She faces one count of fraudulent schemes and one count of financing a criminal syndicate. Detective Gary Kidder, with the Gilbert Police told AZFamily that says this sort of scam is common.  'Most commonly, the subject that the person's communicating with will say they are out of the country, maybe they're in the military, deployed; they can be in a part of the country that doesn't make it easy for the people they're communicating with to meet with,' Kidder said. 'They create that distance between them and the person they're communicating with.' Kidder added that once the subject builds trust, then they make their move to try to get money.  If someone tells you about a love they have yet to meet, suggest the following:  'They basically come up with some sort of medical problem or some sort of business crisis to where it's now an urgent issue - they don't have access to their personal bank accounts -- now they ask the subject they're communicating with. They'll say, hey, I really need some money and quickly,' Kidder said.  'As compelled, you feel to help somebody out. If you send them money and you don't know who these people are, and you've never met these people personally, they're going to accept that money, and they're going to turn around and require more money.' Kidder said that another common red flag you or someone you know is being scammed is if they are asking you not to send the money directly to them.  He added that if you notice a relative is speaking with someone online, open up the conversation about who that person is and how they met. According to the Maricopa County attorney's Office, in 2019, more than 25,000 people reported losing $201 million to romance scams with the average victim losing $2,600 and those over the age of 70 losing an average of $10,000 or more.  Sarma Melngailis, the former chef at the center of Bad Vegan: Fame. Fraud. Fugitives, a true crime docuseries on Netflix, says her downfall can be traced back to her marriage to Anthony Strangis, whom she came to know through Words with Friends and Twitter.  The series documents the downfall of the glamorous restaurateur who was a darling of New York society and dubbed the 'Queen of vegan cuisine' and details how she ended up in prison after disappearing with $2 million. Melngailis claims Strangis conned and controlled her into funneling her restaurant's funds to him by promising to expand her food empire and - incredibly - to make her beloved dog immortal. Melngailis said she was lonely when she connected with Strangis on Twitter in 2011 and naively trusted him because of his interactions with Baldwin, wrongly assuming they were friends. They were caught by authorities on May 12, 2016, after Strangis used his real name to order a non-vegan cheese pizza and buffalo wings from Domino's to their hotel room in Sevierville, Tennessee. In May 2017, Melngailis pleaded guilty to stealing more than $200,000 from an investor and scheming to defraud, as well as criminal tax fraud charges. She was sentenced to four months in New York's notorious Rikers prison. Strangis pleaded guilty to four counts of grand larceny in the fourth degree. He was sentenced to one year in jail and five years probation and had to repay $840,000 to investors He walked free having already spent a year behind bars at Rikers.",
    "c9b3d587aa876139fdb332ae5e1b337de78539e7150c40e1d93710cd": "Three years after he killed himself in prison while awaiting trial, less than a quarter of Jeffrey Epstein's estate remains, DailyMail.com can reveal. When the disgraced financier was found hanging in his cell in New York's Metropolitan Correction Center in 2019, his estate was valued at a staggering $636million. Today, accounts filed with the Virgin Island Superior Court and obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, show that just $154million of that vast wealth remains. In December 2021 the estate listed among its assets, $45,441,290.72 'cash in hand.'  And by the following March that sum had dwindled to $33,527,414,60. The value of Epstein's art and collectibles remains unchanged at $337,154 as does his $4,055 collection of watches. According to the quarterly accounts filed this week, taxes and upkeep of his remaining properties account for close to $3million worth of quarterly expenses - with $2,388,205 spent on taxes on the infamous New York townhouse alone. But the single most significant drain on the pedophile's failing fortunes by far is money paid out to the 135 women who accused him of sexually abusing them when they were young. As of March 2022, the cumulative sum paid to victims stands at $144,527,339.05 - $121,127,399.05 of this came from the Epstein Victims Compensation Fund. The New York Times has placed the estate's legal fees at $30million.  Lawyers have helped hand out settlements, liquidate assets, and sift through the complex holdings of a man who once set up his own offshore bank. Now DailyMail.com has learned that their work won't be over anytime soon as the quarterly accounts show that four major lawsuits continue to hang over the estate. One has been brought by the attorney general of the Virgin Islands, who claims that Epstein used the territory to facilitate a criminal enterprise, bilking it out of more than $70million in tax revenue. The second, filed March 12, 2020, was brought by Epstein's former confidante and lieutenant, convicted sex offender, Ghislaine Maxwell, 60. Filed before her own conviction, the original complaint seeks to recoup legal fees incurred in defending herself against Epstein's many accusers and claims that he had repeatedly promised to cover any such costs. It also asked for the cost of 'safe accommodation' and 'personal security' which she claimed she had to hire having received 'repeated threats to her life and safety.' She was compelled to sue, according to the complaint, because the Epstein estate had not honored Epstein's promise of 'indemnification' and 'has not honored or even formally responded,' to her claim for costs. In her complaint Maxwell describes herself as an employee who formed 'a legal and special relationship,' with Epstein but had 'no knowledge of Epstein's alleged misconduct.' Epstein accuser Caroline Kaufman also has an outstanding case filed against Epstein's estate in July 2020. Kaufman claims that she was raped by Epstein when she was 17 years old during a fake model casting.  She claims that the attack was so brutal it left her with a bone disease that requires costly surgery. Kaufman had applied to the Victims' Compensation Fund but claimed that the sum they offered her was too low to cover her medical costs.  Instead, she is seeking a settlement which, at half a billion dollars, appears to outstrip the remaining value of Epstein's estate.  Her case has been stayed since August 2020. A fourth Jane Doe complaint was filed in Florida in March 2021 and is listed among those still pending. All these matters will need to be settled before whatever is left of Epstein's estate is disbursed among his beneficiaries.  The terms of this are set down in a sealed trust and the details are not known though it has been reported that Karyna Shuliak, Epstein's girlfriend at the time of his death and the person to whom he last spoke, will be one of the main beneficiaries. Epstein was 66 when he died in custody in August 2019 awaiting trial for sex trafficking and conspiracy to traffic minors for sex. Ghislaine Maxwell, 60, is currently locked up in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn awaiting sentencing after she was found guilty of child sex trafficking and other offenses. She is due to be sentenced on June 28.",
    "1ac660aaef3d1517a8a23109e8a9edec2c977feb81ea808f2daa6421": "Technology giants will be subjected to tough laws to stop them exploiting consumers and rivals, ministers said yesterday. A new watchdog, the Digital Markets Unit, will be able to force firms such as Google and Facebook to comply with codes of conduct or forfeit up to 10 per cent of global turnover. Under a raft of measures: The proposals are part of the Government's long-awaited plans to tackle the dominance of technology giants and boost competition online. Ministers said the DMU would give consumers 'more choice and control' on the internet while also protecting small businesses from 'predatory practices'. The announcement paves the way for a Bill to be included in the Queen's Speech next week that will give the watchdog the statutory underpinning it needs. Campaigners have urged Boris Johnson to include this in the upcoming legislative programme to ensure Britain does not lose its chance to become a world leader in online regulation. For years, news organisations have raised concerns over the dominance of US tech giants in digital advertising. Many also believe the firms are manipulating their algorithms to disproportionately direct search enquiries toward favoured businesses. In a bid to improve the bargaining power of the Press, the DMU will set out how firms such as Google and Facebook must trade with news publishers. The watchdog will mediate in case of disputes. The Government said this would 'increase the bargaining power of national and regional newspapers, and force social media platforms to be more transparent on how they position publishers on their platforms, and what algorithms are being used'.  Consumer minister Paul Scully said: 'We're ensuring our modern, digitised economy gives consumers better products, greater choice and lower prices by having companies compete for customers on a level playing field. The customer is always right but sometimes they don't get a choice. 'We'll stop companies using their power to harm customers, whether they're limiting shoppers' choices to certain software on their devices or making it hard for people to decide how their data is used.' The DMU was launched within the Competition and Markets Authority a year ago but still needs legislation for it to be able to use its powers. Consumer watchdog Which? said it was essential the DMU was 'properly empowered' for the sake of consumers and businesses. We'll stop them abusing power - and ripping you off By CHRIS PHILP, TECHNOLOGY MINISTER  The internet and the digital devices that connect to it have made our lives infinitely easier - from shopping and banking online to connecting with friends and family. But if the internet was a high street it would be dominated by just a handful of massive shops - the tech giants. These firms have huge influence over what we do and don't see on our devices, and showcase their own apps and services over rivals. This makes it difficult for smaller firms to compete - including those in the UK's thriving tech scene. On top of this, these powerful tech companies are able to charge whatever they like for online services with little oversight. The Government has set up a regulator - the Digital Markets Unit - as a new watchdog to make sure the tech companies don't abuse their power. Today we are revealing its strict - and statutory - rules to rein in dominant firms so smaller businesses can compete. The watchdog will stop big tech pushing aside rival software on their app stores in favour of their own products - levelling the playing field for smaller developers and putting more options in the digital shop front. Companies falling short of the rules could face fines of up to 10 per cent of their global annual turnover. If they make a wrong move they could be forced to U-turn on their plans. News outlets have taken a battering from the tight grip Facebook and Google have online with advertising - despite the fact it is their quality stories which often keep people engaged on their platforms. The Digital Markets Unit will get powers to intervene to make sure news organisations are paid fairly by social media giants for their journalism. It will have the power to step in and resolve disagreements over prices. Consumers will benefit from lower prices for everyday goods bought online and see greater choice. They'll have more power over the services they use and what companies do with their data, such as being able to opt out of targeted personalised adverts. Switching between iOS and Android devices can be a turn-off for people because it's a pain to move data across different systems. The Digital Markets Unit could force technology giants to make this much easier so that people don't feel 'locked in' to their existing devices. The Digital Markets Unit will help to right some of the wrongs brought about by the rampant expansion of unregulated internet companies. The result will be a fairer and more competitive environment that will stop small businesses being stifled and British shoppers ripped off.",

Speaking in an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, her former lover Ray J, 41, said the Yeezy boss only got the truth about what really happened during their meet-up in October. The October 8 meeting at Los Angeles International Airport was portrayed in the Kardashians' new Hulu show as the moment Kanye retrieved the tape - despite it always being in Kim's possession. Yesterday, DailyMail.com revealed the existence of the second sex tape which is listed on the contract she signed with Vivid Entertainment as 'Tape: Santa Barbara sex'.  Instead of the tape which Kim, 41, already had, the rapper was handed a laptop containing 'intimate' photos and texts exchanged between her and Ray J between 2006 and 2009. Love and Hip Hop star Ray J says he was not paid - despite Kanye's later claims of extortion - and handed over the contents of the laptop to allay Kim's fears.  Ray J, whose real name is Ray Norwood, said: 'Kim didn't tell him, 'Look I put the tape out with Ray J, it was a business deal, we both ran it together, we were business partners and we still are business partners. There's really no problem with Ray J'. 'Khloe, Kendall and Kylie and Kourtney - they don't have a clue that this is a lie either.' Referring to a lawsuit filed against Kim and Khloe in 2008 over allegations that they stole money from his mother Sonja Norwood, Ray J added: 'Apart from them stealing money from my family, we would probably still be together now. 'But when that happened, I said I don't want to be sleeping around with you no more - you stole money from my family. So that's why we stopped speaking.'   The lawsuit, which accused the Kardashian sisters of racking up a $120,000 bill on Norwood's AMEX credit card, was eventually settled out of court - but not before they were forced to admit using the money to stock their stores DASH and Smooch. Despite the bad blood, Ray J said he was happy to give the laptop to Kanye after the rapper contacted him while he was hospitalized with pneumonia in Miami. He revealed how he told Kanye, 44, everything - including how he, Kim and Kris Jenner, 66, teamed up to release the original tape. Ray J said: 'I gave it to him in a private terminal at the back of Los Angeles airport, in a private room where we talked for four hours. 'I gave him everything I had, I showed him everything I had - he sat on the floor and he watched everything I gave him. 'It was everything I felt could have been looked at negatively. It was text messages with me and Kim over the years, it was a lot of different pictures we sent to each other over the years after the sex tape. 'I was showing him these timelines and letting him know that everything that's been said to him is not true. 'I was thinking that he was ready to listen and understand what I've been trying to say. But the whole time, he wasn't really listening to me and he was eager to get back on a plane and back to the Hulu show.' Ray J said he agreed to the meeting on condition it was kept private and was left furious when Kanye made it public in an interview in January. He said: 'We talked for two hours on the phone on October 5. He wanted to get back the tapes he assumed I had. 'I was upset at first and he asked me to please stop using profanities and then he started acting spiritual.' Of the late night meeting that started at 10pm and went on into the early hours of the next day, Ray J said: 'I asked him to keep this private. Father to father, I didn't want anyone to know that I did this because I was genuinely trying to make peace. 'All I wanted from him was for him to help me clear my name. I can't keep being blackballed like this.' He added: 'It defames my character so much for a dude to come and get a laptop that I gave him and specifically told him do not tell anybody we even met because I'm genuinely giving you this laptop to make you feel better, father to father. 'I don't want any money from you, if you want to talk for four hours with me and explain all your issues... I was there to listen. 'I thought that we had a good moment at that one time. I felt like we could build from this and I told Kanye exactly how all of this happened. 'But it totally went in one ear and out the other.' According to Ray J, Kanye was even seen wearing the same outfit he wore to their LAX meeting in the scene that aired on the Hulu show where he handed over the laptop to a tearful Kim. The scene also included a moment where Kris Jenner asked Kanye if he had handed Ray J 'a big fat check' and Kanye saying 'my family is never getting extorted again'. West, who now goes by the name 'Ye', did tell the family that he had not paid Ray J - who says he had never asked for and was never given any money in the first place. Ray J said: 'He took the laptop and took it right back to Kim in the same outfit he had on from the night before and then played it on the Hulu network for the launch of their new show. 'How dare you? How dare you act like you cared? This has been the craziest experience that I've ever had to be a part of.' He added: 'It brought up all these things that have been going on over the years and I really had to slap myself and say, 'Ray, don't forget that none of this is true, man'. 'Don't forget that everything they're saying is all false. At this point, I don't care how much money I make and I don't care about how much money I lose. 'It's about my life. It's about this is my truth and protecting my family. Whatever they're going to do to me now after I told my truth, it's all good because now I feel like I can breathe. 'If I was to die tomorrow, I would feel better now because I know that my truth was told before it was over. That's just how I feel - nothing matters but the truth.' Ray J told DailyMail.com this is the one and only time he will discuss the sex tape that he and Kim made in 2002 and which was released by Vivid Entertainment five years later.  'It was important for me to tell my story, the truth, and now it's done. I don't need to talk about it again and I want to move on.'",
    "89681a8e66ad4110cab6c7c84a4dd3bcb511c46bff65fa2f5ced686d": "Two men were found shot dead at a home on Long Island on Tuesday under mysterious circumstances and police believe it may be drug-related.  The two men identified as Ian Saalfield, 45, of Lake Grove, and Robert Julian, 58, were found by police inside the home in Hollywood Avenue, near South Evergreen Drive in Selden, on Tuesday at approximately 10:45pm, police said.  A physician assistant from the Office of the Suffolk County Medical Examiner's office pronounced both men dead, police said. 'It is not a murder-suicide, police said it is possibly drug related,' a Suffolk County Police spokesperson told DailyMail.com on Thursday. According to the authorities, Julian was the owner of the home.    On April 26,  Saalfield had been reported missing by his wife. As part of a missing person's investigation, Fourth Squad detectives responded to the home in Hollywood Ave. when they made the discovery. The relationship between the two men is unknown, but investigators believe they could have been friends. Nothing has been confirmed, the police spokesperson said. According to court records, Saalfield served time in prison in North Carolina in the 1990s and in New York for criminal sale of a controlled substance, The New York Post reported.  A neighbor of Julian's described him as a friendly person, who had been a longtime volunteer at the local pantry, but someone who also had a dark side.  'He had a serious drinking and drug problem,' the neighbor, who asked not to be identified told The Post, in part, 'He was a crazy dude.' A man who identified himself as Saalfield's father, but did not provide his name, told Newsday: 'He was a wonderful, wonderful, uncle, son, father. He would do anything for anybody. He was kind, generous. He was well liked. He was just a wonderful, wonderful person.' No arrests have been made and no suspects were immediately identified, the Post reported. Anyone with information is asked to contact Suffolk County Homicide Squad at 631-852-6392 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-220-TIPS. All calls will be kept confidential.  ",

A man wearing a ski mask randomly poured V8 juice on three women shopping at the CVS at 51 Astor Place. around 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday. Speaking to DailyMail.com, one of the targeted women recounted the unsettling incident, but said she remained called and the incident was only one-in-a-million. 'I was walking through the doors and the man turned around and threw tomato juice on me,' Valery Seckler said.  Seckler, who has lived in the area for over 40 years, planned to do routine shopping at the Astor Place CVS store before she was approached by the man.  As she was walking through the door, the man poured the tomato juice and proceeded to exit.  'I did see him turn around but I had no idea that he was going to throw tomato juice at me... He made sort of a gesture movement and turned around and kept walking in the other direction,' Seckler added.  'I took a moment to realize what had happened exactly ... then I thought of getting some help cleaning up.' While Seckler says she was not shaken up by the experience,many New Yorkers have expressed fear about rising unprovoked random attacks.  While the New York Police Department recorded 370 more robberies, 354 more felony assaults, and 342 more burglaries than last year, citywide shootings have seen a drop of 29.1 percent, falling from 148 cases in April 2021 to 105 last month. In January 2022, Mayor Adams unveiled a comprehensive plan to combat the surge in crime, which included increased foot patrols as well as the revival of a plain clothes unit named Neighborhood Safety Teams.  Yet the initiatives have bore little fruits as crime continues to rise, with murder and rape being the only crimes to see a down tick between April 2022 and April 2021. ",
    "4644d8718103c94e2afac5ecaa7fab0326ec256b6c7054eec9ea1a17": "Authorities are re-opening an investigation into the mysterious death of Casey White's ex-girlfriend in 2008 as the hunt for the murder suspect and the female jail guard that let him out continues for the seventh day. The Limestone County Sheriff's Office says it will reopen the investigation into the death of Christy Shelton. Casey, 38, was there when Shelton was shot in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun. Her death was ruled a suicide, but her family never believed the story, WAFF reports. Casey has a history of violence with partners, having shot at his ex-girlfriend during a crime spree in which he killed a dog and held her roommates at gunpoint. The 2015 incident culminated in the 6ft 9in 'monster' being sentenced to 75 years in prison on charges including attempted murder. The search for Casey and guard Vicky White, 56, is intensifying as Lauderdale County deputies joined forces with the US Marshals, the Secret Service and other agencies to locate the fugitive pair. The two developed a secret 'special relationship' during phone calls while Casey was being held in a different jail. 'We're having to do a nationwide search. And we've got boots on the ground across the country, following up on tips and leads for us through the U.S. Marshal's fugitive task force,' Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton told Al.com. 'So it's just a matter of time. We'll get them. Obviously, the sooner the better.' Authorities have warned that the pair are 'armed and dangerous' and that Casey White is a 'bad guy' - having confessed to killing a 59-year-old woman back in 2015 while serving a 75-year sentence for other crimes. Deputies in Limestone County will open an investigation into the death of his ex-girlfriend Christy Shelton. On Thursday, Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said the search for the pair continues across the country, but he revealed that local and national authorities have no idea where the two could be. 'We don't really have a clue where they're at,' he told Al.com. He continued: 'I don't know what their game plan was. It's obvious this was very well planned out. It could be they're just holed up somewhere waiting for things to die down.' The sheriff added that his department has brought in counselors for their colleagues, some of whom are still in shock that the stellar employee of 17 years could have run away with a confessed killer the day she was set to retire.   'I think some of them had gotten gifts for her and different things because they all respected her but some of them almost looked at her as a mother figure,' Singleton said. 'They're just devastated.' Corrections officer Vicky White kept her 'special relationship' with Casey White alive while he served a 75-year sentence in state prison for a crime spree that involved him shooting at his ex-girlfriend, according to Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton. Casey was moved from state prison to the county jail where Vicky works in February to face trial on separate capital murder charges. Vicky then sold her house and planned to retire on Friday before taking off with him instead. A warrant has been issued for her arrest.  Video of her leading the 6ft9in inmate out of jail shows she was 'prepared' to help him escape, says Human Behavior Academy president Susan Constantine. 'It was really obvious to me what was going on here was planned out, methodical, and she had played it out in her mind, even to where how she parked the car,' she told Fox News. 'She was prepared.' Her 'waddling gait' as she stepped out of her car and walked in to retrieve Casey shows she was 'rough around the edges' and somewhat masculine, Constantine said. Authorities are on day seven of a US Marshal-led manhunt for the fugitive pair. They could be armed with an AR-15 and a shotgun and may have used a copper 2007 Ford Edge to get away. Surveillance video shows the moment Vicky White, 56, snuck 'monster' Casey White, 38, out of jail.  She parks her cruiser by the door and takes her time exiting the vehicle, leaning back into the seat to grab something. She 'waddles' into the facility and leads Casey out, holding the door for him as he's shackled. 'She doesn't seem to have a care in the world,' said Constantine, the body language expert. 'Her stride movements are just at ease. There's not a sense of franticness or rapid movement.' Dave Katz, a former DEA special agent who helped hunt down mobster Constabile 'Gus' Farace, says the pair could be anywhere. 'If she's smart, you're going to have a hard time catching her,' he told Fox News, adding that he would start the search by looking at where she had been shopping, what she had been buying, and who Casey had been talking to right before they left. 'She might not have used cash - she would have bought them in advance,' he said. 'If he's a backwoodsman, if he can sustain them hunting and fishing, I wouldn't discount that the people in the area, who live there, who may even know him, they'll tell you where [he would fish or hunt].' Vicky may still be in danger, he warns. 'He's a bad guy. I wouldn't be surprised if she's at risk, given his predilection for violence,' he said. Vicky and Casey White, who are not related, shared a 'special relationship.' It dated back to 2020, when the prisoner was first brought to Lauderdale County for his arraignment on murder charges that he confessed to while already in state prison for 75 years. Although Casey was in custody at a state prison ahead of his arraignment and was transferred back to the facility immediately after, the pair stayed close, Sheriff Rick Singleton confirmed to DailyMail.com Wednesday. Singleton previously said she visited him in person at the prison, but he corrected himself on Thursday, saying the unlikely couple communicated only by phone, WAAY reports.  The details of their secret relationship emerged just hours after officials released new video of the couple's escape. The footage shows the squad car they were traveling in pass a gas station as Vicky drove Casey to a mental health evaluation appointment, which did not exist. The pair abandoned the vehicle about a half-mile from the gas station.  Surveillance video taken at the Lauderdale County Jail showed the moment Vicky snuck 6ft 9in 'monster' Casey out of the facility before they went on the run with an AR-15 and a shotgun. Casey was serving a 75-year sentence for attempted murder, burglary, robbery, kidnapping and animal cruelty. He also faced murder charges after confessing to the fatal stabbing of Connie Ridgeway, 59. The apparent lovers made a break for it on Friday after Vicky told superiors she was going to take Casey for a mental health evaluation on her last day before retirement.  The 56-year-old widow held the door for the 38-year-old thug - who was still wearing handcuffs - before they got into a black car and sped off at 9.30am on Friday. New video released Wednesday shows Vicky and Casey driving to the Florence Square shopping center where they abandoned the sheriff's car used during the escape. The latest footage shows them driving through the intersection of Huntsville Road and Cox Creek Parkway at 9.49am on Friday, WAAY reported. The intersection is about a half-mile from the shopping center.  The cruiser was found abandoned in the center parking lot several hours after the escape.  The jailer and confessed killer shared an intimate relationship dating back to 2020. Inmates allege Vicky ensured Casey 'was getting extra food on his trays' and 'was getting privileges no one else got,' a claim that Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton told CNN has been confirmed by an independent investigation.   'As far as we know that was the earliest physical contact they had,' Singleton said of the arraignment. He claims Casey and Vicky continued to communicate after the accused murderer was transferred back to the prison. Investigators are analyzing surveillance footage recorded at the Lauderdale County Jail, where the escape occurred, to learn more about their relationship. Meanwhile, the confessed murderer's mom, Connie White, has defended her son, claiming he is innocent and 'not a monster.' 'I just have no idea why they've painted him as a monster,' Connie White told The New York Post in a phone interview Tuesday. 'The only reason he came out to Lauderdale County was to get out of the prison he was in. 'He wrote a letter to say that he murdered that woman. But he didn't really murder her, he just done that to get back up here. He just wanted to be out of that prison because it was so bad and there was no food.' Connie denied having any knowledge of her son's alleged relationship with Vicky.  'He never mentioned Vicky White,' she said. 'He said he had a pen pal but I had no idea who it was.' She also claimed that when she spoke to her son the day before his vanishing act, his behavior was seemingly normal. 'Everything was perfectly fine,' Connie said. The US Marshals Service said they suspected the pair are armed with an AR-15 and a shotgun and may have used a copper 2007 Ford Edge during their escape. But cops and federal agents have launched a huge manhunt and drip-fed more information about the duo - including that the jailer had two aliases herself. Sheriff Singleton, who described Vicky as 'an exemplary employee,' issued a plea to the former jail guard, asking her to turn herself in.  'Vicky you've been in this business for 17 years, you've seen this scenario play out more than once and you know how it always ends,' Singleton told Good Morning America Wednesday.   'Now go ahead and end it now, get to a phone and call 911, turn yourself in and help us get Casey White back behind bars because you know that's where he's going to eventually end up.' The sheriff said that as of Wednesday morning, investigators 'don't have any idea where they might be.' 'We were making some good progress on that. We may be hindered now that some of that information has gotten out,' Singleton explained. 'But, you know, we're still working around the clock to locate them and try to get them back in custody.' The sheriff also noted, despite hopes of her colleagues and superiors at the Lauderdale County Jail, all signs suggest Vicky willingly participated in the escape. 'The pieces of the puzzle just came together,' he said.'I think all of our employees and myself included were really hoping that she did not participate in this willingly. But all indications are that she absolutely did. 'We're very disappointed in that because we had the utmost trust in her as an employee and as an assistant director of corrections.' He noted that she violated policy by escorting the inmate alone, saying: 'This particular guy and someone like that, no, that should have never happened, even if we had to delay getting him to court.' Vicky is a 17-year veteran of the sheriff's office. Singleton said she had been discussing retirement for several months and submitted necessary documentation to do so last Thursday. Friday, the day of Casey's escape, was set to be her last day on the job. The sheriff previously said she 'talked about going to the beach' after retirement. She had also been living with her mother after selling her Lexington home on April 18. Public records reviewed by WAAY revealed Vicky sold the property for $95,550, which was below market value. Singleton believes the wanted former jailer may be 'flush with cash' from the sale. However, he noted her retirement money remains locked up as she was expected to meet with officials this week to discuss those funds. The manhunt comes as the maniac's ex-girlfriend begged Vicky to flee the killer as they spent a fifth day on the run.  The woman, who has not been named but was shot by Casey in 2015, warned her she was 'disposable' to the escaped inmate. 'Casey White is very dangerous to everybody that is around him,' Casey's ex told WAAY-TV on Tuesday. 'I feel like he has manipulated her and she's disposable to him. 'If [Vicky] is still alive, she needs to get the hell out. Run,' she added. 'Run as far away as you can and turn yourself in and contact somebody. Do the right thing before you lose your life or before somebody else does.' The unidentified woman is reportedly at an out-of-state hideout and fearful for her life. She said: '[Local police] promised to step up patrols, but we are freaking out.  'We don't know if he is going to show up and take us out like he tried to do before. I thought I would never have to worry about him ever again.'  However, despite warnings from the authorities and the criminal's alleged prior victims, Connie White maintains her son his not dangerous. 'I don't think so. He's not a monster, I'll put it that way,' she told the Post. 'He is not the monster they are making him out to be, at all.' Authorities have offered a reward of up to $15,000 for information leading to Casey's capture.  Friday at 8.47am: Transport Van 5 leaves the Lauderdale County jail with seven inmates escorted by two deputies 8.56am: Transport Van 2 leaves the jail with five inmates also escorted by two deputies 9.20am: Assistant Director Vicky White tells a deputy to prepare inmate Casey White for transport to courthouse. Deputy removes White from his cell, takes him to booking and handcuffs him and shackles his legs. 9.41am: Vicky leaves detention center with Casey and head to the courthouse for a 'mental health evaluation.' She told the booking officer that she is the only deputy available who is firearm-certified and that she's dropping him off to other deputies at the courthouse. Vicky says she's then going to Med Plus for a personal appointment. 9.49am: Surveillance video shows Vicky's police cruiser parked at the nearby Florence Square shopping center parking lot eight minutes after leaving the jail. 'There was not enough time for them to even attempt to try to come to the courthouse,' Sheriff Rick Singleton said. 11.34am: A Florence Police Department officer spots her cruiser. 3.30pm: Booking officer reports to administration that they've been trying to contact Vicky to check on her, and that her phone is going directly to voice mail. The officer also says that Casey was not returned to the detention center with other inmates. Source: WAAY-TV, Lauderdale County Sheriff's Office   Vicky's mother-in-law - whose son passed away earlier this year - believes the guard 'may have been brainwashed' by the criminal. Frances White told DailyMail.com that Vicky is a 'sweet' person who wouldn't have helped a confessed killer escape. But her opinion has changed as the days go by and more information about Vicky's relationship with inmate Casey White comes to light. Vicky was previously married to Frances' son Tommy, who died in January of complications from Parkinson's Disease. 'I'm just proud he wasn't still alive, cause he still thought she was a good person,' Frances told the Daily Beast. 'I can't imagine her running off with that guy, but you never know. He walked into a woman's house and stabbed her.' Frances says her two surviving sons are also in shock: 'They can't believe it either. My oldest son, no way could he picture her leaving with him... It looks like she helped him escape.' She added: 'Maybe he's got her brainwashed. But I don't know how he'd have had a chance to get her brainwashed, because he was in prison.' In 2020, Casey's request to be transferred out of prison and into the county jail was denied after authorities found a makeshift knife stashed in the shower that they believed he intended to use to force someone to let him out.  But he was moved to the jail anyway in order to face capital murder charges for the death of Ridgeway. On Friday, Vicky White told a booking officer she was escorting Casey to the county courthouse for a mental health evaluation. The move was against protocol for Casey, who was always meant to have at least two guards with him. No such evaluation was scheduled that day.  'Being the boss and over the transport, she just informed the booking officer that she was going to carry him to the courthouse and drop him off, which was a flagrant violation of policy,' Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton told CNN. 'But I'm sure because it was her boss, the booking officer didn't question it.' She also said she was going to a medical appointment for herself, which was confirmed by the doctors' office, but for which she never showed.   Singleton said Casey was 'handcuffed and shackled' in the back of Vicky's patrol car when they both left the county jail that morning. From there, they went straight to the parking lot of a nearby shopping center. Surveillance footage shows Vicky's police cruiser parked at the Florence Square shopping center eight minutes after leaving the jail. 'There was not enough time for them to even attempt to try to come to the courthouse,' Singleton said.  The car was spotted in the parking lot an hour-and-a-half later. 'Casey White is an extremely dangerous person. We need to get him located and get him off the street,' the sheriff warned. Vicky is facing charges of 'permitting or facilitating an escape in the first degree,' a felony that carries a maximum prison term of 10 years.  Her mother, Pat Davis, doesn't believe her daughter would willingly help an inmate she never even talked about. However, preliminary investigation has suggested otherwise.  Casey White has been described as a  'dangerous monster' who promised to kill his ex-girlfriend if he ever got out. In December 2015, he broke into a home in Athens and ordered two men to get down on the ground at gunpoint, according to court documents. He fired multiple shots and left bullet holes in the wall during the rampage but his ex-girlfriend managed to escape. Two young children were found hiding in the basement, while a dog was found shot dead in a hallway, Fox News reports. 'He stated that he wanted to kill her and have the police kill him,' according to a police report. 'His only regret was that neither was successful. He stated that if he was released he would kill the victim.' He was eventually convicted on nine counts including attempted murder, kidnapping and animal cruelty and was sentenced to 75 years in prison. Casey's arrest at the age of 32 finally came after he engaged in a crime spree that played out in two counties in Tennessee and Alabama in December 2015. In one night, he staged a home invasion and carjacked two vehicles at gunpoint, shooting one person in the arm, WHNT reports. The crimes were followed by a chase where speeds reached more than 100 miles per hour. It ended with a stolen car stuck in a field south of Huntsville, and officers - who were evidently well known to him - pleading with him to put down his gun and give himself up.  He was charged with attempted murder, two counts of kidnapping, first-degree robbery, first-degree burglary, third-degree burglary, breaking and entering a vehicle, animal cruelty for shooting a dog and attempting to elude. While serving time in June 2020, he confessed to killing 59-year-old Connie Ridgeway in a murder-for-hire plot two months before the crime spree. Ridgeway was killed in her home at Meadowland Apartments in Rogersville, Alabama in 2015, according to WAFF. He said he was paid to kill her, although no motive for hiring a hitman has ever been disclosed. He pleaded not guilty on grounds of insanity and was temporarily moved from prison to the Lauderdale County jail to face trial. That's when he escaped with the help of Assistant Director of Corrections Vicky White. The inmate's whereabouts aren't the only mystery plaguing Casey's family. Sheriff Max Sanders, of nearby Lawrence County, said the Lauderdale County escapee's half-brother has been missing since 2017. Steven Patrick White, 47, of Town Creek, was last seen at his home in October 2017. His wife reported him missing the next day, prompting a canine search of the family property. However, the search was unsuccessful. The Lawrence County Rescue Squad then conducted a dive team search for the missing man in November 2017 which also yielded no results. 'We occasionally get a call from the public about the fellow's whereabouts. We follow it up but so far nothing has panned out,' Sanders told AL.com on Tuesday. Sanders noted that Casey was in state prison at the time of Steven's disappearance. There is a $2,000 reward for information pertaining to the Town Creek man's whereabouts.",
    "a0b3f9e71742f542712490c654d69be98b50a7666f40a0058f3aecdc": "A new poll shows Dr. Mehmet Oz and David McCormick are running neck-and-neck in Pennsylvania's GOP Senate primary, just as former President Trump is set to take the stage in Greensburg for Oz on Friday.  Dr. Oz, a celebrity surgeon, and McCormick, an investment consultant with ties to the Trump world, are running at the top of a crowded field, with Oz slightly ahead 18 percent to 16 percent, according to a Franklin and Marshall College poll released Thursday.  The two will face off in a May 17 primary, along with Kathy Barnette, trailing in third place at 12 percent and Carla Sands at 5 percent, though 39 percent of voters remain undecided on who they'll vote for.  According to the poll, Trump's endorsement did little to boost Oz, who led McCormick just before winning Trump's favor 16 percent to 15 percent in another Franklin and Marshall poll. The power of Trump's endorsement will be closely watched in races such as these in the lead-up to 2024 as the former president tests the waters before potentially launching his own campaign.  On Tuesday Hillbilly Elegy author JD Vance won the Ohio GOP Senate primary after the former president threw his weight behind him. Vance will also appear at the Pennsylvania rally on Saturday, along with Trump-endorsed PA candidates Rep. John Joyce, Rep. Mike Kelly, Jim Bognet and Rep. Alex Mooney, who is from a nearby West Virginia district.  Trump's last-minute endorsement of Vance supercharged him from the middle of the pack to a 9-point victory on Tuesday.   But in Pennsylvania, Oz's opponent McCormick has his own ties to Trump world as well - his domestic policy adviser and speechwriter Stephen Miller and longtime communications aide and counselor Hope Hicks had both been working on McCormick's campaign (Miller dropped McCormick when Trump went for Oz).  McCormick is also married to Trump's former deputy national security adviser, Dina Powell, and had the backing former Trump campaign adviser David Urban and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who is running for governor in Arkansas. Right wing firebrand and longtime Trump ally Ted Cruz has also broken with the former president and gone for McCormick. Cruz broke with Trump in Ohio too, endorsing the unsuccessful Josh Mandel.  Oz did not live in Pennsylvania at the time he announced his candidacy and his only ties to the state are a stint in college.  MAGA conservatives were quick to point out that Oz previously expressed support for Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized abortion nationally, and dedicated an episode of his long-running television show to transgender children. Oz's past views on abortion came up during a debate on Wednesday. Barnette first went on the offensive, making the shocking revelation that she herself was the product of rape when her mother was just 11 years old.   'I am wondering if the good doctor has now since changed his position on that. My life is valuable and so are the many lives that find themselves in the womb of their mother, whether in the womb or toward the end of that life ,' she said.  Oz responded: 'Life begins at conception.'  'If you go back to that 'Breakfast Club' interview, which was three years ago this month, he talks about a whole different set of positions,' McCormick shot back.  McCormick called Oz a Hollywood liberal who has flip-flopped on a whole host of major issues.   In a 2019 interview with radio show 'The Breakfast Club,' Oz says that he does not want anyone in his family to have an abortion and criticized so-called 'heartbeat bills,' which ban abortion around six weeks when a fetal heartbeat is detected.  Oz talked about how there are 'electrical charges at six weeks,' but the fetus' heart is not beating. 'If you were to say, starting from when we can hear the heart, like when the heart is really doing something, that would be different. That's not six weeks, though ,' he said at the time.  'So if you can define life by a beating heart, then make it a beating heart. Not little electrical changes in a cell that no one here would think about as a heart .' Oz, who gained popularity for his frequent appearances on the Oprah Winfrey show, has in the past voiced support for gun restrictions too. Now he says he is pro-life and pro-gun.  Trump had first endorsed Sean Parnell for Pennsylvania's Senate seat, but Parnell backed out amid abuse allegations from his ex-wife. Parnell criticized Oz at the time of Trump's endorsement: 'You're not America first. You're not a conservative. You're not even from Pennsylvania. Hell no,' Parnell wrote on Twitter.  The endorsement came as a shock to conservatives.  'It's like Donald Trump's staff is sabotaging Trump by convincing him to make the worst possible endorsements,' conservative radio talk show host Erik Erickson tweeted at the time. ",
    "1a9ddad8d823e8c503aedce397692a652ad33bca3b44dcda68be95a1": "The man accused of fatally shooting the mother of an NYPD cop in Queens allegedly told police that she was his longtime psychic  and that he killed her because he held her responsible for his recent string of bad luck, a police source has exclusively told DailyMail.com. 'The guy had been going to her for years, and he believes she put a curse on him,' the inside source said.  'He's had bad luck for the past couple weeks, including with gambling. He went to her house and shot her.' The suspect, 41-year-old Giuseppe Canzani, allegedly confessed to killing Anna Torres, 51, when she answered the door to her house in the Ozone Park area on Wednesday afternoon. She did psychic readings from her home. 'This was a guy who had never been arrested, never been in trouble,' the source continued. 'Afterward, he went to the police station and got out of a car with a gun in his hand.  'There was some thought initially that he might have been trying to commit suicide by cop. An officer told him not to move, to put the gun down, and he did. He came in and confessed.' See video below  The source said there's no indication Canzani knew Torres' son is a police officer. 'There's no connection to the son, the source said. 'We don't even think the guy knows the woman's son is a cop.' A source told the New York Post that Canzani admitted to police that he shot Torres about an hour after the murder, and insisted that she was a 'witch.' 'Yeah, that's the woman I shot,' Canzani told police, 'They tried to kill me.' 'If I tell you what's going on with me you wouldn't believe it,' he allegedly told detectives, 'Not for nothing, I am supposed to be dead already, that's all I know. This woman, you guys will never understand. You would think I'm crazy.' The source also told the Post that Canzani had gotten into an argument with Torres outside her home in recent days. The Queens Chronicle reported that Canzani is an employee of the NYC Department of Transportation. A representative of the NYC DOT told DailyMail.com that an employee named Giuseppe Canzani was suspended without pay on Thursday. Torres died after being shot in the head in a brazen daytime ambush when she answered the door to her home. She was shot twice on Wednesday. The suspect initially fled the scene then surrendered. Cops say Torres and Canzani knew each other 'to some extent,' the Post reported, but had ruled out a romantic relationship. Torres' husband, David Aguilar, told reporters that he did not know the suspect.  'Never heard that name before,' Aguilar, told CBS New York. 'He smashed my world,' he said.  Aguilar said that his wife was at home taking care of her bedridden mother with her daughter-in-law when she was murdered. 'She was the sweetest person in the world, I'm lost without her.'  He said he found out about his wife's murder when he saw the reports on the news while he was at work.  Cops said the mother answered the door at her home at around 2.30 p.m. in Queens' Ozone Park neighborhood. They said the suspect fired three shots - two of which hit Torres, with one striking her head. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Officers said the suspect then fled in a black Chevrolet, before pulling up outside the NYPD's 106th Precinct in the same vehicle at 3:30 p.m. - around an hour after the shooting - to hand himself in. Surveillance footage from Torres' street recorded at the time of the shooting shows a man with a hoodie over his face walking calmly down the sidewalk.  He carries what appears to be a silver gun in his right hand, before slipping onto the street between two cars, then entering a parked SUV and driving away.  NYPD Deputy Chief Jerry O'Sullivan told reporters at a press conference on Wednesday night that when Canzani surrendered he got out of his car and placed a 45-caliber silver firearm on the sidewalk outside the precinct, before being arrested by two NYPD officers without incident. The deputy chief said the suspected shooter would be charged with murder and the criminal possession of a weapon. A neighbor who lived across the street said he heard gunshots and then a woman screaming. 'Right after you heard the 'bop-bop-bop' you heard screaming.'  'After that I heard [a family member] calling the cops, yelling out the address.' Officials did not announce any suspected motive behind the killing when they announced Canzani's arrest. Police added that the killing is not suspected to have been connected to Torres' son's employment with the NYPD, saying they had 'no reason to believe that this incident occurred because of his employment with the police department.' Friends and family shared their support and love for Torres on social media. 'The world lost an extraordinary woman yesterday,' Anna's brother, Jose Torres, wrote in a Facebook post, 'May you rest in Heavenly peace... We will all be reunited someday.'",
    "59a61cd7e88161ac43af6a963ecf8df8a7ba964111698dc7649dd93b": "After a weekend of exclusive parties in Washington, DC and New York City for much of the media sphere, Donald Trump held his own red carpet event at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday night. The former president's Florida retreat hosted the premiere of conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza's new film 2,000 Mules that pushes baseless theories that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump.  Among the guests pictured at the event was Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who was ruled to be not guilty after killing two people at an anti-police protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin in August 2020.  Also in attendance were some of Trump's top allies in Congress, GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert and Louie Gohmert. Greene shared a photo on Instagram of herself at Mar-a-Lago along with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s niece Alveda King. It's not clear if Greene and Boebert spoke at the event, after it was reported last week that they had an argument so explosive that it had to be broken up by another House GOP colleague. Former Trump administration senior aide Kellyanne Conway and ex-deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley were also in attendance.  Gidley had previously attended the White House Correspondents Dinner in Washington on Saturday night, after which a number of journalists and officials have already tested positive for COVID-19.  Pro-Trump celebrities like Kevin Sorbo and Kristy Swanson were also pictured at the premiere, as was the ex-president's former lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis.  A video of Trump arriving at the elaborate event was posted on Instagram by conservative activist David Harris Jr. 'This man - not only is he a fighter, not only does he never back down, but he's smart,' a woman's voice can be heard saying as the room focuses on the former president. 'He warned us about Biden being a Trojan Horse for the left. He warned us about the border, he warned us about foreign policy, and he warned us about voter fraud and he warned us about mail-in ballots.' She continued, 'He has always been right. Please join me in welcoming the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.' The room erupted into applause and chants of 'USA' as Trump approached the stage.  Another clip, this time of Trump speaking in front of an enthusiastic and formally-dressed crowd, shows the former president rehashing his same complaints about the previous election. 'We have to do something that's very important. We have to go to voter ID immediately,' Trump said as the room applauded approvingly. 'They don't want voter ID. There's only one reason not to want voter ID - it's because you want to cheat.' He continued, 'You know, when you went to the Democrat National Convention, you had a voter ID that was the size of most people's chests. Large people. Large, large people. The thing was like, hung around -- they needed the chain.' Trump gestured around his neck. It's not clear what he was referring to. 'You walk in, it had your picture, it had fingerprints, it had your everything. It probably had your social security number on it even though you're not supposed to have that,' he continued.  'But you know what, it was the greatest voter ID I've ever seen. But when it comes to voting in the election, they don't want that, because they wanna cheat. And you know what? I said it, and I've been saying it a lot lately, I don't believe they're a 50-50 party. I think they cheat in elections.' The former president then accused Democrats of being 'against oil, guns and god.'  It's not clear if any of the former president's children attended the red carpet event, though his son Donald Trump Jr.'s fiancee Kimberly Guilfoyle was pictured chatting with other guests.  Trump Jr. had reportedly testified in front of the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack earlier that same day.  He spoke with the Democrat-led panel remotely and was reportedly at least somewhat cooperative. The committee's investigation has been rapidly honing in on the former president's role in fomenting the insurrection last year and his and his allies' attempts to overturn the 2020 election results.  Another video from the event also posted by Harris appears to be selling right-wing novelty products from his site -- featuring ex-Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.  'I love this, where can I get a deck of these?' Flynn says holding up playing cards.  The Joker card is superimposed with an image of President Joe Biden's face. 'You got the name wrong, it's Brandon,' Flynn quipped in reference to the 'Let's Go Brandon' phrase adopted by the right wing to mock Biden. Another Joker card features Dr. Anthony Fauci with 'five masks,' according to the person recording the video.  'This is Brandon minus. This is the cousin - the lesser cousin of Brandon,' Flynn said.",
    "ebff7ac8dc76885c192cb78c6002d526de7325c1a4d72619996a8b73": "Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts sounded off about the Roe v. Wade opinion leak on Thursday in a private meeting, calling it 'absolutely appalling.'  Roberts, in remarks to judges and lawyers in Atlanta first reported by CNN,  underscored that he hoped 'one bad apple' would not change 'people's perception' of the high court.   He called the 'person' or 'people' who leaked the document 'foolish' if they thought it would sway votes on the court.  Earlier this week Roberts announced an investigation into the source of the 'betrayal.'  'I have directed the Marshal of the Court to launch an investigation into the source of the leak,' Roberts wrote in a Tuesday statement.  The chief justice decried the leak as an 'egregious breach' and an 'affront to the court.'   'We at the Court are blessed to have a workforce - permanent employees and law clerks alike - intensely loyal to the institution and dedicated to the rule of law. Court employees have an exemplary and important tradition of respecting the confidentiality of the judicial process and upholding the trust of the Court. This was a singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public servants who work here,' Roberts said.  'To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed. The work of the Court will not be affected in any way,' Roberts said.  Roberts did not want to overturn Roe, meaning he would have dissented from the other five conservative justices in Justice Samuel Alito's draft opinion, according to CNN. Last fall during arguments for the case at the center of the matter, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Roberts seemed to be looking for a way to uphold Mississippi's ban on abortions after 15 weeks without overturning Roe.  Meanwhile tall fencing started going up around the Supreme Court in northeast Washington, D.C. on Wednesday evening as tensions rose between protesters following the leak of a draft opinion that signaled an impending overturn of Roe v. Wade.  Workers erected the massive fencing around the perimeter of the marble building just east of the U.S. Capitol building as Justices began canceling public appearances amid warnings protests could get increasingly violent. Left-wing groups are planning to send activists and protesters to the homes of conservatives justices. An activist group called 'Ruth Sent Us' has published the supposed addresses of Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thmas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts and are planning a 'walk-by' of their homes next Wednesday, May 11. 'Our 6-3 extremist Supreme Court routinely issues rulings that hurt women, racial minorities, LGBTQ+ and immigrant rights,' the group's website reads. 'We must rise up to force accountability using a diversity of tactics.' Politico published on Monday evening what appeared to be a photocopy of a draft opinion from February 4 in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization - the opinion by conservative Justice Alito would put an end to the 50-year landmark abortion ruling giving women a constitutional right to terminate their pregnancies. In the fallout from the leak, Alito scrapped plans to participate in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals judicial conference starting on Thursday, as the associate justice is tasked with reviewing emergency appeals from the 5th Circuit. It is still unclear if Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas, who were slated to get remarks at a similar conference for the 11th Circuit on Thursday and Friday, will still appear. Fencing to keep protesters away from the entrances of the Supreme Court is similar to what was erected around the U.S. Capitol following the January 6, 2021 riot.  Senator John Cornyn introduced a bill Thursday to provide additional protections for Supreme Court justice, including 24/7 security detail. 'It's not just an attack against the independence of the judiciary. This risks violence against members of the Supreme Court and their families,' Cornyn said upon introducing the bill. 'I introduced a piece of legislation to enhance the authorities of the Supreme Court law enforcement agencies to provide protective details for the judges and their families, who've already been threatened with violence.' 'Because we deal in these matters on a daily basis, to make that kind of threat to the Supreme Court is an attempt to intimidate the Justices and a threat to judicial independence,' Cornyn said in a statement on the legislation. Immediately after the leak was published on Monday evening, pro-abortion protesters descended on the Supreme Court. On Tuesday, conservative Chief Justice Roberts confirmed the authenticity of the draft opinion and ordered an investigation into the leak by Col. Gail A. Curley, the 11th marshal of the United States Supreme Court. Clashes between pro- and anti-abortion demonstrators became increasingly heated, leading Metro police to activate protest units amid large demonstrations in front of the building Tuesday. Although D.C. is ground zero for the demonstrations, law enforcement authorities across the country are preparing for possible violence and civil unrest. According to intelligence bulletins and internal reports from across the nation obtained by Yahoo News, authorities are on alert for fallout from the impending ruling. A February situational awareness bulletin from the Colorado Information Analysis Center warns challenges to Roe v. Wade could lead to unrest and violent incidents. 'Law enforcement and public safety officials should anticipate an increase in abortion-related events, rallies, and protests with the potential for violence and criminal activity, particularly leading up to and directly following the Supreme Court's decision in the Mississippi case,' the bulletin noted. A decision on the Mississippi case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is expected by June. For years the FBI has tracked extremists on both sides of the abortion issue. The bureau's Domestic Terrorism Reference Guide on Abortion-Related Extremists was widely circulated in November 2021 and looks at the threats stemming from both sides of the heated argument. 'Abortion-related violent extremists seek to further their pro-life or pro-choice ideologies through the threat or use of force or violence against individuals or facilities which provide services in opposition of their beliefs,' the guide notes. It adds: 'Pro-life extremists believe force or violence is necessary to save the lives of the unborn. Pro-choice extremists believe it is their moral duty to protect those who provide or receive reproductive health care services.' While Republicans are pleased with the content of the draft opinion, they are furious over the leak. Texas Senator Ted Cruz claims the Supreme Court leak is the doing of an individual 'woke left-wing twit' and claims the person responsible for the chaos unleashed in America on Monday evening should be disbarred and put in jail. 'In over 200 years of our nation's history, that has never happened,' he told Fox Primetime host Brian Kilmeade on Wednesday. 'And there was one woke little left-wing twit who decided, to hell with his or her obligations to the justice they work for, to hell with their obligations to the court, to hell with their obligations to the rule of law, that they would instead try to sneak it out in order to put political pressure on the justices and intimidate them into changing their votes,' he added. Cruz, after graduating from Harvard Law School in 1995, clerked for Judge J. Michael Luttig of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and then for the Supreme Court's Chief Justice at the time William Rehnquist from 1996 to 1997. He told Fox News on Wednesday that it's 'difficult to overstate how destructive this is to the Supreme Court.' Trump administration Attorney General Bill Barr on Wednesday called the act of leaking a bombshell Supreme Court memo an 'unforgivable sin.' Republicans argue that the leak has destroyed the sanctity of the Supreme Court, which for most of its history has remained free of political influence and partisan bickering that is more common in the executive and legislative branches. 'We're going to find this person, and when they're found, they're going to be fired on the spot, they will be disbarred if they're a member of the bar, or they will never be admitted to the bar to be a lawyer, and to the extent that they've broken criminal laws, they need to be prosecuted and sent to jail,' Cruz said. Cruz thinks that the leak came from one of the four clerks for each justice. 'I think the chances are zero that it is a justice,' Cruz said. 'I cannot believe any justice would be [party] to such a grave betrayal of the institution.' 'I think it is a law clerk, and I think it is very likely a law clerk for one of the three liberal justices. That means there are 12 likely suspects,' he added. The draft opinion showed five of the six conservative justices in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade - with only Roberts breaking from his colleagues to join the three liberals on the bench in the dissent. The draft signed by Justice Alito said 'Roe was egregiously wrong from the start.' 'Last night's stunning breach was an attack on the independence of the Supreme Court ,' Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said in a Tuesday statement calling for the leaker to be brought to justice. 'By every indication, this was yet another escalation in the radical left's ongoing campaign to bully and intimidate federal judges and substitute mob rule for the rule of law.' When speaking at a press conference on Capitol Hill, McConnell slammed the press for focusing their coverage on the contents of the leaked draft opinion and not the astounding and unprecedented fact that a Supreme Court document was leaked in general. 'I think the story today is an effort by someone on the inside to discredit the institution of the Senate, which continues a pattern that we've observed over the last several years,' the leader explained. He then listed examples of the increased pressure from Democrats to politicize the Supreme Court: '[Democratic] Leader Schumer over on the steps of the Supreme Court calling out justices by name. Sheldon Whitehouse and others calling amicus briefs, threatening the court, efforts to pack the court, efforts to have term limits on court justices.' 'What's unique about today,' McConnell continues, 'is this is the first time that we've had someone on the inside try to attack the institution.' He reminded the press, 'You need - it seems to me, excuse the lecture - to concentrate on what the news is today. Not a leaked draft, but the fact that the draft was leaked.' Democrats, on the other hand, are not worried about the breakdown of usual Supreme Court practice or catching the leaker and instead are calling for codification of Roe v. Wade. The 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case resulted in a decision that made abortion a federal protected constitutional right. In recent years, red states have tried to chip away at that rule by limiting abortion rights to time periods in which a woman may not even be aware that she is pregnant. President Joe Biden vowed to protect women's rights to an abortion should the decades-old ruling be overturned. Vice President Kamala Harris furiously lashed out at Republicans for trying to 'deny women their freedoms' in remarks Tuesday evening after a Supreme Court leak showed a conservative draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade. In her first appearance after testing positive for COVID-19 last month, Harris was ironically speaking to gala attendees for EMILY's List - a political action committee that aims to get Democratic female candidates election who are favor of advancing abortion rights. Her remarks came 24 hours after the Supreme Court leak. 'Roe v. Wade in its power has protected a woman's right, her right, to make decisions about her own body for nearly half a century,' Harris said to the room of progressives Tuesday evening. 'If the court overturns Roe v. Wade, it will be a direct assault on freedom, on the fundamental right of self-determination to which we are all entitled as Americans.' 'Those Republican leaders who are trying to weaponize the use of the law against women. Well we say, how dare they?' Harris told the cheering crowd. 'How dare they tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her own body? How dare they? How dare they try to stop her from determining her own future? How dare they try to deny women their rights and their freedoms?' 'It has never been more clear which party wants to expand our rights, and which party wants to restrict them,' Harris continued, vowing Democrats are 'not going back.' She laid out for voters a choice in the 2022 midterm elections between two very differing views on abortion. If Roe v. Wade were overturned by the 6-3 conservative majority Supreme Court the decision on lawmaking surrounding abortion would go to the states - meaning more liberal states would likely see less of an impact than red states where lawmakers and constituents push for a full ban. A Politico/Morning Consult poll taken in the day following the leak showed that 50 percent of Ameircans do not want Roe v. Wade overturned and only 28 percent want it overturned. The Supreme Court is poised to strike down the right to abortion in the United States, according to a bombshell leaked draft of a majority opinion that suggests it may be poised to overturn the famous Roe v. Wade ruling. The 98-page draft revealed by Politico calls the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision - which held that access to abortion in the US is a constitutional right - 'egregiously wrong from the start'. Abortion rights have been under threat in recent months as Republican-led states move to tighten rules - with some seeking to ban all abortions after six weeks, before many women even know they are pregnant. These include Arizona, where the Republican Governor in March signed a bill banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy; and Idaho where the governor signed a six-week abortion ban that allows family members of the foetus to sue providers who perform abortions past that point, similar to a Texas law enacted last year.  The draft was written by Justice Samuel Alito and has been circulating inside the conservative-dominated court since February. The leak of a draft opinion while a case is still pending is an extraordinary breach.   The court is expected to rule on the case before its term is up in late June or early July. Here, DailyMail.com looks at what the latest developments mean - and the history of abortion laws in the US: WHAT IS ROE V. WADE? The Roe v. Wade decision nearly 50 years ago recognised that the right to personal privacy under the US Constitution protects a woman's ability to terminate her pregnancy. On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court decided that the constitutional right to privacy applied to abortion. Roe was 'Jane Roe,' a pseudonym for Norma McCorvey, a single mother pregnant for the third time, who wanted an abortion. She sued the Dallas attorney general Henry Wade over a Texas law that made it a crime to terminate a pregnancy except in cases of rape or incest, or when the mother's life was in danger. Roe's lawyers said she was unable to travel out of the state to obtain an abortion and argued that the law was too vague and infringed on her constitutional rights. Filing a complaint alongside her was Texas doctor James Hallford, who argued the law's medical provision was vague, and that he was unable to reliably determine which of his patients fell into the allowed category. The 'Does', another couple who were childless, also filed a companion complaint, saying that medical risks made it unsafe but not life-threatening for the wife to carry a pregnancy to term, and arguing they should be able to obtain a safe, legal abortion should she become pregnant. The trio of complaints - from a woman who wanted an abortion, a doctor who wanted to perform them and a non-pregnant woman who wanted the right if the need arose - ultimately reached the nation's top court. The court heard arguments twice, and then waited until after Republican president Richard Nixon's re-election, in November 1972. Only the following January did it offer its historic seven-to-two decision - overturning the Texas laws and setting a legal precedent that has had ramifications in all 50 states. WHAT HAS THE SUPREME COURT DECIDED NOW? The Supreme Court has not decided anything yet, but a draft opinion reportedly circulated among court justices suggests that it may be poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. A document labelled 'Opinion of the Court' shows a majority of the court's justices earlier this year threw support behind overturning the 1973 case that legalised abortion across the country. According to Politico - who published the 'leaked document' - the draft opinion shows the court voted to strike down the landmark case. However, it is unclear if the draft represents the court's final word on the matter. The paper was labelled '1st Draft' of the 'Opinion of the Court' and was said to be referring to a case challenging Mississippi's ban on abortion after 15 weeks - a case known as Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organisation. The Supreme Court has yet to issue a ruling in the case, and opinions - and even justices' votes - have been known to change during the drafting process.  The court is expected to rule on the case before its term is up in late June or early July. The draft is signed by Justice Samuel Alito, a member of the court's 6-3 conservative majority, who was appointed by former President George W Bush.  'Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,' the draft opinion states. It in effect states there is no constitutional right to abortion services and would allow individual states to more heavily regulate or outright ban the procedure. HAVE THERE BEEN OTHER RULINGS SINCE 1973? On the same day as the Roe v. Wade decision, the justices also ruled in the separate 'Doe v. Bolton' case, which authorised each state to add restrictions to abortion rights for later-term pregnancies. The constitutional right to abortion was later confirmed in a number of decisions, including 'Webster v. Reproductive Health Services' in 1989 and 'Planned Parenthood v. Casey' in 1992. In the latter, the court guaranteed a woman's right to an abortion until the foetus is viable outside the womb, which is typically around 22 to 24 weeks of gestation. The Planned Parenthood v Casey ruling also affirmed Roe's finding of a constitutional right to abortion services, but allowed states to place some constraints on the practice.  WHICH STATES COULD MAKE ABORTION ILLEGAL IF ROE V. WADE IS OVERTURNED? If Roe is overturned, abortion is likely to remain legal in liberal states. More than a dozen states currently have laws protecting abortion rights.  Numerous Republican-led states have passed various abortion restrictions in defiance of the Roe precedent in recent years. Republicans could try to enact a nationwide abortion ban, while Democrats could also seek to protect abortion rights at the national level. Twenty-six states are certain or likely to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, according to the pro-abortion rights think tank the Guttmacher Institute. Of those, 22 states already have total or near-total bans on the books that are currently blocked by Roe, aside from Texas.= The state's law banning it after six weeks has already been allowed to go into effect by the Supreme Court due to its unusual civil enforcement structure. Four more states are considered likely to quickly pass bans if Roe is overturned. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia, meanwhile, have protected access to abortion in state law. This year, anticipating a decision overturning or gutting Roe, eight conservative states have already moved to restrict abortion rights. Oklahoma, for example, passed several bills in recent weeks, including one that goes into effect this summer making it a felony to perform an abortion. CAN WOMEN GET AN ABORTION IN A DIFFERENT STATE? Yes - the variation in abortion laws around America already means that some women have to travel to a different state to access a procedure. For example in Texas - which has passed a law banning almost all abortions in the state - an average of 1,400 women from the state travelling each month between September and December 2021 and sought out procedures at 34 facilities in other states such as Louisiana and Kansas. Research by the University of Texas established that more than a quarter of Texans seeking an abortion (27 per cent) went to obtain the procedure in New Mexico, a state which has seven facilities.  WHAT WOULD ROE V. WADE BEING OVERTURNED MEAN FOR WOMEN? Abortion would not become illegal everywhere in the US if Roe v. Wade is overturned, with individual states still able to choose whether and when they would be permitted.  As it stands, abortion is legal in every state - but with varying restrictions. Abortion would likely become illegal in about half of the states in the US if the ruling is overturned - with 24 states expected to ban abortion if they are able to do so. These are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin.",
    "20e89daa73d780734ac2dceb309cf2beae5751ac1ee7c20a9650cc83": "Wall Street closed sharply lower on Thursday, as investor sentiment cratered in the face of concerns that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike would not be enough to tame soaring inflation. At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial average was down 1,093 points, or 3.12 percent, it its biggest one-day point drop since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The S&P 500 was down 3.56 percent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq led the day's losses, plunging 4.99 percent. The brutal selloff erased gains from a day earlier, when markets rallied after the Federal Reserve signaled that it would not consider future interest rate hikes of more than half a percentage point. On Thursday morning, however, new inflationary signals turned markets pessimistic, and suggested that Fed Chair Jerome Powell's gradual rate hike path may not be enough to control inflation. 'Chairman Powell and the Fed's ability to orchestrate a soft landing was somewhat called into question this morning once the market saw another example of the high inflationary pressures that we're dealing with,' said Jim Barnes, director of fixed income at Bryn Mawr Trust in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.  A report on Thursday morning showed that US worker productivity fell at its steepest pace since 1947 in the first quarter, while growth in unit labor costs accelerated, a sign that rising wages will continue to spur high inflation. In another inflation warning sign, crude oil prices touched their highest level since March, hitting $111 per barrel, as the European Union laid out plans to ban Russian oil imports. The sharp reversal in markets follows a rally after Federal Reserve's decision Wednesday to raise its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point as it tries to tackle persistently high inflation.  The central bank also reassured investors that it wasn't considering even bigger rate hikes in the coming months, sending the Dow soaring 900 points by the closing bell on Wednesday. However on Thursday, sentiment appeared to shift, and markets were dominated by fears that the Fed's gradual rate hikes would be insufficient to tame soaring inflation.  The consumer price index hit 8.5 percent in March from a year ago, and new inflation data from April is due out next week.  Technology companies had some of the biggest losses and weighed down the broader market, in a reversal from the solid gains they made a day earlier. Apple fell 3.4 percent and Microsoft fell 3.9 percent. Internet retail giant Amazon slumped 6.4 percent and Google's parent company fell 4.3 percent. Energy stocks held up better than the rest of the market as U.S. crude oil prices rose 1.4 percent.  Energy markets remain volatile as the conflict in Ukraine continues and demand remains high amid tight supplies of oil.  European governments are trying to replace energy supplies from Russia and are considering an embargo.  OPEC and allied oil-producing countries decided Thursday to gradually increase the flows of crude they send to the world, easing pressure on oil prices. Higher oil and gas prices have been contributing to the uncertainties weighing on investors as they try to assess how inflation will ultimately impact businesses, consumer activity and overall economic growth. After drifting off the record highs reached in March, US gasoline prices have been creeping steadily higher in recent weeks as the summer travel season approaches. On Thursday the national average price of a gallon of regular gas was $4.25, up 11 cents from a week ago, according to the AAA Gas Price Index.  'As long as the supply remains tight, it will be hard for crude oil prices to fall and consumers will in turn face higher prices at the pump,' said Andrew Gross, AAA spokesperson.  'It now costs drivers in the U.S. about $23 more to fill up than a year ago,' he added.  Higher gas prices spur inflation throughout the economy by raising the cost to transport goods, and cut into consumer spending by gobbling up a bigger percentage of workers' paychecks.  The Fed's aggressive shift to raise interest rates has investors worrying about whether it can pull off the delicate dance to slow the economy enough to halt high inflation but not so much as to cause a downturn.  The pace and size of interest rate increases is being closely scrutinized. The latest move by the Fed to raise interest rates by a half-percentage point had been widely expected.  Markets steadied this week ahead of the policy update, but Wall Street was fearful the Fed might elect to raise rates by three-quarters of a percentage point in the months ahead.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell eased those concerns, saying the central bank is 'not actively considering' such an increase. The central bank also announced that it will start reducing its huge $9 trillion balance sheet, which consists mainly of Treasury and mortgage bonds, starting June 1. The Bank of England on Thursday raised its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 13 years, its fourth rate hike since December, as U.K. inflation runs at 30-year highs. The latest corporate earnings reports are also being closely watched by investors trying to get a better picture of inflation's impact on the economy.

Built in 1917 and recognized as a landmark by Chicago's Historic Preservation Society, the astonishing 11,600-square-feet real-estate gem is filled with history beyond its walls.  Famously known as Adler on The Park, the home located at 2700 N in the Windy City's Lincoln Park neighborhood was transformed into two luxury condominiums listed at $7.65 million and $5.65 million.  The nine-bedroom, five-bathroom combined estate boasts the best of both worlds with its singular high-class amenities of the past while maintaining all the luxury and state-of-the-art finishes.  The breathtaking house was commissioned by Emily Ryerson, a highly influential artist who survived the Titanic sinking in 1912 along with three of her children. Her husband, Arthur Ryerson, sadly passed away after heroically refusing to take a place in a lifeboat until all of the women and children were saved.  The gorgeous residence is open for public tours every weekend through the end of May for just $65, as part of the Adler on the park showcase.  The proceeds will go to The Shoulders Fund and Threshold charities, which provide assistance to vulnerable children adults with mental illnesses.  'Unit one is a lot more historic. We have a lot of original molding, original staircase, original stairs,' investor Leigh-Anne Kazma, who in behind the Adler on the Park Showcase House for Charity, told local station WGN9. 'Unit two is a little more contemporary.' Architects Henry Corwith Dangler and David Adler built the historic home between 1915 and 1917 as part of a four-home project overlooking the northern end of Lincoln Park.  The property was renovated into two luxury condominiums but maintains its original charm.  According to its listing by luxury real estate agency Baird & Warner, the first residence, listed for $7.6million, features awe-inspiring interiors and amenities including a large grand foyer, checkered floors, restored columns and majestic staircases reminiscent of the past.  The first floor boasts a three-car garage, two mudrooms, and a large family room. The second and third floors, which can be accessed by elevator, offer stunning views of the lake and park scenery.  The condo has five bedrooms, four full bathrooms, a half bathroom and spans over 6,400 square feet. While maintaining its timeless magic, the condo has been modernized to include contemporary appliances such as a Thermador refrigerator freezer and a Bosch dishwasher. Finally, two terraces, restored moldings, fireplaces, columns, and the David Adler grand staircase make the property 'one-of-a-kind,' the listing advertises.  The second luxury four-floor apartment was listed for $5.6million and boasts four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a heated garage, custom-built white kitchen cabinetry with walnut interiors and Carrera marble countertops. Its living room features a wood-burning fireplace with custom-built marble surround and French doors that lead to a private terrace. The fourth floor includes a luxury primary suite with breathtaking views, a  private bath with double bowl vanity, water closet, steam shower, and soaking tub.  The Georgian-style residence was commissioned by Emily Ryerson three years after surviving the sinking of the Titanic. Her three children, Suzette, Emily and John also survived. The sinking was the second tragedy for the resilient family as the Ryersons steamed back on the Titanic from Europe after learning that their eldest son had been killed in a car accident outside Philadelphia. According to Chicago's Historic Preservation Society, Arthur Ryerson's body was never identified.  Emily Ryerson and her children were rescued by the RMS Carpathia and later moved to Chicago. Emily Ryerson's home was part of a commission by a creative social community for notable figures in the Chicago society of the time who planned to have their home on the corner at North Lakeview and Wrightwood avenues.  'Ryerson was described as a resilient character, for even after the two significant losses in her life she maintained an indefatigable, positive humor,' a landmark designation report reads.  'She would find company among the artists, designers, and architects of her children's generation and become the social leader of the Lakeview Row Houses from her corner home at 2700.' During World War I, Ryerson turned her large house into a home for the sick and arranged hospital beds for children in her living room.  Ryerson married for a second time in 1927, after meeting financial advisor Forsythe Sherfesse while touring China.  The couple sold the impressive estate in 1930 and moved to New York. Ryerson died in 1939 aged 66. ",
    "48b30790a4b42fbcb17d38825a0cffe4b7dd8edf2fa701d15de3b512": "Dave Chappelle expressed his gratitude to friends who 'beat up' an armed man who tried to attack the comic during his Hollywood Bowl show Tuesday, audio obtained by DailyMail.com reveals.  In the audio, recorded at an afterparty, Chappelle can be heard saying that he 'felt good' when a friend broke his 23-year-old attacker Isaiah Lee's arm.  Talking about the Tuesday scare, which could have proven fatal as Lee was carrying a replica gun with a knife attached to it, Chappelle joked in his on-brand lighthearted nature. 'I felt good. My friends broke his arm. I felt good. how bad does a n***** have to be that Joe Stewart would stomp him!' [inaudible] 'I'm very proud of [inaudible],' Chappelle says.  Lee attacked Chappelle onstage during the 'Netflix Is A Joke' Festival. He was later subdued by security, and according to Chappelle's afterparty audio, friends of the comedian who were also onstage.  At the time of the attack, Chappelle was thanking earlier guests Chris Rock, Leslie Jones and Jon Stewart, who Chappelle references in the audio.  It is unclear whether Stewart actually participated in taking Lee down, or Chappelle was merely using his humour to deflect from the unsettling experience.   A grateful Chappelle credited his friends for Lee's badly injured arm said that 'killing that n**** would have been stupid.' 'I couldn't believe that they were my friends because it's is good and what they do get out.  It's all a luminary right now, you should listen,' he said. 'Those are very powerful friends and I'm sharing [this night] with people I love very much.' Chappelle's attack comes as comedians have become increasingly worried by recent reports of attacks on performing comics in the aftermath of Will Smith's infamous slap to Chris Rock during the 94th Academy Awards.  Comedy club owners are concerned that the highly publicized Oscars incident has made performers easy targets. 'It's a sad, sad thing happening right now,' Laugh Factory owner Jamie Masada Masada, told Fox News Digital.  'People are going on the stage just trying to make a name for themselves ... And I think what Will Smith did actually encouraged the violence and that's a horrible thing.' Comedian Tehran Von Ghasri, who performs at the Laugh Factory and saw Lee's attack unfold during Chappelle's show in the VIP section, echoed Masada's feelings. 'I don't think the security had time. I expressed, ''At least keep your eye on them,'' to which, to be honest, the security dismissed my concern,' Ghasri claimed.  The owner of Stand Up New York comedy club, Dani Zoldan also agreed that many comics do not feel safe in the fallout of Smith's slap.  'I feel like there was an invisible fence around comedians, right? People just didn't breach the invisible fence. Comedians can make jokes whether they were offensive or not. People didn't attack the stage,' Zoldan also told Fox.   'They were always heckling and actions were taken by clubs when people heckled - they would be given a warning, they would be thrown out of the club. But never did we see before what happened at the Oscars ... That was just insane.'  On Wednesday, Chappelle broke his silence on being attacked during his Hollywood Bowl show, saying that he 'refuses' to let it overshadow his show and that he is working with the police to bring his attacker to justice.  The comedian released a statement on Wednesday afternoon to say the incident on Tuesday night was 'unfortunate' but not what he wanted to remember from the event.  'Dave Chappelle celebrated four nights of comedy and music, setting record-breaking sales for a comedian at the Hollywood Bowl... he refuses to allow last night's incident to overshadow the magic of this historic moment,' a spokesperson said. 'As unfortunate and unsettling as the incident was, Chappelle went on with the show.' After Isaiah Lee, 23, attacked him on stage, Chappelle joked: 'It was a trans man'.  He had been talking about having to beef up his security in the wake of sparking controversy with his comments about trans people last year when Lee stormed the stage.   Despite the fact someone had just tried to attack him with a knife, critics are now accusing Chappelle of transphobia again for making the joke.  It remains unconfirmed what Lee's motives were.  His brother told Rolling Stone that he has mental health problems and has some connection to the trans community, but it's not clear what that is.  Lee was then tackled by security guards who appeared to break his arm in the melee. He is described as weighing 140lbs and is 5ft 11.  It raises questions about security at the Netflix show, its first ever live comedy festival, which forced fans to put their phones away but failed to spot the weapon.  In a statement, the company declined to say what kind of security was in place at the venue.  A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'We care deeply about the safety of creators and we strongly defend the right of stand-up comedians to perform on stage without fear of violence.'  The Hollywood Bowl wouldn't comment on security measures either.  'The safety of our artists, visitors and staff is the LA Phil's top priority. The incident that occurred at the Hollywood Bowl on May 3, 2022 remains an active investigation, and we are unable to comment further at this time. Please refer additional questions to the LAPD,' a spokesman said.  The venue said on its website that the show, which last night was titled Dave Chappelle and Friends, would be a 'phone-free experience' and that the audience would have to secure their phones inside pouches.  After the attacker was detained, Chappelle thanked Foxx on stage during the curtain call. He said: 'Shout out to Jamie Foxx by the way.  'Whenever you're in trouble, Jamie Foxx will show up in a sheriff's hat.'  Foxx replied: 'I thought that was part of the show, I didn't know what the f***...' Chappelle said: 'I grabbed the back of that n**** head. His hair was spongy. Absorbent.' Foxx added: 'Listen, I just want to say, this man is an absolute genius. We've got to make sure we protect him at all times. 'For every comedian who comes out here, this means everything. You're a genius. You're a legend, I enjoyed myself thoroughly, and we're not going to let nothing happen to you.' Chappelle said: 'I've been doing this for 35 years. I just stomped a n**** backstage. I've always wanted to do that.' After the attack, Jimmy Carr shared a selfie taken with the fellow comedian and described his Los Angeles show as 'crazy'. He tweeted: 'The Hollywood Bowl show with the legendary Dave Chappelle was crazy. Just happy everyone's ok.' Chappelle came under fire last year over jokes about trans people in his Netflix comedy show The Closer. During the controversial special, he made one comment stating that 'gender is a fact', prompting Netflix staff to protest and mass outrage on social media against some of his jokes. He also shared his backing for JK Rowling, who has also attracted criticism for her remarks about biological sex. In the special, he stated that he does not hate transgender people, and tells a long anecdote about a trans woman comic, who he describes as a friend, who came to his defense in earlier entanglements with the community. Chappelle added: 'Every human being in this room, every human being on Earth, had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on Earth. That is a fact.' In the contentious special, Chappelle also joked that women today view transwomen the same way black people might view white women wearing blackface, and remarked that women are entitled to feel anger toward transwomen, since Caitlyn Jenner won Glamour magazine's 2015 Woman of the Year award. 'I'd be mad as sh*t if I was a woman,' Chappelle said. The star also joked about the anatomy of transwomen, joking that they lacked real female reproductive organs and that they did not have blood but 'beet juice'. The comments prompted calls for Netflix to take down the show, but boss Ted Sarandos told staff that 'content on screen doesn't translate to real-world harm'.  Those who have criticized Chapelle's jokes have specifically cited the physical danger faced by the trans community as a result of anti-trans ideology.  The attack comes weeks after Will Smith attacked Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, raising fears it would inspire similar violent protests against performers.  The actor slapped the comedian on stage after a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett-Smith's shaved head. Pinkett-Smith has been open in the past about her struggles with alopecia. After the slap, Smith returned to his seat and screamed 'keep my wife's name out of your f*****g mouth.' He the then won the Oscar for Best Actor in his role as Richard Williams, in the film King Richard. He used his speech to apologize to the Academy and he later posted an apology on Instagram. Rock has mostly kept quiet on the issue, speaking out only to say he was 'processing' what happened. The incident prompted members of the comedy community, including Jack Whitehall and Kathy Griffin, to voice their fears that performers are no longer safe on stage.  The Netflix event is the streaming giant's first ever comedy festival and features performances from big name stars including Seth Rogen, Snoop Dogg, Bill Burr and Pete Davidson."
