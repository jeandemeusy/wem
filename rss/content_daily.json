{"184d097373945bae8a8f071a0e890abc466582dfab93a181e1a27224": "A Cambridge academic has suggested that privately educated white boys are being disadvantaged in the Oxbridge university admissions process due to 'culture wars' over 'privilege'. David Abulafia, a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, has suggested that to combat the 'disapproval' of white, male candidates, school names should be removed from the application. He said that by listing their private school, students are penalised 'for their parent's choice' -- and 'betrays' principles on which Cambridge has 'flourished'. The emeritus professor of Mediterranean history at the University of Cambridge said that between 2014 and 2021, Eton's admissions to Oxbridge halved, puzzling its leaders. Writing in The Spectator, Professor Abulafia said: 'It is vital to remember that admitting students is all about individuals. 'University admissions have become another site for culture wars in which 'white', 'male' and 'privileged' are terms of disapproval, linked together to justify injustice.' The Professor argued that 'imagined class' should not determine whether an applicant is granted a place, and suggested removing school names from applications.  He claimed that 'the really disadvantaged candidates are arguably the white males from outstanding independent schools' and said that the often go to Russell Group universities instead, such as Bristol, Durham and St Andrews. Last week, Stephen Toope, vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, told The Times: 'We have to make it very, very clear we are intending to reduce over time the number of people who are coming from independent school backgrounds into places like Oxford or Cambridge'.  Professor Abulafia said that choosing state school applicants over 'well-qualified competitors from private schools' has become more 'obvious' in the last few years, but has been happening for a long time.  Targets for state school admissions is now around 75 per cent, with Professor Abulafia stating that state school entry will rise as expected as more students match the performance of their privately-educated counterparts.  However he claimed that there is some level of 'positive discrimination' towards state-educated applicants, and 'negative discrimination' towards privately taught students.

The Queen led praise for the 40-year-old BBC podcaster, saying she was 'pleased' to approve the damehood, while the Prime Minister said 'if ever an honour was richly deserved, this is it'. The former headteacher was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2016 and has kept her more than 500,000 Instagram followers up to date with her treatments. She has now raised more than PS3.8 million with her Bowelbabe Fund for Cancer Research UK. On Thursday night, Number 10 confirmed that James is to be made a dame, saying: 'The Queen has been pleased to approve that the honour of damehood be conferred upon Deborah James.' Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: 'If ever an honour was richly deserved, this is it. Deborah has been an inspiration and her honesty, warmth and courage has been a source of strength to so many people. 'Through her tireless campaigning and by so openly sharing her experience she has not only helped in our fight against this terrible disease, she has ensured countless others with the Big C have not felt alone.  'I hope this recognition from Her Majesty - backed I'm sure by the whole country - will provide some comfort to Deborah and her family at this difficult time. My thoughts are with them and Deborah should know she has the country's love and gratitude.' She has now revealed her shock at being made a Dame, telling The Sun: 'I don't know what to say. I'm blown away and feel incredibly honoured. I don't feel like I deserve this. I can't tell you what this means to my family, it's so much to take in.' Ms James said that she would love for the fundraiser to reach PS5 million by the weekend.  Dame Deborah's children Hugo and Eloise said they were 'speechless' and 'so, so proud', while husband Seb said a damehood was 'something that she would never have dreamt of but it is so truly deserved'. Damehoods and knighthoods are usually listed in the New Year or Queen's Birthday Honours, but in exceptional circumstances some are announced at other times. The teacher-turned-podcaster has moved millions as she announced in a heartbreaking message that active treatment for her bowel cancer was stopping and that she was moving to hospice at home care to die. The mother-of two is preparing to spend her final hours on her parents' lawn surrounded by family, drinking Champagne, having been told by her hospice nurses: 'You are dying, you can drink what you like.' In a tearful final newspaper interview she said last night: 'The one thing my family know is I am petrified of being alone. I don't want to die alone.' And when asked about the end of her life approaching she said: 'I have moments when I just sob uncontrollably, but I can't spend my last few days crying, it would be such a waste. So I'm trying to compartmentalise my death'. She said she has started her 'to-do death list' to support son Hugo, 14, and daughter, Eloise, 12, when she is gone, and has urged her husband Sebastien to find love, with the caveat: 'Don't be taken for a ride, don't marry a bimbo'.  Dame Deborah said she has written letters for her children to help them with their first dates and wedding days, and will buy Hugo 'a nice pen or wallet or cufflinks' and Eloise 'Tiffany bracelets and earrings' to remember her - as well as some presents and postcards from her for the future. Her funeral is also planned where she will be cremated, but she hopes her ashes will be kept in the family kitchen 'for a while' before being scattered.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also paid tribute to the cancer-stricken BBC podcaster, declaring that she has 'captured the heart of the nation', after her fundraiser passed PS3.3million yesterday and continues to rise at a rate of PS1million every 24 hours.  Steve Bland, co-host of the You, Me And The Big C podcast alongside Deborah James, praised the bowel cancer campaigner after her research fundraising initiative reached PS4 million. Appearing on BBC Breakfast, he said: 'It is amazing, but this is what Deborah does. Deborah deals in the extraordinary. This is what she has done for five years. 'Everyone is focusing on the last five days, but actually Deb has been doing this for five years, ever since she was diagnosed with incurable cancer five years ago, and since then she has just been trying to help people. 'She has been banging the drum over and over and over and over - on bowel cancer symptoms, working hard to get drugs approved that she knew would help her but help loads of other people too. 'While the last five days have been amazing - the PS4 million is incredible - there are people all over the country walking around enjoying their children's birthday parties because she has basically saved their lives.' Bland said James had messaged him to say she would be watching the interview from her parents' home in Woking, Surrey, where she is receiving end-of-life care. He added: 'I don't know what target she will have in her mind now. Five, I guess.' In the heartbreaking interview with The Times, Deborah also revealed how she will record letters for her children to open after she's died, including advice for them on how to act on a first date or what to do on their wedding day. Ms James said she's been in hospital for months, but since undergoing hospice care, she has been planning her last hours on the lawn with her family and drinking champagne, as staff joked with her: 'You are dying, you can drink what you like.' The nation has been moved by her tragic story in recent days, with at least PS1million in donations now being made every day to her Bowelbabe Fund for Cancer Research UK page, which she set up. Ms James earlier spoke of wanting to die at her parents' house in Woking, to spare son, Hugo, 14, and daughter, Eloise, 12, from constant reminders in their London home, which she won't visit again because of the stairs. She said: 'I can't use my legs any more and I'm incredibly weak... my husband must lift me for everything'. She explained how she'd had to break the news to the children, but put her full faith in husband Sebastien Bowen - a London banker she married back in 2008. The couple briefly split up seven years later and began divorce proceedings, but soon got back together after agreeing to counselling to be on better terms for their children. Speaking to The Times she revealed she has issued him with 'strict instructions' to her 'incredible' husband Sebastien Bowen to find love again after her death.  'It's been hideous telling my children. My husband Sebastien has been incredible, he has dropped everything and is with me 24/7. My first thought was [that] I don't want my children to see me like this. I didn't think I would be able to speak to them without crying, but I'd love one last cuddle with them. 'We have had a string of emotional conversations that have escalated very quickly from supportive care to end-of-life care. 'My husband Sebastien has been incredible, he has dropped everything and is with me 24/7. 'My first thought was [that] I don't want my children to see me like this. I didn't think I would be able to speak to them without crying, but I'd love one last cuddle with them.' On Monday, Miss James, announced that despite having 17 tumours removed and undergoing new procedures she has been moved to hospice care because her 'body simply isn't playing ball'. 'The message I never wanted to write. We have tried everything, but my body simply isn't playing ball. My active care has stopped and I am now moved to hospice at home care, with my incredible family all around me and the focus is on making sure I'm not in pain and spending time with them.  'Nobody knows how long I've got left but I'm not able to walk, I'm sleeping most of the days, and most things I took for granted are pipe dreams. I know we have left no stone unturned. But even with all the innovative cancer drugs in the world or some magic new breakthrough, my body just can't continue anymore. 'In over 5 years of writing about how I thought it would be my final Christmas, how I wouldn't see my 40th birthday nor see my kids go to secondary school - I never envisaged writing the one where I would actually say goodbye. 'I think it's been the rebellious hope in me. 'But I don't think anyone can say the last 6 months has exactly been kind! It's all heartbreaking to be going through but I'm surrounded by so much love that if anything can help me through I hope that will. 'Bowelbabe Fund 'I always knew there was one thing I always wanted to do before I died. I have always over the years raised as much awareness and money for the charities that are closest to me. @cr_uk @royalmarsden @bowelcanceruk 'As a result, the @bowelbabefund is being established and I'd love nothing more than for you to help it flourish. Please visit bowelbabe.org for all the info and to donate (link in Bio). 'All I ask if you ever read a column, followed my Instagram, listened to the podcast or saw me dressed as a poo for no reason. Please buy me a drink to see me out this world, by donating the cost to @bowelbabefund which will enable us to raise funds for further life saving research into cancer. To give more Deborah's more time! 'Right now for me it's all about taking it a day at a time, step by step and being grateful for another sunrise. My whole family are around me and we will dance through this together, sunbathing and laughing (I'll cry!!) at every possible moment! 'You are all incredible, thank you for playing your part in my journey. No regrets. 'Enjoy life x Deborah' She said she is now trying to 'compartmentalise' her death so that she can focus on her 'to-do death list' which includes making memory boxes and recording letters and 'funny messages' for her children. 'I know materialistic things don't matter, but I want to buy Hugo a nice pen or wallet or cufflinks,' she said. 'I'm going to buy my daughter some Tiffany bracelets and earrings. 'They will have all the memories, but I want them to have a few presents in the future. I also want to write them postcards, but I have to be honest, I get really tired.' She added: 'At 12 and 14 I hope they will remember me, but [they are] still very young, so my image will fade and they will have to rely on videos or photos.' She has also imparted instructions for her husband, whom she married in 2008. 'I want him to move on,' she said. 'He's a handsome man, I'm, like, 'Don't be taken for a ride, don't marry a bimbo, find someone else who can make you laugh like we did [together].' Miss James has moved to her parents bungalow in Woking as she is no longer able to use the stairs in her townhouse in Barnes, south west London because 'cancer is eating me up'. She said she wants 'to die listening to my family,' adding: 'I just want to hear their banter and the normal buzz of life as I go.' She has planned her funeral to ease the 'burden' on her loved ones and would like to be cremated. 'I'm the kind of person that wouldn't mind staying in the top drawer in the kitchen for a while,' she said. In a tweet on Wednesday, William and Kate said: 'Every now and then, someone captures the heart of the nation with their zest for life & tenacious desire to give back to society. 'Bowelbabe is one of those special people. Her tireless efforts to raise awareness of bowel cancer & end the stigma of treatment are inspiring. 'We are so sad to hear her recent update but pleased to support the Bowelbabe Fund, which will benefit the The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust among others.  'Deborah, our thoughts are with you, your family and your friends. Thank you for giving hope to so many who are living with cancer. W & C.'  That evening, the managing director of The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, Antonia Dalmahoy, thanked all of those who have donated.  'The national outpouring of love and support for Deborah and her Bowel Babe Fund has been absolutely phenomenal and has really lifted her spirits,' she said. 'We'd like to thank everyone who has donated to the Fund, for The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, Cancer Research UK and Bowel Cancer UK. This sum of money will make a huge difference to people with cancer and create a lasting legacy for Deborah.'  It came after she said she is is preparing to 'surrender to the inevitable' and is in end-of-life hospice care surrounded by her family, in a heartfelt 'final' newspaper column. Ms James wrote that her body had been left 'emaciated' by five years of battling bowel cancer.  Charities and organisations set to benefit from the fundraising have lined up to thank her for her efforts. Michelle Mitchell, chief executive at Cancer Research UK said: 'Since being diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2016, Deborah James has shown an incredible commitment to campaigning, fundraising and raising awareness of cancer. 'Even in this most challenging time, her determination to raise money and awareness is inspiring and we're honoured to be supporting Deborah and her family in establishing the Bowelbabe Fund. 'This fund will raise awareness of cancer alongside funds for clinical trials and research into personalised medicine, with the aim of creating new and kinder treatments for cancer patients and giving them more time with their loved ones. 'The fund will support the work of Cancer Research UK and those causes she and her family are passionate about, for example Bowel Cancer UK, The Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden. 'We've been overwhelmed by the support for the Bowelbabe Fund so far, massively exceeding its target within hours. It's a true testament to how many people's lives Deborah has touched with her honesty, humour and compassion.' A spokesperson from The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity added: 'Deborah is an absolute inspiration to so many people with cancer, and a passionate supporter of The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. It's typically selfless of her to spend what precious time she has left fundraising for us, Cancer Research UK and Bowel Cancer UK. 'The Bowel Babe Fund will, as Deborah has set out, help fund clinical trials and research into personalised medicine for cancer patients and supporting campaigns to raise awareness of bowel cancer. This may include developing new drugs, and new ways of diagnosing cancer at an earlier stage. 'As well as this fundraising legacy, Deborah's work over the last five years to raise awareness of the symptoms of bowel cancer and the importance of early diagnosis in improving survival, will have saved and extended countless lives.' Ms James had earlier spoken of her connection with her family to the BBC, saying they were 'really loving' and that she 'adored' them. Ms James told the BBC: 'I have a really loving family who I adore. Honestly, they're incredible and all I knew I wanted was to come here and be able to relax knowing that everything was okay. 'I've had some really hard conversations during the last week. You think, 'Gosh, how can anyone have those conversations?' and then you find yourself in the middle of them. 'And people are very nice, but you're talking about your own death and I've had five years to prepare for my death.' The interviewer told the mother-of-two, 'I know it's not easy', as she struggled to speak around her tears, to which he eventually replied: 'It's hard. It's really hard. 'The thing that I know, because I trust my husband - he's just the most wonderful man and so is my family, and I know that my kids are going to be more than looked after and surrounded by love. 'You always want to know as a mother - are your kids going to be okay? And my kids are going to be fine. But it doesn't mean I'm not going to miss every chance I could have had with them.' Remembering her former podcast co-host Rachael Bland, who died of breast cancer in 2018, Ms James told the BBC: ' I'm really scared. I don't know how she could deal with such a 'this is what I'm going to do' [approach], I'm petrified. 'I can't make a deal with the devil anymore unfortunately. I just feel gutted not to have more life, 'cos you know me, I love life so much. 'But I do hope that all of our stories and the podcast and everything we've shared over the past few years has saved lives. 'I just knew that I wanted to ensure I could leave enough money for them to do something meaningful, that would mean that we could fund projects that I myself would have benefited from 5 years ago to give me life. 'Because you just never know do you, when that next breakthrough is going to come, but I know we have the skills and passion in this country to make things happen, but we just need to fund it properly.' Ms James told host Tony Livesey how she was still making her way through a list of 'death admin' she needed to do, but the priority was remaining as comfortable as possible. 'I can't walk, I can't stand, I can't go to the loo - I can't do really basic stuff. I've been doing a lot of sleeping. Just spending time watching people that I love, to just know that they are okay. 'The more I tell myself that they are going to be okay, I know they are surrounded by love. I know they are surrounded by support - they will be fine.' Signing off tearfully in the final episode of her podcast, she told listeners: 'That's it from me, I can't believe it, which is a very sad thing to say. I'm pleased I've got to the point where I can say it. We'll see each other again, somewhere, somehow, dancing. Until then, please, please, just enjoy life because it's so precious. All I want right now is more time and more life.' She then joked: 'And check your poo. I can't leave on any other word except from check your poo.' At the start of the year, Deborah, who shares her children Hugo, 14, and Eloise, 12, with her husband Sebastien, announced she had 'nearly died' in hospital, calling it the 'hardest' part of her 5-year cancer battle, and was admitted as an in-patient earlier this month. She was told early on in her diagnosis that she might not live beyond five years -- a milestone that passed on Christmas of 2021. Writing in her Instagram post, she said: 'Nobody knows how long I've got left but I'm not able to walk, I'm sleeping most of the days, and most things I took for granted are pipe dreams. I know we have left no stone unturned. 'But even with all the innovative cancer drugs in the world or some magic new breakthrough, my body just can't continue anymore.' 'In over 5 years of writing about how I thought it would be my final Christmas, how I wouldn't see my 40th birthday nor see my kids go to secondary school - I never envisaged writing the one where I would actually say goodbye. 'I think it's been the rebellious hope in me.' Tributes to Deborah called her a 'true inspiration' and a 'force to be reckoned with' when it came to talking about bowel cancer. Her podcast co-host, Lauren Mahon, shared a lengthy tribute on Instagram, saying that hearts have been 'shattered into thousands of pieces' by Deborah's announcement and are simultaneously 'completely bursting with pride'. Ms Mahon said that she is 'not ready to accept what's happening right now' and asked for people to keep Deborah's parents, siblings and family in their 'hearts, thoughts and prayers'.  She also urged people to support the new fundraising campaign, Bowelbabe Fund, for Cancer Research UK.   Deborah's fundraising efforts, adding: 'She did it! Bowelbabe did that. Let's keep it going. Two mil anyone? Proud doesn't cut it anymore. It's awe. It has since raised more than PS3million in less than 72 hours after it was launched. It will be spent on funding clinical trials and research into personalised medicine that could result in new treatments for cancer patients, and continued support to raise awareness of cancer.  Discussing how difficult the last six months have been, James said while she was really happy that the 'big gun chemo' she endured has slowed her cancer's growth, which had been 'on the march', it had been an exhausting time.  In the summer, James was told she had an aggressive new tumour that had wrapped itself around her bile duct - requiring a life-saving stay in hospital - and a stent fitted to stop her liver from failing.  The stent fitted to stop her liver failing 'stopped working' in December.  She explained to her followers at the time how hopes at having a 'quick replacement operation' had turned into a 'nightmare'.  She said: 'I'm now at the mercy of hopefully some super 'magic medicine miracle' - but then I always have been, and any chance is a chance right?  'All I ever say Is all I want is hope and options.'   Last year, James shared that her cancer, which has been kept at bay by pioneering treatment, was back again and she was forced to endure a 12th operation. The West London mother-of-two, a deputy head, was diagnosed 'late' with incurable bowel cancer in 2016. She has frequently said that as a vegetarian runner, she was the last person doctors expected to get the disease. After sharing her experiences on living with the disease on social media, Deborah became known as the 'Bowel Babe' and began writing a column for the Sun. In 2018, Deborah joined Lauren Mahon and Rachael Bland to present the award-winning podcast You, Me and the Big C on Radio 5 Live.  Bland tragically died of breast cancer on September 5th that year; her husband Steve Bland now co-presents the show.  ", "bd8501dc42aac16832a194ccc871f7cef365bc0b8d94accec0b332a6": "Boris Johnson has ordered ministers to slash the size of the Civil Service by a fifth to free up billions for tax cuts. The Prime Minister used a 'cost of living' Cabinet meeting in the Midlands yesterday to order his top team to redouble their efforts to ease the financial pressure on struggling families. Mr Johnson told the Daily Mail: 'We have got to cut the cost of government to reduce the cost of living.'  He said the Civil Service had become 'swollen' during the pandemic and more than 90,000 jobs had to go. And he suggested the billions saved could be ploughed into tax cuts, saying: 'Every pound the Government pre-empts from the taxpayer is money they can spend on their own priorities, on their own lives.' Ministers were given one month to come up with plans to cut the size of the Civil Service by 91,000 - almost a fifth of the current total. The move would save about PS3.5 billion a year, freeing up resources to help ease the cost of living through tax cuts or other measures.   Jacob Rees-Mogg defended the move today in the face of  union anger, saying it would simply remove staff brought in to deal with Covid and the 'aftermath of Brexit'. The Brexit Opportunities Minister told Sky News: 'I know it sounds eye-catching but it's just getting back to the civil service we had in 2016... since then we've had to take on people for specific tasks.  'So dealing with the aftermath of Brexit and dealing with Covid, so there's been a reason for that increase, but we're now trying to get back to normal.'  Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union for civil and public service workers, accused the Government of 'picking a number out of the air'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that part of civil servants' jobs was to look at efficiency.  'They've already committed to 5 per cent cuts in their budgets as part of the spending review,' he said.  'That kind of ongoing efficiency is what the civil service does all the time. But if you're going to just simply pluck a figure out of the air and say it's now 90,000 because there's a convenient point in time where we liked the number, that's not a serious way to look at what does a government want to do and how can it deliver that in the most effective and efficient way.'      The PM's chief of staff, Steve Barclay, is also investigating plans to use new technology, including artificial intelligence systems, to improve efficiency at struggling agencies such as the Passport Office and DVLA. Mr Johnson said the public 'deserve better' from organisations which have allowed huge backlogs to build up.  And he remains convinced of the need to get more officials back at their desks, adding: 'We need to get back into the habit of getting into the office, getting into the workplace. 'There will be lots of people who disagree with me, but I believe people are more productive, more energetic, more full of ideas, when they are surrounded by other people.' But the PM said technology also had a major role to play in improving efficiency - and potentially cutting the cost of official documents such as passports. 'I'm not antediluvian about technology,' he said.  'Things like Zoom and Teams can increase productivity, rather than just be an excuse for people to stay at home. 'We should be asking ourselves, why does it cost so much for a passport? Often it's because the cost has been jacked up over the years to support the cost of the organisation providing them.  'What is the chief driver of those costs? Headcount. If we can do more with AI... potentially it could be cheaper.' The move will put ministers on a collision course with the powerful Civil Service unions, which are already complaining bitterly about a Government drive to persuade thousands of staff to return to their desks after the pandemic. There were fresh calls yesterday for Rishi Sunak to cut taxes after official figures showed that the economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1 per cent in March - even before the latest round of energy price hikes last month. NatWest chairman Sir Howard Davies urged ministers to focus on helping the worst-off households, pointing out that the poorest fifth of the population will have to cut their non-essential spending by 20 per cent. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson followed Chancellor Mr Sunak in saying he would look at introducing a windfall tax on the profits of energy giants to help struggling families. BP sought to head off pressure for such a levy by announcing it would reinvest all its profits from North Sea oil and gas over the next decade back into the UK. The PM's plan to reduce civil servant numbers comes at a time when ministers are grappling with the so-called Whitehall 'Blob' over a range of issues, including Brexit. A Government source said the Civil Service had become bloated during the pandemic and needed to be cut down. The source said it was right that the Government makes renewed efforts to tighten its belt in the same way that businesses and families are doing. 'All businesses are looking at ways they can reduce their costs and increase performance and government should be no different,' the source said.  'We have seen the Civil Service headcount rise by 90,000 since 2016. A lot of that was pandemic-related and it was the right thing to do at the time. 'But we are past the pandemic now and we cannot let this bigger state become the new normal - we need to get back to pre-pandemic levels. 'It will help save a substantial amount of money, freeing up resources that could be used to help people with the cost of living.' The current Civil Service headcount stands at 475,000, the highest level since 2010. Ministers have been given two years to reduce that total by 91,000.  Downing Street declined to put a figure on the estimated savings, but the average civil servant earns PS28,100, with other costs such as National Insurance and pensions adding around PS10,000 to the wage bill. Based on these figures, cutting 91,000 jobs would save about PS3.5 billion a year. Government sources said ministers would focus initially on reducing numbers through 'natural wastage', such as recruitment freezes.  But Jacob Rees-Mogg warned the Cabinet yesterday that compulsory redundancies may be needed. He said the cuts would restore the Civil Service to the size it was a decade ago, adding: 'It has been done before and it can be done again.' Mr Rees-Mogg, the minister for government efficiency, outlined the plans to the Cabinet yesterday when ministers gathered in Stoke-on-Trent to discuss ways to accelerate action on tackling the cost of living. He said that on current projections the Civil Service was due to expand over the next three years, 'despite the requirements of Brexit and the pandemic now receding'. Ministers were told that 30,000 to 40,000 civil servants leave every year, meaning major reductions could be achieved through recruitment freezes. ", "3607a5537fb9663aabeb10a910c29d7aa7fcc58eb69aeddb29149764": "News content created by British publishers generates around PS1billion in UK revenue for Google and Facebook every year, a leading academic has found. Professor Matthew Elliott from Cambridge University said both US tech giants relied on journalism to keep users engaged, which was crucial to their business models. Yet, despite helping the platforms to earn at least PS16billion every year in the UK, the media organisations that created the content received 'little, if any' compensation. Any profits generated as a result of the investment publishers put into creating first-rate journalism should go to them rather than Google and Facebook, Professor Elliott said. 'The fact that high-quality news content generates wider benefits to society makes this problem acute,' he added. Paul Zwillenberg, chief executive of the Daily Mail and General Trust, yesterday said the Daily Mail invested a lot in journalism and 'deserves to be fairly rewarded'. Speaking at the Deloitte and Enders Media and Telecoms conference 2022, he criticised the 'unfair' deal, telling the audience: 'The value of journalism in the UK - for newspapers, both regional and national, magazines, and broadcasters - is approximately PS1billion.' Not only should payment for content be fair, he said, but that it was also 'important that the rules of engagement are clear'. 'What do I mean by that? I mean algorithms that are fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory. Free from bias and self-preference.' The News Media Association, which represents UK national and regional papers, published the study. It has led to renewed calls for the Digital Markets Unit (DMU) to urgently be given the powers it needs to level the playing field between news publishers and online giants. News content is highly important for digital platforms because it keeps users engaged and provides valuable data for online advertising, the study said. Entitled the Value of News to Digital Platforms in the UK, it found around two thirds of Google search results in the UK showed up links to news articles. This can appear through direct search queries or those that appear indirectly but capture the attention of the user and help give a better answer. News content similarly benefits Facebook in keeping its users interested, which is critical to the social media giant's business. Its algorithms have been developed to maximise user engagement, which in turn enables it to sell more ads and collect more user data with which to target these ads. Google earned PS10.8billion and Facebook made PS5.3billion in the UK in 2021, according to estimates based on company reporting. But Professor Elliott said: 'They share little, if any, of these revenues with the publishers on whose news content they rely. By considering how much revenue Google and Facebook might lose if news content were to be withheld, it is estimated that the value of news to the platforms is about PS1billion a year. 'If the public is to continue to be served with high-quality news, the benefits from the investment in journalism made by news publishers should mainly accrue to them, not Google and Facebook.' The draft Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Bill was announced earlier this week in the Queen's Speech.

Tony Finn had worked for the West Yorkshire-based British Bung Company for almost 24 years when he was fired in May last year. He took them to the tribunal claiming, among other things, that he had been the victim of sex harassment following an incident with factory supervisor Jamie King. Mr Finn alleged that during a shop floor row that almost erupted in violence in July 2019, Mr King had referred to him as a 'bald c***'. Hair loss is much more prevalent among men than women so using it to describe someone is a form of discrimination, a judge found. The ruling, made by a panel of three men who in making their judgement bemoaned their own lack of hair, comes in a case between a veteran electrician and his manufacturing firm employers. It compared calling a man bald to commenting on a woman's breasts.   The tribunal heard that Mr Finn was less upset by the 'Anglo Saxon' language than the comment on his appearance. The allegation resulted in the panel - led by Judge Jonathan Brain - deliberating on whether remarking on his baldness was simply insulting or actually harassment. The panel said: 'In our judgment, there is a connection between the word ''bald'' on the one hand and the protected characteristic of sex on the other. '(The company's lawyer) was right to submit that women as well as men may be bald. However, as all three members of the Tribunal will vouchsafe, baldness is much more prevalent in men than women. 'We find it to be inherently related to sex.' As part of its ruling, the panel raised a previous tribunal case where a man was found to have sexually harassed a woman by remarking on the size of her breasts to rebut the firm's point. 'It is much more likely that a person on the receiving end of a comment such as that which was made in (that) case would be female,' the tribunal said. 'So too, it is much more likely that a person on the receiving end of a remark such as that made by Mr King would be male. 'Mr King made the remark with a view to hurting the claimant by commenting on his appearance which is often found amongst men. 'The Tribunal therefore determines that by referring to the claimant as a 'bald c***'...Mr King's conduct was unwanted, it was a violation of the claimant's dignity, it created an intimidating environment for him, it was done for that purpose, and it related to the claimant's sex.' Describing the argument with Mr King - who is 30 years his junior - Mr Finn told the tribunal, held in Sheffield, South Yorkshire: 'I was working on a machine that I had to cover awaiting specialist repair. The covers were taken off, and it was apparent that Jamie King had done this. 'When I spoke to him about it, he began to call me a stupid old bald c*** and threatened to ''deck me.'' Mr Finn said he had been left 'fearful for my personal safety'. The tribunal heard he then wrote a statement about the incident with his son Robert, who was a police officer, on official West Yorkshire Police paper. When this was handed to his bosses at the firm - a family business that makes traditional wooden cask closures for the brewing industry - they at first believed that he had reported the incident as a crime. Mr Finn told them that it was not his intention to make the statement appear like an official police document. However, the firm accused him of trying to intimidate them and fired him for misconduct. As well as upholding his sex harassment claim, the tribunal ruled the company had dismissed him unfairly because instead of waiting to hear from police after they complained about his son's involvement, which they claimed they would, they sacked him two working days later. Mr Finn won claims of unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal, being subjected to detriments and sex harassment. He lost an additional claim for age discrimination after the tribunal ruled that Mr King had not called him 'old' but simply a 'bald c***'. Mr Finn's compensation will be determined at a later date. However, any pay out will be reduced after the tribunal ruled he had contributed to his dismissal through his conduct.", "1bb35cbbfbf6c9618af65020a8675302b5b417955af70bf8f6c30f66": "Aussie children got the surprise of their lives when their grandmother turned up in their lounge room after a two-and-a-half year absence due to Covid.  Their grandmother Diane, who resides 15,000km away in England, flew to Perth - where her only grandkids live - after being prevented by Covid-19 border restrictions.  The three children were shocked and emotional after Diane appeared in a bathrobe on Wednesday morning, following a quick sleep after arriving earlier at 1am.  Footage of the kids - Gracie, 16, Sam, 13, Lily, 9 - being caught off guard emerged on Thursday after parents Stuart and Emily Halfacree kept Diane's arrival a secret. The parents had been worried the surprised would be ruined by the English grandmother being seen using the bathroom in the middle of the night. 'We woke the children up at 7AM and told them we had a surprise. Their response was so beautiful, I loved seeing them react to her being there,' Ms Halfacree said in the post uploaded to Newsflare.  The children appeared tired, slouching on the lounge, but then suddenly propped up - with faces of shock and joy - when nana appears, with Gracie screaming, 'wait, what, what are you doing here?' The kids then surrounded her with bear hugs, before the flabbergasted Gracie, staring in disbelief, erupted in tears.  Ms Halfacree said it had been a long delay with the visit, as the family had been keeping in touch through endless FaceTime.  'It was amazing to surprise our kids with a visit from their nana after so long apart,' Ms Halfacree said.  'It had been two and a half years of FaceTime calls and messages, hoping and wishing that one day the world would go back to normal and we could see each other again.' The reunion came once Western Australia's famously stringent Covid measures were relaxed.  The state had strict border restrictions in place for nearly 700 days throughout the pandemic.  Last March Premier Mark McGowan lifted the hard border, with international visitors who comply with Australia's current entry requirements once again allowed to arrive in the state.  'As soon as our premier announced we were opening to international travellers, Diane booked a flight immediately,' Ms Halfacree said.  The family moved from the UK to Perth in 2009, and hope to travel back there for Christmas.

In a high-stakes gamble earlier this week, the Labour leader said he would 'do the right thing and step down' if Durham Constabulary fined him over his lockdown beer with aides.  Durham Police has so far refused to disclose whether it will fine Mr Starmer if it finds he broke lockdown rules when he gathered with MPs and officials in Durham Miners Hall on April 30 last year. Supporters of the Opposition leader believe the force will not issue a retrospective fine after they decided against issuing a fixed penalty notice to Dominic Cummings, then chief advisor to Boris Johnson, over his trip to Barnard Castle in the county. But Durham Police appeared to take a stricter view of rule-breakers later in the pandemic when it handed a PS10,000 fine to a woman who had organised a memorial event for her father-in-law, who had died of Covid, involving a balloon release, The Times reports.  Vicky Hutchison organised the gathering on November 11, 2020, in the same field where Ian Stephenson's funeral had been due to take place in Horden. The fine was reduced to a means tested PS500 following a hearing at Peterlee Magistrates' Court on April 23 - seven days before the Labour leader was pictured with a beer. Hutchison had told friends and family to wear face masks and remain socially distanced during the gathering. Police did not attend the event and no disorder was reported, a court report from The Northern Echo said. But the force launched a retrospective probe when it received a complaint, leading to detectives analysing a live-stream video of the memorial event before issuing Hutchison with the fine. Her case inevitably raises questions over how the force is investigating the 'Beergate' gathering. Mr Starmer has denied all wrongdoing and says he and colleagues returned to work after eating, but this week insisted he would 'do the right thing and step down' if Durham Constabulary fined him. His deputy Angela Rayner has also said she would quit if fined over her role in the event. Durham police admitted that Mr Cummings may have been in breach of lockdown restrictions when he drove to Barnard Castle after testing positive for Covid. He drove his wife and son 260 miles to his parents' home on March 27 at the height of the pandemic in a scandal led to an unprecedented press conference in No10's Rose Garden.. The force decided against issuing a fine, but sources say the Labour leader may receive harsher treatment because the approach to dealing with breaches of Covid rules became tougher following the Cummings incident.  Durham police did not respond to requests for comment.

The Foreign Secretary will unveil a new overseas development strategy next week that will take greater control of how taxpayers' money is spent. As part of this, Miss Truss will slash the sums given to organisations such as the United Nations and World Bank. The cash will be redirected to British-led programmes, giving the Government a bigger say over how it is used. More than PS4.4billion of the PS11.5billion spent on foreign aid last year was distributed through international bodies. Miss Truss will set a target to reduce the amount going to multilateral organisations so that it accounts for just a quarter of the Foreign Office's aid spending by 2025, down from almost 40 per cent at present. The focus on schemes managed by the UK will ensure money goes on key priorities including ending violence against women and providing humanitarian support in places such as Ukraine. A source close to Miss Truss said: 'Spending money directly with countries on British-led projects means we can fund priorities that matter to Britain.' The new strategy will also allow the government to forge partnerships with like-minded countries to deliver join-programmes. As part of the response to the Ukraine crisis, the UK is already working with Poland to provide vital aid to Ukrainians. At the same time as reducing the share of Britain's foreign aid budget that is spent through international organisations, Miss Truss will say that the she wants to 'push for reform' of the multilateral programmes the country will continue to fund. The Foreign Secretary wants to work with other like-minded countries to improve value for money. She has previously said the new overseas development will 'promote British expertise and bring more countries into the orbit of free, democratic nations and ultimately benefit the British people'. The government has already cut PS1.5billion from a World Bank programme to help poor countries to recover from Covid-19. Britain will reduce its contribution to the latest round of the bank's development funding scheme, which will run for three years, from just under PS3billion to PS1.4billion. This country had previously been the biggest donor, but after reducing its share of support by 54 per cent it has fallen behind the United States and Japan. It remains the largest European donor. As part of the emergency measures to deal with the pandemic, Rishi Sunak ditched the Tory manifesto promise to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas development. This led to the foreign aid budget being slashed last year (2021) by PS3.0billion to PS11.5billion. At the Budget last October (2021), the Chancellor said cuts to the foreign aid budget would remain in place for at least another three years. He told MPs he expected the improving public finances to allow him to restore the commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income on overseas development aid in the 2024-25 financial year.", "10bc182a93b0bf4fd4bb45794241f7c5b542cf41225f1a6e95370322": "James Corden has praised Prince Harry as a devoted husband and father and revealed their children have play dates together. The chat show host, 43, has become pals with Harry and his wife Meghan Markle and lives just an hour and a half away from the couple's sprawling mansion in Montecito, California. Speaking to The Sun, James revealed he and wife Julia Carey have been for dinner with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their kids also spend time together. Asked if he had been to the couple's PS11million home, James said: 'I have. It was more a sort of play date scenario [with the kids]. Then we went out for dinner after, it was lovely.' James and Julia are parents to children Max, 11, Carey, seven, and Charlotte, four, while Prince Harry and Meghan share Archie, three, and Lilibet, 11 months. Harry previously appeared as a guest on The Late Late Show shortly after he moved to Los Angeles with Meghan.  Adding that he knows Harry better than Meghan, James said he finds it hard to be 'judgemental' of the pair, seemingly referring to their decision to step down as senior members of the royal family and move to the US.   He said: 'I have a huge amount of respect and admiration for Harry, and anyone who has been around him and spent time with him would feel exactly the same way. 'I think he is a devoted and loving husband and father and I think what they have done [in turning away from royal life] is incredibly brave and I'll always be in their corner.' Although he is quitting his CBS chat show in 2023, James said he is also a big fan of Prince William and Kate Middleton and would love to have them as guests but added he is not 'holding [his] breath'. James and his wife Julia are planning to relocate to the UK after his time on his CBS show has come to an end. The comedian said they will start tentatively house-hunting when he is back in London next month. The star also said that he would be open to hosting another chat show in the future but thinks it would be 'odd' to do something similar to The Late Late Show. James said he never wanted the show to feel like it had overstayed its welcome and hopes there will still be other things for him to do. James promised to 'go out with a bang' as he informed audiences of his decision to step down as the host of The Late Late Show.  James said the show had 'changed my life' and promised there would be 'lots of tears' when his tenure came to an end. 'Seven and half years ago I started hosting this show and there's no other way to put it, it has changed my life,' he said. 'I never saw as it as my final destination, and I never want this show to overstay its welcome, I love making it and I really think in a year from now that will be a good time to move on and see what's out there.' He added: 'We are all determined to make this the best year we have ever had...we are going to go out with a bang.

Speaking to parliament on World ME Day yesterday, the health and social care secretary claimed he was 'committed to better care and support for people living with ME and their families'. The condition affects up to 250,000 people in the UK and 17million around the world. Javid, who is the first senior government minister to speak about the condition, will lead a plan for new research and better patient care. He will work with his department's chief scientific adviser, Professor Lucy Chappell, and is already liaising with the Scottish government, according to The Times.  He said: 'At the heart of the delivery plan will be two core principles; firstly, that we do not know enough about ME/CFS, which must change if we are to improve experiences and outcomes. Secondly, we must trust and listen to those with lived experience of ME/CFS.' ME is a long-term and poorly understood condition that causes a range of symptoms. Its main symptom is extreme tiredness and feeling generally unwell. There is no diagnostic test for ME, so doctors decide whether a patient has the condition based on their symptoms and ruling out other conditions. As it stands, the treatments offered to patients for ME are cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), a talking therapy used for anxiety and depression, and a structured exercise programme called graded exercise therapy (GET). Javid continued: 'ME/CFS affects the lives of children and adults across the country. It can be an incredibly disabling condition with fluctuating symptoms making it difficult to take part in everyday activities, enjoy a family or social life, access services and engage in work or education -- especially for the estimated 25 per cent of people who have severe or very severe symptoms. 'The government recognised that ME is an under-researched area and pledges to support research funders and the academic community to respond to this independent report. 'It is so important that the voice of those with lived experience of ME and those that represent them is at the heart of all future work to improve the lives of people living with this debilitating illness.' Last year, the NHS postponed indefinitely long-awaited NHS guidelines on how to treat chronic fatigue syndrome.  Health watchdogs halted the publication of advice because of disagreements about treatment recommendations they were planning to make. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said it was unable to produce guidelines on ME/CFS which were 'supported by all'.  It is understood the final advice would have urged doctors to stop offering patients graded exercise therapy (GET). The controversial therapy -- which charities say suggest it's psychological -- involves doing increasingly more exercise to build-up a tolerance for carrying out physical activity. Health chiefs were also set to advise against the routine use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) -- commonly used to treat anxiety and depression.  ME is a long-term and poorly understood condition that causes a range of symptoms. It is grouped together with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and is also known as CFS/ME. Its main symptom is extreme tiredness and feeling generally unwell. Some people suffer from sleep problems, muscle and joint pain, headaches, a sore throat and problems thinking. And they might also experience flu-like symptoms, feeling dizzy or stick and having a fast or irregular heartbeat. The severity of symptoms can change day to day and doing too much activity usually makes them worse - known as post-exertional malaise. People with ME can have huge differences in their symptoms and how long they last.  Around 250,000 people in the UK and 17million around the world are estimated to have the condition.  There is no diagnostic test for ME, so doctors decide whether a patient has the condition based on their symptoms and ruling out other conditions. As it stands, the treatments offered to patients for ME are cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), a talking therapy used for anxiety and depression, and a structured exercise programme called graded exercise therapy (GET). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) was due to publish guidelines this month that would no longer recommend these treatments. But strong opinions around the illness made it impossible for NICE to reach a consensus on the treatments it should tell doctors to offer.

The show, which kicked off yesterday and will run until Sunday, is the Queen's favourite event of the year but Princess Beatrice stepped in for Her Majesty in a 'dress rehearsal' for Sunday night's festivities, The Mirror reports.  Beatrice was said to have 'delighted to be asked to play the role of the Queen' to make sure the event would go 'without a hitch should Her Majesty wish to attend the Royal Windsor Horse Show in this way.' Instead of attending the event, the Queen chose to visit her own horses, having 'simply changed her mind', The Sun reports. She has not missed the show in 79 years and this year's event will see 14 of her horses competing. The Queen had been set to be driven 500 yards from her Windsor Castle apartments to see her five-year-old gelding First Responder compete, but her appearance was suddenly called off minutes before the horse was due to take part.  She then privately visited her other horses entered into the contest at the Royal Mews at the castle, reports indicate.   It came as this week the Queen dramatically pulled out of the State Opening of Parliament for the first time in 59 years because of her increasing mobility issues. Prince Charles read her speech for the first time, accompanied by Prince William, who had never attended before. And it has been revealed that Beatrice and Edo, as well as Princess Eugenie, 32, and her husband Jack Brooskbank, along with several other royals, won't make an appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Queen's Jubilee celebrations.  The balcony appearance, which is often seen as the centrepiece of major royal occasions, including Trooping the Colour and weddings, usually sees the Queen's extended family gather to watch a flypast and is a rare chance for fans to see the entire extended family together. Following his ejection from public life, after settling a civil court case in America over allegations of sexual abuse against Virginia Giuffre (which he vehemently denies), it was inconceivable that Beatrice and Eugenie's father Prince Andrew would be given a spot.  Despite earlier claims that the Queen offered Prince Harry and Meghan Markle a space on the platform, they too have been left off the list, although they quickly announced today that they will be in London for the celebrations with their two children.  However, in paring the list down to just 16 people to avoid potential diplomatic pitfalls, the Queen has been forced to omit a number of well-liked family members including her much-loved grandchildren and their families.  Her cousins, including Prince Michael of Kent, and their families, with whom the Queen enjoys a warm relationship are also out in the cold, with a total of at least 34 royals absent from the balcony.  The final balcony lineup will boast the Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall; the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children; the Earl and Countess of Wessex and their children; the Princess Royal and Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence; the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester; the Duke of Kent, and Princess Alexandra. The Queen's other adult grandchildren, Peter Philips and Zara Tindall have been excluded with their families, even though their mother Princess Anne and stepfather Sir Timothy Laurence will join the Queen.   In a formal statement about the decision, Buckingham Palace said: 'After careful consideration, The Queen has decided this year's traditional Trooping the Colour balcony appearance on Thursday 2nd June will be limited to Her Majesty and those Members of the Royal Family who are currently undertaking official public duties on behalf of The Queen.'  There are exceptions, however. Prince Anne's husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, who is not a working royal, and the Queen's granchildren Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn, and her great-grandchildren George, Charlotte and Louis are included. The Palace spokesman added: 'The Cambridge and Wessex children are also expected to appear as is Sir Tim Laurence, who the Queen is happy to attend as a frequent attendee and support for the Princess Royal on official engagements.'  The announcement follows reports that her Majesty herself may not appear on the balcony, due to the 96-year-old's limited mobility. It is believed that aides are working on a 'plan B', with an insider saying: 'It could still happen but it is by no means guaranteed that we will see the Queen on the balcony during the Jubilee.'  While recent balcony appearances have been more focused on senior members of the Firm, normally, there are no restrictions on which family members are present for Trooping of the Colour, the Queen's official birthday.

And what could be more quintessentially British... than a trifle? The Lemon Swiss Roll and Amaretti trifle inspired by the Queen's wedding menu beat more than 5,000 entrants to find a desert which will go down in the annals of history along with the Victoria Sponge and Coronation Chicken. It was created by Jemma Melvin, a 31-year-old copywriter and keen amateur baker from Southport, Merseyside, who was taught by her grandmother. She said the thought of having her pudding re-created up and down the country for Big Jubilee Lunches in June - as well as being sold in royal food store Fortnum & Mason - as 'an absolute pleasure'. Her triumph was revealed in a BBC programme 'The Jubilee Pudding: 70 Years in the Baking' which followed the competition to celebrate the monarch's seven decades on the throne by finding an original and celebratory cake, tart or pudding fit for royalty. The winning trifle wowed judges, including Dame Mary Berry, Masterchef's Monica Galetti and Buckingham Palace Head Chef, Mark Flanagan, at the first mouthful - and it can be easily recreated by people at home. Their decision to pick Jemma's trifle - consisting of lemon curd Swiss roll on the bottom, St Clement's jelly, lemon custard, amaretti biscuits, mandarin coulis, fresh whipped cream, candied peel, chocolate shards and crushed amaretti biscuits on top - was unanimous. The Duchess of Cornwall, who is Patron of The Big Jubilee Lunch, was a surprise special guest at the filming of the final and announced the winning recipe.  JEMMA'S LEMON SWISS ROLL AND AMARETTI TRIFLE Prep time: over 2 hours | Cook time: 35 minutes | Serves: 20 Try this impressive trifle as a crowd-pleasing summer dessert. For this recipe you will need 2 Swiss roll tins, measuring approximately 24cmx34cm / 9 1/2 inx13 1/2 in and a trifle dish with capacity of approximately 3.5 litres/6 pints. However, you could always halve the recipe to serve 10. For shortcuts to this recipe, see Jemma's Top Tips below INGREDIENTS For the Swiss rolls:  For the Lemon curd: For the St Clement's jelly:  For the Custard: For the Amaretti biscuits: For the Chunky mandarin coulis:  For the Jewelled chocolate bark:  1. To make the Swiss rolls, preheat the oven to 180C/ 160C Fan/ Gas 4. Grease and line the 2 Swiss roll tins with baking paper. In a large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together with an electric hand whisk for approximately 5 minutes or until light and pale. Using a metal spoon, gently fold in the flour. Divide between the two tins and bake for 10-12 minutes or until the sponges are lightly golden and cooked through. 2. Sprinkle some extra caster sugar on two sheets of baking paper then turn the sponges out onto the sugared paper. Peel off the paper from the underside and, while still warm, roll them both up from the short end into a tight spiral using the paper to help. Leave to cool.  3. To make the lemon curd, place the egg yolks, granulated sugar, butter, lemon zest and lemon juice in a glass bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (don't let the bowl touch the water). Whisk until combined and whisk continuously as the curd cooks until thickened. This should take about 15 minutes. Pour into a clean bowl and set aside to cool.  4. To make the St Clement's jelly, soak the gelatine leaves in cold water for 5 minutes to soften. Using a vegetable peeler, peel 6 strips from a lemon and 6 strips from an orange and put these into a saucepan with the sugar and 400ml/ 14fl oz water. Bring to a simmer over a medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and discard the peel. Squeeze the water out of the gelatine and stir into the pan until dissolved then leave to cool. Squeeze the lemons and oranges, so you have 150ml/5fl oz of both lemon and orange juice. Stir into the pan then strain the jelly through a fine sieve into a jug and chill until cool but not set.  5. To make the amaretti biscuits, preheat the oven to 180C/ 160C Fan/ Gas 4. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until firm. Mix the sugar and almonds gently into it. Add the amaretto and fold in gently until you have a smooth paste. 6. Place some baking paper on a baking tray and lightly brush with butter or oil.  Using a teaspoon, place small heaps of the mixture approximately 2cm/  3/4 in apart, as they will expand during cooking. Bake for approximately 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.  7. To make the chunky mandarin coulis, strain two tins of mandarins. Discard the juice and put the fruit into a saucepan with the sugar and heat gently until broken down. Remove from the heat. In a small bowl, stir the arrowroot with 2 tablespoons cold water to make a paste, then add to the warm mandarins. Add the lemon juice and mix well before pouring into a large bowl. Strain the remaining two tins of mandarins and add the fruit to the bowl then leave to cool completely. 8. To make the jewelled chocolate bark, if the peel feels wet or sticky, roll in the caster sugar to absorb any moisture. Melt the white chocolate in a bowl sitting over a saucepan of gently simmering water. Pour the white chocolate onto a baking tray lined with baking paper and scatter over the mixed peel. Leave to set then break into shards.  9. To assemble, unroll the cooled Swiss rolls and spread with the lemon curd. Roll back up again and slice one into 2.5cm/ 1in slices and place upright around the bottom edge of the trifle dish so the swirl is visible. Slice the other Swiss roll into thicker pieces and use these to fill the bottom of the dish, ensuring the top is roughly the same level as the slices that line the edge. Use off-cuts of sponge to fill any gaps. 10. Pour the St Clement's jelly over the Swiss roll layer and set aside in the fridge to completely set. This will take approximately 3 hours. Once set, pour over the custard then arrange a single layer of amaretti biscuits, keeping a few back for the top. Pour over the mandarin coulis. In a large bowl, whip the double cream until soft peaks form then spoon this over the coulis. Crumble over the reserved amaretti biscuits and decorate with the chocolate bark shards JEMMA'S TOP TIPS: To simplify this recipe, you can use ready-made versions for most of the components and just make the Swiss rolls and mandarin coulis from scratch. For the lemon curd, use 300g/10 1/2 oz ready-made lemon curd. Instead of the St Clement's jelly, use 1 packet of lemon-flavoured jelly and follow the packet instructions to make 568ml/1 pint. For the custard, use 500ml/18fl oz ready-made custard. For the biscuits, use 100g/ 3 1/2 oz ready-made amaretti biscuits. Instead of making the jewelled chocolate bark, you can finish this trifle by scattering over the reserved amaretti biscuits, mixed peel and 50g/1 3/4 oz white chocolate chunks KATHRYN'S PASSIONFRUIT AND THYME FRANGIPANE TART Prep time: over 2 hours | Cook time: 40 minutes | Serves: 12  This fruit and herb sweet tart is filled with frangipane and cream cheese and topped with jelly. For this recipe you will need a 25cm/ 10in fluted tart tin. Instead of using freshly squeezed passionfruit to create the juice, you can replace this with 180ml/ 6fl oz ready-made passionfruit juice.  INGREDIENTS  For the Pastry:  For the Frangipane:  For the Passionfruit jelly:  For the Cream cheese filling: To decorate:   1. To make the pastry, mix the flour, butter and sugar in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment until the butter is broken down. Add the egg yolk, vanilla and milk, then mix until it comes together. Wrap in cling film and leave to rest for at least 30 minutes in the fridge.  2. Once chilled, roll out on a floured surface and line a 25cm/10in fluted tart tin, making sure to leave an overhang. Put it back in the fridge for a minimum of 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200C/ 180C Fan/ Gas 6. Blind bake the pastry, filled with baking beans, for 15 minutes then remove the beans and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Let the pastry cool for 10 minutes. 3. To make the frangipane, put all the ingredients in a bowl and mix until combined. Spread a thin layer in the tart shell and smooth before putting it in the oven. Cook for 20 minutes. 4. To make the passionfruit jelly, bring the passionfruit juice and thyme sprigs to a simmer in a saucepan, turn off the heat and leave for 30 minutes. Dissolve the gelatine in the cold water and set aside. Bring the passionfruit mixture back to a simmer, remove from the heat and then add the bloomed gelatine, sugar and vanilla paste and whisk until the gelatine has dissolved. Sieve the mixture into a bowl and leave to cool. 5. To make the cream cheese filling, put the cream cheese, salt, vanilla paste and icing sugar in a bowl, and whisk with an electric whisk until combined. In a separate bowl, whisk the double cream to soft peaks, then combine with the cream cheese mixture using a spatula. Measure 30ml/1fl oz from the passionfruit jelly liquid and mix this in until combined. 6. To assemble, once the tart is cool, use a vegetable peeler to shave the pastry overhang so it is level with the tin. Add the cream cheese mixture and spread it out evenly and as level as possible which should leave a small gap on the top for the jelly. Pour over the cool liquid jelly and chill in the fridge for at least 3 hours, or ideally overnight.  7. To decorate, top with whole cherries, raspberries, blueberries, and a few mint leaves in a crescent shape along one side. Add some gold leaf to the fruit for extra pizzazz.   SAM'S JUBILEE BUNDT CAKE  Prep time: 20 minutes | Cook time: 45 minutes | Serves: 16  Create a showstopping centrepiece for your street party or special occasion. The homemade jam is flavoured with Dubonnet, said to be a favourite drink of Queen Elizabeth II. If you're short on time, you can replace the homemade jam with 300g/ 10 1/2 oz ready-made raspberry jam. For this recipe you will need a 20cm/ 8in silicone bundt mould, a 23cm/ 9in springform cake tin, 1 small and 1 large star-shaped piping nozzle and piping bags INGREDIENTS    For the Bundt cake:  For the Sponge:  For the Jam:  For the Buttercream:  To decorate:  1. Preheat the oven to 200C/ 180C Fan/ Gas 6. To make the bundt cake, mix together the butter and caster sugar in a mixer or large bowl until light and fluffy. Add one egg at a time with one tablespoon of flour. Mix until the egg is only just incorporated into the mix. Using a metal spoon, fold in the remaining flour a third at a time and finally fold through the vanilla and milk.  2. Transfer the mix to the bundt mould and cook for 45 minutes. Insert a skewer into the middle of the cake to check it is cooked. Use kitchen foil to cover the top should it need a little longer and to avoid it turning too brown on top. Leave to cool to room temperature then turn out of the mould and set aside.  3. To make the sponge, follow the same steps as for the bundt cake but using the measurements for the sponge. Grease a 23cm/ 9in springform cake tin and line with baking paper. Pour the mixture into the tin and cook for 30 minutes. Insert a skewer into the middle of the cake to check it is cooked. Use kitchen foil to cover the top should it need a little longer and to avoid it turning too brown on top. Leave to cool to room temperature then turn out of the tin and set aside.  4. To make the jam, chop the strawberries into quarters and put them in a bowl. Cover with the Dubonnet and let them soak for 10 minutes.  5. Strain the fruit, reserving the Dubonnet, and add them to a saucepan along with the raspberries, granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons of the reserved Dubonnet. Increase the heat to medium-high until the mixture has a full rolling boil. Reduce the heat to medium, stirring continuously, and simmer away for approximately 25 minutes or until the jam has thickened. Remove from the heat and allow to cool  6. To make the buttercream, use an electric mixer or whisk to beat the butter until light. Add a third of the icing sugar and continue to beat until well incorporated. Add the vanilla extract, milk and remaining icing sugar and mix until the buttercream is light and fluffy. This will take approximately 3 minutes.  7. To assemble, slice the sponge cake in half and spread all but 3 tablespoons of the jam on the bottom half of the sponge. Using a piping bag, pipe two thirds of the buttercream on top of the jam using a large star-shaped nozzle then place the other half of the sponge cake on top.  8. Trim the base of the bundt cake to ensure it is flat. Place the remaining jam into the centre top of the sponge cake and place the bundt cake on top. Using the small star-shaped nozzle, pipe the reserved buttercream decoratively around the exposed sponge and place the halved cherries on top to cover the join between the sponge and the bundt. Use the remaining buttercream to stick the raspberries and blueberries in place - with a raspberry on the very top of each bundt peak and the blueberries around the outside, then dust with icing sugar.    SHABNAM'S ROSE FALOODA CAKE  Prep time: 1 1/2  hours | Cook time: 25 minutes | Serves: 12  This pretty pink-and-white cake looks beautiful as it's topped with edible flowers and gold leaf, and it also tastes amazing with light vanilla and rose flavours. For this recipe you will need two 20cm/ 8in cake tins, a piping bag fitted with a wide plain nozzle and a pastry brush. For a simpler way to decorate this cake, you can use ready-made edible cake decorations such as flower shapes and gold stars.  INGREDIENTS  For the Sponges:  For the Icing: For the Falooda:  To assemble: 1. To make the sponges, preheat the oven to 180C/ 160C Fan/ Gas 4. Grease the sides of two 20cm/ 8in cake tins lightly with butter and line the bases with baking paper. Heat the milk, then add the saffron strands and leave to infuse and cool to room temperature.  2. Cream together the butter and sugar in a large bowl, whisking together until very light and fluffy. In another bowl, mix together the flour, cornflour, baking powder and salt. One at a time, add an egg with a tablespoon of the flour mixture to the butter and sugar, mixing well between each addition. Scrape down the sides and gently but gradually whisk in the rest of the flour mixture, followed by the saffron milk and vanilla.  3. Divide the cake batter evenly between the two lined tins and smooth the tops. Bake for 20-25 minutes -- or until the tops are golden and a toothpick inserted into the centre of the cakes comes out clean. Remove from the oven and leave on a rack to cool for 10 minutes before turning out, removing the baking paper and leaving to cool completely. 4. To make the icing, soak the basil seeds in a small bowl of cold water for 15 minutes then drain through a sieve. 5. In a medium bowl, beat the cream and icing sugar together until thick then whisk in the mascarpone until smooth.  Set 4 tablespoons aside in a small bowl and divide the rest into two bowls, one with slightly more than the other. To the bowl with slightly less fold in the basil seeds and 3 tablespoons rose syrup. Leave the larger bowl plain and to the small bowl containing 4 tablespoons of the mixture, add 1 tablespoon rose syrup. Put them all in the fridge to firm up for 20 minutes. 6. To make the falooda, cook the noodles in boiling water for 1 minute then drain and cool under cold running water. Leave to dry before mixing with the rose syrup. 7. To assemble, use a pastry brush to add 1 tablespoon of rose syrup onto the flat side of each sponge, then place one sponge syrup-side up onto a serving plate. Spread over most of the basil seed and rose cream, then use a piping bag with a wide plain nozzle to pipe the remaining cream all the way around the edge, to create a wall which will keep all the filling in place. Add the vermicelli mixture, rose petal jelly, chopped glace fruit and almonds to the centre, then place the second sponge on top, syrup-side down.  8. Generously ice the top and sides with the plain bowl of cream, then use the small bowl of pink icing to create decorative pink streaks up the sides. Chill in the fridge for 1 hour or so to firm up. Cover with edible flowers or rose petals, flaked pistachios, and the optional gold leaf.   SUSAN'S FOUR NATIONS PUDDING  Prep time: over 2 hours | Cook time: 35 minutes | Serves: 12 Bring the best of British ingredients together in this celebratory pudding. An elegant white chocolate mousse is paired with a punchy fruit compote on top of a biscuit base laced with Welsh cakes - all finished with plenty of vibrant summer berries. For ideas on how to simplify this recipe, see Susan's handy tips. For this recipe you will need a 20cm/ 8in savarin mould and 10 small 4cm/ 1 1/2 in semi-sphere moulds. INGREDIENTS For the Fruit compote:  For the Welsh cakes:  For the Biscuit base:  For the White chocolate mousse:  To decorate:  1. To make the fruit compote, chop the rhubarb and strawberries into small pieces - no bigger than 1cm/  1/2 in in size. Place in a saucepan with the raspberries, sugar and vanilla then bring to the boil. Leave to cook for 5 minutes until the fruit has softened but still holds its shape then set aside to cool. Once cooled, pipe or spoon into 10 small 4cm/ 1 1/2 in semi-sphere moulds and freeze for a minimum of 2 hours. Pass any remaining compote through a sieve and refrigerate.  2. To make the welsh cakes, put the flour, baking powder, sugar, cinnamon and a pinch of salt into a bowl. Then, rub in the butter until the mix is crumbly. Stir through the currants and the egg until you have a soft dough. 3. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough until approximately 1.5cm/  1/2 in thick. Cut out rounds using a 6cm/ 2 1/2 in cutter, re-rolling any excess. Grease a large frying pan with butter and place over a medium heat. Cook the Welsh cakes for about 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through. Leave to cool.  4. To make the biscuit base, preheat the oven to 200C/ 180C Fan/ Gas 6. Once the Welsh cakes are cool, blitz 3 of them in a food processor until they become a fine crumb.  5. Cream together the butter, sugar, ground almonds and the egg, then mix in the melted chocolate and blitzed Welsh cakes until it forms a dough. The mixture will be sticky so roll between two sheets of baking paper until it is the thickness of a pound coin and just a bit larger than the size of the base of the 20cm/8in savarin mould. Remove the top sheet of baking paper.  6. Transfer the remaining sheet of baking paper with the rolled out dough onto on a baking tray. Bake for 15 minutes. While still hot, place the savarin mould on top of the biscuit and use as a template to cut out a 20cm/8in disc.  Cut out the central circle too so you are left with a biscuit ring that matches the shape of the savarin mould. For ease, cut this ring into 4 quarters so you can add it to the base of the pudding when it is ready.  7. To make the white chocolate mousse, soak the gelatine leaves in cold water. Meanwhile, bring 150ml/ 5fl oz whipping cream to a gentle boil. Once the gelatine leaves have bloomed, squeeze the water from them and add to the boiled cream, stirring to make sure it all dissolves. Finely chop the white chocolate and place in a large bowl then pour over the hot cream. Stir until all the chocolate has completely melted, then set aside to cool. 8. Line the savarin mould with cling film, leaving some to overhang at the edges, keeping the surface of the cling film as smooth as possible. In a separate bowl whisk the remaining 450ml/16fl oz whipping cream to soft peaks then fold it into the melted white chocolate. Use a piping bag or spoon to neatly pipe the mixture into the silicone pudding mould then tap the whole thing on your work surface a couple of times to knock out any air bubbles. Gently remove the frozen fruit compote from the moulds then insert them into the mousse. Press them down, but not so far that they poke through the sides or top, then add the quarters of the biscuit to cover the base and press gently. Freeze the whole pudding for a minimum of 3 hours, or ideally overnight.  9. To decorate, carefully turn out the pudding onto a large plate 30 minutes before serving, using the cling film to gently lift away the mould. Toss the strawberries and raspberries in the reserved blitzed fruit compote then use to decorate, along with some edible flowers. SUSAN'S TOP TIPS To simplify the fruit inserts, use 200g/ 7oz ready-made mixed fruit compote. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the compote for later, then divide the rest between the moulds. If you don't have any semi-sphere moulds, you can freeze the mixture in 10 small ice cube holes instead. Using a silicone mould for the pudding will make it easier to remove. If you're using a metal savarin mould, leave at room temperature for a few minutes to warm a little before turning out as above, using the clingfilm to help you remove the pudding.

She gave Jemma a warm hug and told her: 'Many congratulations.' Dame Mary Berry, chair of the judging panel, said: 'It's absolutely wonderful, I think Britain is going to be so delighted and The Queen too.' Jemma, who started baking when she was six, said: 'Oh my! I have to tell my grandma first. 'She is the person that taught me how to bake and I am so excited to tell her. She's going to be so proud, I can't wait, I can't wait. 'I am so happy. I am so happy. Thank you so much, Mary. It's been an honour as well to have your feedback. It's just meant the world to me so thank you. 'The thought of people recreating my pudding, especially round the Jubilee, is just a total pleasure.' Her recipe came out tops in the all-women final, fulfilling the criteria of being fit for a queen, have a memorable story, taste just right, be perfect for home bakers and with the potential to stand the test of time. Jemma, who lives with her long-term and 'chief taster' partner, James, and their rescue-dog Bella, said: 'My inspiration is both my gran and my nan. 'My gran is with us but sadly my nan is not. They are both extremely important to me. My gran taught me how to bake but my nan's signature dish was a trifle. 'A wonderful, poised lady, just like our Queen. She used to make a wonderful trifle, but hers was laced with sherry and decorated with kiwi fruit and flaked chocolate, but this trifle is elevated and fit for The Queen herself. 'I found out that The Queen had lemon posset at her wedding so I decided the pudding had to be based around the lemon flavour. My gran and my nan, they very much liked lemon as well, so it all just slotted into place.' She added: 'I think it'll be perfect for Jubilee celebrations as it's refreshing for Summer. It can also be made in a large dish or in individual portions - whichever you'd prefer.' Jemma said her boyfriend, fortunately, has 'hollow legs' but that she also used her family and friends as guinea pigs for her desert. However as she was sworn to secrecy, she couldn't tell them what she was actually trying the recipe out for. 'Even my boyfriend didn't really know what he was tasting at the time,' she said. She said going to Fortnum & Mason to make her pudding for the final was a surreal experience. 'I'm a northern girl from a northern town, a seaside town. It's so outside of my normal life,' she said. Asked what she plans to do for the Jubilee weekend, she said: 'I'm going to be making my recipe for my gran at her street party.' Fortnum & Mason Executive Pastry Chef and Judge, Roger Pizey, said he thought that people would be making Jemma's trifle 'for at least the next 50 to 100 years without a doubt'. Judge Monica Galetti added: 'I love lemon and sometimes people hold back, and they're scared to put that lemon into it, and as you're eating it you're thinking, 'oh it can't get any better'. 'I got chunks of the amaretti biscuit that have soaked up the cream and they're chewy and I am so happy right now.'

William Burns, 66, warmed the hearts of millions of Britons yesterday after being pictured sharing a tearful embrace with the future king of England during his visit to Glasgow. The touching moment took place as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge greeted royal fans in Kennishead as they embarked on the first of their two-day tour of the country on Wednesday. But during the visit, Prince William ripped up the royal rulebook by ditching formality and sharing the embrace with an emotional Mr Burns. He also stopped for a selfie with his wife Ellen.  Mr Burns, a grandfather-of-25 and a social housing resident who lives in Kennishead, a neighbourhood to the south of Glasgow, said he became emotional because the moment reminded when a 'son hugs a father'.  And the moment had a particular significance for Mr Burns, a father-of-six, who once fell out with one of his sons during an incident which led to him being evicted.  The eviction, which led to grandfather-of-twenty five Mr Burns briefly being made homeless, came after the tragic death of his first wife Jean, who passed away while in his arms. So when asked about his emotional embrace with Prince William, Mr Burns said: 'I am a grandfather. It felt like a son hugging a father.  'It was the way he hugged me. I didn't expect that really to be honest. It was a boost. I've never felt anything like it in my entire life before and my existence as a human being. Now retired, the former chef first moved to the area when he was nine from the island of Tiree in the Hebrides, in 1969-1970. He was born at Rottenrow maternity hospital, before his parents returned to the Highlands. 'My mother and I came back to Glasgow, when I was six years old. It was after my father passed away,' he said. 'She got a home across the road from where I live now and worked in a soap factory. 'Before I was born, my brother Stephen was born handicapped. he died aged 30. I am a little handicapped too. 'I have had a stroke and a couple of heart attacks. I have Raynaud's disease which makes the ends of my fingers go blue and my chest feels very tight. 'I'm at risk of further heart attacks so I have to be careful, but I'm still here. 'As a kid, I wore a kilt until then but when I came to Glasgow my mother put me in trousers. I had to learn English and I did well in school.' Mr Burns studied electronics at Glasgow Cardonald College before going on to work for the TV rental company DER. He also worked as a chef in a Chinese restaurant. When he was 17, he married the love of his life, his first wife Jean Edie. 'She fell pregnant and I had to marry her,' Mr Burns said, chuckling. 'I fell in love with the girl and she did the same with me. 'We were married in 1970.' The pair were married for three decades until her tragic death.   'My first love died in my arms, we were married for 30 years,' Mr Burns, a father-of-six and a grandfather-of-twenty-five, said.  The couple raised six children, Michelle, James, Adele, Stephanie, Kerry and stepson Matthew. He has 25 grandchildren. 'Matthew was Jean's son but I took him as my own,' Mr Burns said. Things soon turned from bad to worse for Mr Burns, who was later evicted from the home he shared with Jean during their marriage.  Mr Burns said he was evicted after one of his son's received four anti-social behaviour orders, which led to a row between him and the son - who he also later described as his wife's child. Speaking about the eviction, he said 'The man who came to evict me kept apologising but I told him he was just doing his job.' But Mr Burns's luck soon turned and he quickly moved in with his now wife, Ellen, who took him in when he was at his lowest. The pair later married and remain together to this day. 'I met Ellen and after the eviction I asked Ellen if I could move in with her and then we got married,' he said. 'She's a lovely lady. We have been married four years in September. We've never been on a honeymoon. We've never been anywhere.' Mr Burns, now suffers from the chronic lung condition emphysema, a lung condition where a person's air sacs - known as alveoli - are damaged. It causes shortness of breath and when alongside chronic bronchitis makes up the often life-limiting condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mr Burns was hailed a hero in local newspapers in the late 1970s when he chased a gang of machete wielding thugs who planned to rob a local Asian convenience store. Despite his difficult life, Mr Burns remains optimistic and described meeting Prince William as a 'boost'. He said he originally went out to see the Prince after seeing 'all the commotion and excitement' at his arrival. 'I thought I would go down for a peek-about. My wife was down there and I was standing talking to people who know me well because I am one of the longest people living here. 'I saw Kate and thought, that lady is wonderful. She is beautiful and clearly a beautiful person. I was standing with my wife when William came over to the crowd. 'I decided to meet the chap and I went to shake the man's hand when he asked my name. 'When I told him my name was William, he said, 'My name is William too.' I said, 'I know that' and he laughed. He had his hand on my shoulder. 'He had his hand on my shoulder and then hugged me. I was quite emotional. I was overjoyed. 'I am a grandfather. It felt like a son hugging a father. It was the way he hugged me. I didn't expect that really to be honest. It was a boost. I've never felt anything like it in my entire life before and my existence as a human being.' Mr Burns was also full of praise for the Prince, who he said will make a 'great King'.   'I told him about the housing association providing safe homes for the people and he said that was fantastic. He's not King yet but he will be a good King for Scotland as well as the whole of the UK. 'He'll do well for Britain. He will be a fantastic King and he will keep Scotland and Britain together.' His wife Ellen also revealed William joked with her that she didn't know how to use a mobile phone after she asked him for a selfie. The Prince then took the cherished shot for her. Ellen said: 'I asked the Prince if I could get a photo with him and he said, 'No bother. You don't know how to use the phone, do you?'. 'He took the phone and turned the camera around. So he took the selfie. 'My husband was worried he would get the jail for hugging the Prince but it was the Prince who hugged him.   'Princess Di hugged people and I think he copies his mum. Kate was gorgeous. It was a beautiful moment.' Having met with Prince William, Ellen said the royal reminded her of his mother, Princess Diana. She said: 'William reminds me of his mum. He is always helping people. He reminds me of his mammy.' The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had visited the Wheatley Group site in Glasgow, to see first-hand how they are transforming the lives of disadvantaged or vulnerable people, including those at risk of homelessness. Despite the joy of the occasion, he also admitted he was worried that he and William would get into trouble for ripping up the royal playbook by ditching formality and sharing the heartwarming embrace with Mr Burns. 'I won't get the jail hopefully and I hope William won't get into trouble for giving me a hug' An insider involved in the royal visit said: 'William said he didn't want suits and security. He wanted to meet the people.' 'I had a meeting with the energy advice team and they gave me great tips on how to use my electricity to keep my bills low. I don't need to put the heating on as much during the day in my new home. It's made a big difference.' The Duke and Duchess were met in Kennishead by John MacLeod, Glasgow Deputy Lieutenant, accompanied by his wife, Mariella McLeod. They were introduced to Wheatley Group Chief Executive Martin Armstrong, Wheatley Group Chair Jo Armstrong and Bernadette Hewitt, the tenant Chair of Wheatley Homes Glasgow. Wheatley Group Chair Jo Armstrong said: 'We were delighted to welcome the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and show them how Wheatley Group is 'Making Homes and Lives Better'. The protocol surrounding touching the Royal Family has historically been so strict that a simple breach like a hand on the back, even by a well-meaning dignitary, was enough to spark outrage.  While older generations of royals might have seen a lack of contact as a way to communicate a higher status - it appears the Duke and Duchess are attempting to be more approachable. There are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting a member of the Royal Family, but many chose to observe traditions, which is to bow or curtsey. The tender moment saw the Duke break strict royal protocol, in a move that echoed the tactile nature of his late mother Princess Diana. The Duke and Duchess appear to have put on their finest charm offensive during the visit, with Kate, 40, seen beaming as she cuddled up and cooed with newborns during yesterday's tour. During their relaxed engagements, William appeared playful as he goofed around with children, before the royal couple posed for selfies with locals.   Their new easygoing approach could also be part of an attempt to modernise the Royal Family after their Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas trip which was hit by public relations gaffes and protests.  In fact, royal sources claimed recently that in wake of the tour, the couple want to be known by their first names instead of their titles and are considering getting rid of bows and curtsies.    'The general consensus was that the tour seemed out of date, out of touch, too formal and stuffy', a royal source told the Mirror.  'So now it's more 'Wills and Kate' instead of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge... 'Just call me Wills' type of thing. 'They want to try to avoid the bows and curtsies in public, be more approachable, less formal, less stuffy, and break away with a lot of the tradition and focus on a modern monarchy.' The news comes as the Queen moves ahead with slimming down the Monarchy and the Palace announced that only senior Royals, which do not include Prince Harry and Meghan and Prince Andrew, will be on the palace balcony for the showpiece Platinum Jubilee celebration. During their visit the royal couple met Wheatley Homes Glasgow tenant Joanne Wales, 31, who opened the front door of her new-build home to welcome Their Royal Highnesses. Inside they met son Jason, four, and heard from Joanne how the energy-efficient house design is helping reduce her energy bills. Joanne said: 'With four young kids the energy bill is a big concern. There's always a need for a new pair of shoes or new clothes.  'I had a meeting with the energy advice team and they gave me great tips on how to use my electricity to keep my bills low. I don't need to put the heating on as much during the day in my new home. It's made a big difference.' The Duke and Duchess were met in Kennishead by John MacLeod, Glasgow Deputy Lieutenant, accompanied by his wife, Mariella McLeod.  They were introduced to Wheatley Group Chief Executive Martin Armstrong, Wheatley Group Chair Jo Armstrong and Bernadette Hewitt, the tenant Chair of Wheatley Homes Glasgow.  Wheatley Group Chair Jo Armstrong said: 'We were delighted to welcome the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and show them how Wheatley Group is 'Making Homes and Lives Better'. 'They were very interested in the work of our Foundation, about how Wheatley is giving young people the best start in life and also how we are creating new job and training opportunities so customers can reach their full potential.  'We also explained how Wheatley is playing a key role across Scotland in tackling homelessness and giving people a home of their own.' The Duke of Cambridge is a long-standing campaigner for the homeless and is patron of Centrepoint, which helps homeless young people get back into education, training and employment.  The charity was William's first patronage and the royal took over the role from his late mother Princess Diana.  In 2009, the Duke decided to spend the night rough sleeping in order to understand the plight of the homeless at Christmas, staying out in temperatures as low as minus 4c in an alleyway near Blackfriars bridge.  The Prince said afterwards that the experience had helped to deepen his understanding of life on the streets, calling the charity's work 'desperately important'.  ", "94596f57b848d682dcd0a2bd5f939ad1c09d24f1dafa90fb13185e71": "Russia's top commander General Valery Gerasimov has been suspended, a top adviser to the Ukrainian president has claimed, while a clutch of other officers have been sacked or arrested amid a rumoured purge of top brass. Oleksiy Arestovych, a veteran of military intelligence and one of President Zelensky's inner circle, claimed late Wednesday that Gerasimov - the chief of staff of the Russian army - has been suspended as Putin looks for senior commanders to blame over his blundering invasion of Ukraine. Arestovych, speaking to dissident Russian lawyer and politician Mark Feygin on YouTube last night, said: 'According to preliminary information, Gerasimov has been de-facto suspended. They are deciding whether to give him time to fix things, or not.' He added: 'The commander of the first tank army of the western military district Lieutenant General Sergei Kisel has also been arrested and fired after the first tank army was defeated near Kharkiv.' Two further army commanders have been fired due to heavy battlefield losses, according to information released on a Telegram channel run by the Ukrainian interior ministry, which also claimed the commander of the Black Sea fleet has been sacked and arrested and his vice admiral has been placed under investigation. Arestovych stressed that his information is 'preliminary', but it comes after Gerasimov failed to appear during Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow on Monday which he was widely expected to attend. It also comes after he was reportedly wounded by shrapnel in Ukraine when Putin sent him there in order to turn the war around.  Putin's army - once championed as the world's second-best - has been handed a series of humiliating battlefield defeats in just two months of fighting in Ukraine that has seen more than 10,000 troops killed, hundreds of tanks destroyed, its Black Sea flagship sunk and Russia's international standing trashed. Just yesterday, it was revealed that Russian troops were massacred while trying to cross a river in the Donbas after Ukraine discovered their sneak-attack and unleashed an artillery barrage that destroyed at least 58 vehicles. 'After the failure in Ukraine - repressions and purges in the Russian army,' a post from the Find Your Own Telegram feed, run by Kyiv's interior ministry, said late yesterday. 'The Commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Igor Osipov, was removed from his post and arrested. [There are] Investigative actions in relation to... first deputy commander of the fleet, Vice Admiral Sergei Pinchuk. 'Due to the large losses of personnel, weapons and military equipment, [Russia] fired: Commander of the 6th Army, Lieutenant General Vladislav Ershov; ommander of the tank army of the western military district, Lieutenant General Sergei Kisel and one of the deputy commanders. '[Also] Commander of the 22nd Army Corps of the Southern Military District, Major General Arkady Marzoev.' If confirmed, it would mark the largest purge of senior military commanders during the conflict so far and represent a tactic admission by Putin that the invasion has largely been a failure. Despite being forced to retreat from Kyiv in the first phase of the war and failing to make a breakthrough in the Donbas in the second, Putin has continued to insist that his military is achieving all of its targets on time and in accordance to the plan - statements echoed by his lapdog officials and puppet propagandists. But the goals have continued to change. Initially, the aim was to seize Kyiv in a rapid attack designed to topple the government and install a puppet regime - revealed by a Russia state media article that was mistakenly published just days after the war started which preemptively declared victory. Once it became clear that Russia lacked the manpower to take Kyiv, it retreated - but generals claimed that had been the goal all along. Kyiv, they said, had now been demilitarized which would allow them to focus all of their efforts on liberating Donbas: A region in the east that Putin has declared to be independent. But Russia has yet to make any significant gains on this front, even in Mariupol - the heavily besieged southern city where Ukrainian troops are holed up in a huge steel works - instead inching forward in a hugely bloody advance that is draining both men and resources. Putin was thought to have ordered his generals to produce a victory for him to brag about during Monday's Victory Day parade in Moscow. In the end, he simply avoided the topic of victory in Ukraine altogether - saying simply that troops were fighting 'for our people in Donbass, for the security of our Motherland, for Russia.' He also made no mention of officially declaring war on Ukraine - a move that many had feared because it could lead to a full mobilisation of Russia's military reserves or a general conscription, with new recruits poured on to the battlefield in an attempt to achieve victory at any cost. It could indicate little more than unrealised hype built around a day that - by its nature - is heavy on symbolism but light on action. Or, viewed another way, it could indicate a change of thinking within the Kremlin and perhaps the start of a climb-down after months of sabre-rattling. Aside from its battlefield defeats, Russia has been hammered economically and politically over the war  - sliding into the worst recession for three decades as a result of lost trade and sanctions pressure, while also being isolated on the world stage. Backing from Beijing for the invasion, which seemed almost certain before the fighting broke out, has been half-hearted - Chinese state media has pushed Russian narratives about the world, but its diplomats have also vocally supported Ukrainian sovereignty and abstained from key votes at the UN. And, on Thursday, Finland's prime minister and president took the much-anticipated step of saying they are in favour of joining NATO with a formal application expected within days. It comes after Britain and America gave the country guarantees to come to its defence if Russia attacks before membership is ratified. The move is likely to prompt Sweden, which shares an exposed coast and border with Finland, to follow suit - putting an end to decades of neutrality. Russia's Foreign Ministry warned the country would take retaliatory 'military-technical' steps and said the move would 'inflict serious damage to the Russian-Finnish relations as well as stability and security in Northern Europe.'  Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council chaired by President Vladimir Putin, said that 'there is always a risk of such conflict turning into a full-scale nuclear war, a scenario that will be catastrophic.'  But even as the globe-shaking repercussions of the invasion spread, the conflict on the ground slogged on, with Ukraine's military recapturing some towns and villages in the country's northeast but acknowledging that Russian forces have seen 'partial success' farther south in the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbas. Western officials say Russia has gained ground and taken some villages but has not managed to seize any cities. Associated Press reporters heard explosions Thursday and saw plumes of smoke near the town of Bakhmut, an area of the Donbas that has seen heavy fighting. The Ukrainian military said that Russian forces were 'storming' two villages near Bakhmut, but the source of the blasts wasn't immediately clear. Russian advances in the east follow weeks of their stubborn efforts to push through Ukrainian defenses in the Donbas. It's unclear how significant the Russian gains have been. But any gains in the east may have come at expense of territory elsewhere. Britain's Defense Ministry said Russia's focus on the Donbas had left its remaining troops around the northeastern city of Kharkiv vulnerable to counterattack from Ukrainian forces, which recaptured several towns and villages around the city. Still, Russian rocket strikes Thursday killed one person and wounded three in a suburb of Kharkiv, the regional governor said. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, has suffered heavy Russian bombardment during the war as Russia sought to encircle it. Fighting across the east has driven thousands of residents from their homes. Evacuees wiped away tears as they carried their children and belongings onto buses and vans to flee. 'It is terrible there now. We were leaving under missiles,' said Tatiana Kravstova, who left the town of Siversk with her 8-year-old son Artiom on a bus headed to the central city of Dnipro. 'I don't know where they were aiming at, but they were pointing at civilians.' Meanwhile, Ukraine's military also said Russian forces had fired artillery and grenade launchers at Ukrainian troops in the direction of Zaporizhzhia, which has been a refuge for civilians fleeing Mariupol, and attacked in the Chernihiv and Sumy regions to the north. Overnight airstrikes in Chernihiv killed three people and wounded 12, according to local media citing emergency services. The regional governor said the strikes on the town of Novhorod-Siverskyi damaged a boarding school, dormitory and administrative building. The military governor of the southern Ukrainian region of Kryvyi Rih accused Russia of using prohibited cluster bombs and phosphorus munitions. The claim could not immediately be verified. Ukraine has previously accused Russian forces of using such munitions in the Donbas, and Ukrainian authorities have launched investigations into their use. In the southern port city of Mariupol, which has seen some of the worst destruction of the war, Ukraine offered to release Russian prisoners of war in exchange for the safe evacuation of badly wounded fighters trapped inside the Azovstal steel mill, the last redoubt of Ukrainian forces in the ruined city. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that negotiations were underway to release the wounded. She said there were different options, but 'none of them is ideal.' Russia hasn't confirmed any talks on the subject but seems unlikely to agree to any such swap as the release of the fighters would be a major morale boost for Ukraine. Russia's forces have taken control of the rest of the city, which they besieged for weeks, as residents ran short of food, water and medicine, though Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the Mariupol mayor, said Thursday that troops have resumed water supplies to two neighborhoods as a test. 'The occupiers turned Mariupol into a medieval ghetto,' said Mayor Vadym Boychenko in comments published by City Hall, as he called for a complete evacuation of the city. Officials said in recent weeks that about 100,000 residents could still be trapped in Mariupol, which had a prewar population of over 400,000. Russian and Ukrainian authorities have periodically agreed to cease-fires to evacuate residents, and repeatedly blamed each other when those efforts failed. Putin reaffirmed Russia's determination to ensure territory in the Donbas held by Moscow-backed separatists never returns to Ukraine in a congratulatory message Thursday to the head of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic. On the eve of its invasion, Russia recognized the separatists' claim to independence in Luhansk as well as in the other Donbas region of Donetsk. Moscow sought to justify its offensive by claiming, without evidence, that Ukraine was planning to attack areas held by separatists and that it intervened to protect people in those regions. Putin also said Thursday that Russia would withstand tough Western sanctions - imposed in response to the invasion - though he said they were provoking a global economic crisis. Speaking to officials during a meeting on the economy, Putin said that Western nations have been 'driven by oversized political ambitions and Russophobia' to introduce the restrictions that 'hurt their own economies and well-being of their citizens' as well as people in the world's poorest countries.", "ff306a2393c4790be16cff78f8c550758705397b5e022f5c0f5cbc7f": "The proportion of students in England getting first class degrees has more than doubled to almost 40 per cent in a decade.  A report by the Office for Students warns grade inflation could be 'baked in' following leniency due to Covid-19. In 2020-21, 38 per cent of students got a first - up from 16 per cent in 2010-11.  Last night, universities minister Michelle Donelan condemned the 'unjustifiable increases'. Universities face fines of up to PS500,000 if they do not reign in the grades bonanza, and should not use the pandemic as an 'excuse', officials said. The institution with the greatest proportion of firsts was the Royal Academy of Music, where an incredible 80 per cent got this grade. This compared with 55 per cent in 2018-19, and 54 per cent a decade ago. It comes after universities adopted 'no detriment' policies during the pandemic, where tutors were told to take into account disruption from various lockdowns. Susan Lapworth, interim chief executive at the OfS, said: 'This report starkly demonstrates the scale of increases in degree classifications in our universities and colleges. 'Unmerited grade inflation is bad for students, graduates and employers, and damages the reputation of English higher education. 'We know that universities and colleges used 'no detriment' policies to respond to the exceptional set of circumstances caused by the pandemic. But grade inflation has been a real credibility issue for the sector for some time and the pandemic cannot be used as an excuse to allow a decade of unexplained grade inflation to be baked into the system.' She added that qualifications needed the trust of the public and to 'stand the test of time'. 'Where this is not the case, the OfS has always said we are prepared to take action,' she said. 'We will be publishing more details about our plans to investigate these issues shortly.' The OfS said that while a small increase in firsts was expected due to better teaching and learning, much of the rise was 'unexplained'. It said more than half of all the first class degrees awarded in 2020-21 could not be explained, when all factors were taken into account", "49f11ba82905d1285d353d4c0d8eb2268cdc78adc4c0637e24fce589": "A mother-of-four is kicking herself after she missed out on a whopping PS3.6 million jackpot by changing her regular lottery numbers for one week only  Lorna Hart, 45, changed her usual EuroMillions numbers which are 3, 25, 27, 28, and 29 for a lucky dip Hot Picks ticket, which generates a random selection of numbers for the main game. Yesterday morning Hart, who lives in Gosport, Portsmouth, went online to check the numbers and she realised she could have won the PS3.6m jackpot had she not decided that week to change her usual numbers. 'I thought I'd try my luck, and then I saw on the news about someone in Britain winning the jackpot so I went to check the results'.  'I was devastated - absolutely gutted. I rang my partner Craig and said, You'll never guess what's happened'. She continued: ' He just it wasn't meant to be and said about all the pressures the money would have bought.' The single mother of four, who suffers from ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis) gave up work eight years ago and she has played the EuroMillions every single week since it began and she had dreamt of winning to buy her own home.  Lorna lives with her three youngest children, Luke, 19, Callum, 16, and Amy, 14. Her eldest daughter, Ellenor, 21, is studying Criminology at Portsmouth University.  'My children called me a numpty and said ''only you could do that''. My 16 year old actually said he would rather earn a million than be given it and said he's going to work for it.'  Despite losing out on the EuroMillions, Lorna says that she is going out with her friends for 'cake instead of champagne'. She added: 'At least I've got family and friends. That's what's really important.  'At the end of the day I went from having a normal life to living with a disability. I would trade all that money to live a normal life. 'So many people have stuck by me and that's worth more than any amount of money. Hart has decided to use the Hot Picks random numbers on her losing ticket in the future. She added: 'I'm going to put those numbers on every week now on the Euromillions and the Lotto because you never know, I might win next time.'", "61cf940d0055575eb7ccdf2c9d92a611def63ed5233c326853f4d612": "Scrapping the licence fee could harm British society, suggested the BBC's director-general yesterday in what will be seen as a warning to Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries. In response to the Government's plans to look at alternative funding for the broadcaster, Tim Davie said ministers needed to consider the kind of broadcasting environment they wanted. Mr Davie said: 'Let's listen to the public. Let's be led by the data and really think carefully about what kind of media market we want in the UK. 'What are we? As storytellers, as a democracy... my biggest thing is the stakes are very high about what kind of society we live in.' He added: 'We are not trying to be Netflix, we are trying to be the BBC.' Mr Davie also told the Deloitte Media and Telecoms conference that the current two-year licence fee freeze means the broadcaster would 'shut a few things' and 'reduce volume'. His comments come after the Government revealed in the recent white paper that it will review the BBC's funding. Mr Davie admitted that the broadcaster's biggest challenge was 'staying relevant'. During the talk the BBC director-general was asked about the Government's review into the funding model of the broadcaster, which was unveiled in a recent white paper. He said the Government needed to consider the kind of broadcasting environment it wanted to see when making decisions about the funding of the corporation. The BBC boss added: 'I believe we will still offer great value for the licence fee payer.' The Government's white paper suggested it will review the funding model, which is expected to dump the licence fee system. This came after Nadine Dorries signalled the end of the licence fee when in an interview she said the Government is 'ready to implement a new way of funding the BBC'. At the event Mr Davie also discussed the options facing the corporation as it looks to make savings following a two-year freeze on the licence fee. He said: 'We've got some choices to make. We'll shut a few things, we'll reduce volume, we'll do some things, but I think we'll still be able to offer great value for the licence fee.' Earlier this week the boss of the National Audit Office suggested the BBC could make more efficiency savings rather than relying on cuts to shows. Mr Davie claimed the BBC needed to 'repurpose our organisation' to make sure the content fitted the needs of the 'on-demand' and gaming environment and the so-called metaverse. He added: 'We are going to have to work out how public service broadcasting delivers in all environments and is not just a market failure, skinny sideshow. I think to do that, we've got to innovate, innovate and keep innovating. 'Any complacency is going to end in serious consequences.'", "552deb27afb5b256f3208ab8ce1b723ac1279410191e4ba3e5632327": "Pressure is mounting on the Chancellor to cut taxes and stave off a recession after the economy went into reverse. Output unexpectedly shrank by 0.1 per cent in March, it was revealed yesterday - and that was before energy bills jumped sharply last month. Now business leaders and MPs are urging Rishi Sunak to provide more support for households, in an attempt to prevent the economy suffering further. NatWest chairman Sir Howard Davies yesterday pushed the Government to focus on low-income families, who could be plunged below the breadline by rising prices. And John Lewis boss Dame Sharon White called for 'decisive action' so households wouldn't be forced to scrimp all through the summer to prepare for another energy bill rise in October. Small business founder Dave Kelly, who runs Bristol butcher's Ruby & White, said it felt like the economy was 'headed for the slaughterhouse'. 'Inflation, soaring energy bills, tax and interest rate rises are crippling households around the country,' he said. 'Worst of all, it feels like the Government is watching on and doing nothing.' Earlier this week, Tesco chairman John Allan said the UK was 'seeing real food poverty for the first time in a generation' as he pressured ministers to ease the cost-of-living crisis. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme yesterday, NatWest's Sir Howard said: 'The squeeze on living standards as a result of higher energy prices and higher food prices is really extraordinary.' He said the poorest fifth of the population would have to slash their 'discretionary' or non-essential spending by a massive 20 per cent. He urged the Government to boost benefits payments to keep up with the cost of living. Meanwhile, Dame Sharon told ITV's Peston: 'I think the time absolutely has come for action, whether it's an emergency budget or whether it's another vehicle. 'As I say, I think we're all really nervous about what's going to happen in October, when energy bills potentially go up again by up to PS1,000, it's winter.' She added that the Government had done 'incredibly well' in helping people quickly during the pandemic with the furlough scheme. 'We need to see the same decisive action taken at speed and at pace,' she said. But Mr Sunak declined to commit to any tax cuts or help for households, although he vowed to boost growth, saying it was 'the best way to help families in the longer-term'. 'The UK economy recovered quickly from the worst of the pandemic and our growth in the first few months of the year was strong - faster than the US, Germany and Italy - but I know these are still anxious times,' he said. 'Our recovery is being disrupted by Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine and other global challenges but we are continuing to help people where we can.' Mr Sunak was blasted earlier this year for pushing ahead with controversial tax hikes at a time when households and businesses were already feeling the pinch from sky-high inflation. These included a rise in national insurance contributions from April, and a freezing of the thresholds used to calculate income tax and inheritance tax. Pressure on the Chancellor has now stepped up after the Office for National Statistics revealed the economic slump in March, which was worse than economists had expected, especially after growth in February was revised down from 0.1 per cent growth to a flat line. A slide in retail and car sales was partly to blame for March's figures. However, the construction sector appeared to be healthy, with growth of 1.7 per cent. In the first quarter of the year, the economy grew by just 0.8 per cent, supported by January's figures. Experts had pencilled in growth of 1 per cent over the three months.", "d3d474bcd4013e0068f10899d9652939d370d25f7100241cb14740cc": "Boris Johnson has promised to look at introducing a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies to help households struggling with rising bills. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is threatening to hit energy firms with a one-off levy if they fail to invest enough in the UK. The Mail revealed yesterday that the Treasury had been told to look into a potential tax.  Ministers had ruled it out over fears it could stop firms investing, but they have warmed to it as concerns grow that the industry is not increasing its spending despite huge profits. Seeking to head off pressure for a windfall tax, BP committed yesterday to reinvesting all profits from its North Sea oil and gas production over the next decade into the UK. Chief executive Bernard Looney said: 'This decade... we expect to reinvest every pound that we make, and hopefully more.'  He told BP's AGM yesterday that a windfall tax would not stop its plans to invest PS18billion in the UK by 2030.  Its profit for the first three months of this year more than doubled to PS4.9billion. Pressed on Mr Looney's comments during an interview with LBC radio, the Prime Minister said he didn't like windfall taxes, but added: 'We'll have to look [at] it.' But he added: 'The disadvantage with those sorts of taxes is that they deter investment in the very things that they need to be investing in - new technology, in new energy supply. Mr Sunak said: 'I'm pragmatic about it... but these companies are making a significant amount of profit at the moment because of these very elevated prices.' He added: 'What I want to see is significant investment back into the economy to support jobs, to support energy security, and I want to see that investment soon.  'If that doesn't happen, then no options are off the table.' Tory backbench MP Robert Halfon yesterday labelled oil company bosses 'the new oligarchs', adding: 'I do think that the Government should consider properly a windfall tax.' But Conservative former minister Sir Christopher Chope said windfall taxes were 'a simplistic solution which always end up hurting the ordinary people who work in this population hardest'. Downing Street said: 'We do keep options on the table - rightly so.'", "3fdc293d9a0af65c43dda5712f70a22bd18e7e119a3e6a4500ab3754": "Angela Rayner attacked the Prime Minister over 'Partygate' fines yesterday - despite the fact that she is under investigation for allegedly breaking lockdown rules. Scotland Yard announced the number of fines issued for illegal Whitehall gatherings had doubled to more than 100, although there were no new penalties for Boris Johnson or his wife, Carrie. Sir Keir Starmer and Mrs Rayner, his deputy, have both pledged to resign if Durham Constabulary fines them over the force's 'Beergate' investigation into a gathering at the Durham Miners Hall on April 30 last year. Despite the probe into her own actions, Mrs Rayner said: 'Boris Johnson's Downing Street has now reached a century of fixed-penalty notices for their partying. 'They have racked up the dubious distinction of receiving more fines on the Prime Minister's watch than any other location. 'Boris Johnson made the rules, and then broke them at record-breaking scale.  'Britain deserves better.' Mr Johnson has already acknowledged that he was fined over his birthday gathering at Downing Street in June 2020, and pledged to make any additional fines public. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Carrie Johnson were both fined over the event, when Mr Johnson was said to have been surprised with a cake. The police investigation into a dozen gatherings continues, with no indication of when it will reach its conclusion.  Senior civil servant Sue Gray will not publish her report into the parties until all police fines have been handed out - despite the fact Scotland Yard is unlikely to carry out any further interviews. The force requested that the report was not published while its investigation was ongoing so as to avoid influencing evidence from interviewees. Interviews are understood to have concluded, but the Metropolitan Police will not formally confirm that no more will take place in case new evidence is presented. Scotland Yard said yesterday: 'As of May 12, Operation Hillman, the investigation into breaches of Covid-19 regulations in Whitehall and Downing Street, has made more than 100 referrals for fixed-penalty notices. 'These referrals have continued to be made throughout the period since our last update on April 12, and the investigation remains live.'  The Prime Minister's spokesman confirmed that Mr Johnson had not been issued with another fine. He said: 'You'll know that the Prime Minister has on a number of occasions apologised and made clear that there were things we simply did not get right, and that he is sorry for how this matter has been handled.  'Obviously, that remains the case. He will have more to say at the conclusion... and when the Sue Gray report is published.'", "01b6635230c96dce0ac5d9683fcc5ee5f1724980ab926efe166ef975": "Cabinet ministers today headed to Stoke-on-Trent for an away-day as Boris Johnson urged Whitehall departments to renew efforts to find 'innovative' ways to support Britons through the cost-of-living crisis. Their visit to Staffordshire comes amid grim economic warnings as official figures showed the UK economy plunged into the red in March. It has fuelled further fears of recession and Chancellor Rishi Sunak this morning admitted the country faces 'anxious times'. There is already huge pressure on Mr Sunak and his Treasury team to come up with another package of support for stuggling households. The Chancellor today offered a strong hint that more help could come in August when the energy regulator once again updates the energy price cap. But, despite the prospect of additional Government action to come this summer, it means Britons still face many more weeks without extra support. Cabinet ministers were due to continue their discussions on other means of helping Britons through the cost-of-living crisis, after the PM's call for 'innovative' solutions. It emerged last month that one Cabinet brainstorming session saw ministers float ideas such as introducing looser childcare rules, allowing Britons to get an MOT for their cars only every two years, and pushing for tariff-free food imports. But the suggestions also attracted claims that the Government is looking to address the cost-of-living crisis on the cheap, without extra spending. In his opening remarks during the Cabinet meeting at a pottery in Stoke, the PM said: 'We're going to make sure we use all our ingenuity, all our compassion, everything we need to do to help people through the difficult aftershocks of Covid, and the inflationary pressures that we're seeing, particularly on the costs of energy. He added this week's Queen's Speech had given ministers 'the legislative firepower to deliver on tackling the underlying issues - the things that are driving up prices, particularly for energy, for people's transport, for the education people need. 'That is why I think the Queen's Speech is so important - infrastructure, education, technology - those are the things that we need to focus on - particularly cutting the cost of energy.' Mr Johnson urged ministers to show 'no lack of resource and compassion now - we're going to have be very, very committed, very, very radical, very, very forward-thinking - but stick to the basics of our thinking about getting people into high wage, high-skilled jobs'. 'Folks, we're going to get through this, it's going to take a lot of focus - but jobs, jobs, jobs is the answer - that is how we will unite and level up across the whole country, and get on with delivering on the mandate that the people gave us two-and-a-half years ago,' he continued. As they arrived at the Cabinet meeting, ministers were tight-lipped about the revelation that more than 100 fines have now been dished out to people working in Downing Street for Partygate breaches of Covid laws. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said she was 'too busy trying to make sure my heels don't fall through the cracks' of the cobbles on the site when asked about the latest batch of Covid fines. Ahead of the Stoke away-day, Downing Street said the PM had 'called on Cabinet colleagues and departments to double down on exploring innovative ways to ease pressures on household finances' as well as 'promoting the support that is available but not widely taken up.' Last month, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps was said to have raised the idea of allowing vehicles to be checked less often, potentially saving drivers hundreds of pounds. Mr Johnson apparently asked for faster progress on reducing the required ratio between adults and children in childcare settings - something that could reduce costs. Cutting tariffs on imports of food not produced in the UK was also thought to been suggested around the Cabinet table. The Government should act before the summer to tackle the cost of living, the boss of John Lewis has said. Sharon White called on ministers to take the same 'decisive action' seen during the coronavirus pandemic amid rising energy prices. Speaking on Peston, which airs at 10.45pm on ITV, Ms White said: 'I think the time absolutely has come for action, whether it's an emergency budget or whether it's another vehicle. 'As I say, I think we're all really nervous about what's going to happen in October, so when energy bills potentially go up again by up to PS1,000, it's winter.' Asked if she wanted action now, she said: 'I do, I think there ought to be action before the summer, so the decisive action that we saw - I thought the Government did incredibly well at pace and scale during Covid - I think we need to see the same decisive action taken at speed and at pace because otherwise... those are impacts across millions of households right across the country.' Ms White said action should be taken even if it means a temporary hit to public finances. Households have seen soaring energy bills, with inflation forecast to hit 10 per cent and welfare payments and wages falling behind the increase in prices.  The Cabinet away-day was also arranged to discuss the Government's new legislative agenda, as set out in this week's Queen's Speech. The Parliamentary set-piece occasion drew criticism for failing to offer immediate support on the cost-of-living. Mr Sunak today reiterated that he would wait until the full impact of global energy price volatility is known, before acting. With the war in Ukraine continuing to exacerbate the worldwide energy crisis, it is expected that Ofgem will announce in August another huge hike in gas and electricity bills as Britain heads into autumn and winter. One energy boss this week predicted annual bills could soar close to PS3,000 when an increased price cap comes into force from October. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he 'stands ready' to do more to help households with their energy bills when the price cap is raised again. 'I've always said I stand ready to do more as we learn more about the situation,' he told Sky News. 'On energy prices in particular, the price cap protects people for some months to come. 'But I've said when we have a clearer picture about what happens with energy bills, we stand ready and I stand ready to support people further.' The Financial Times reported Mr Sunak was looking to announce a major new support package in August.  Ahead of the Cabinet day-trip, Mr Johnson said: 'I'm delighted to bring Cabinet to Stoke-on-Trent today - a city which is the beating heart of the ceramics industry and an example of the high skilled jobs that investment can bring to communities. 'This government is getting on with delivering the people's priorities and tackling the issues that matter most to the public.  'This week we've set out how we'll use new landmark legislation to grow our economy to address the cost of living, and level up opportunities for communities across the country.'", "ce6b71ca6df88cb6df9885863b8380fccdc0b93b62ab70ef07b29988": "Boris Johnson today stopped short of ruling out a windfall tax on energy giants despite insisting he 'doesn't like' the idea. The PM left the door open to a one-off levy after Rishi Sunak put the prospect 'on the table', ordering officials to work on the details.  Ministers had previously dismissed calls for a windfall tax to help ease the cost-of-living crisis, warning it could damage investment in energy infrastructure. But the Chancellor is said to be alarmed that industry giants have done little or nothing to increase their spending despite raking in enormous profits. Senior Tory MP Robert Halfon backed the move this morning, saying oil companies had been 'ripping off' motorists by not reducing pump prices when global costs fell.  He denied that the policy would be 'un-Conservative' - pointing out that Margaret Thatcher did it in 'time of need'.  It follows an admission by BP chief executive Bernard Looney, who said his firm's investment plans would not be affected by a windfall tax. In an interview with LBC, the Prime Minister said that, while he still does not like such taxes because of the impact on investment, it is something that will have to be considered. Pressed on Mr Looney's comments, Mr Johnson said: 'Well, you know, then we'll have to look (at) it.' However, he added: 'The disadvantage with those sorts of taxes is that they deter investment in the very things that they need to be investing in - new technology, in new energy supply. 'I don't like them. I didn't think they're the right thing. I don't think they're the right way forward. I want those companies to make big, big investments.'  Ministers were stunned by comments from BP chief Bernard Looney, who said his firm's investment plans would not be affected by a windfall tax. Mr Looney also described his company as a 'cash machine'. The idea of a tax grab is said to be 'back on the table' to help families with the cost of living crisis without pushing public borrowing even higher. One insider said that a one-off levy was a 'no-brainer if the chief executives themselves are saying they have no problem with it'. Mr Halfon labelled oil company bosses 'the new oligarchs' as he called on the Government to hit them with a windfall tax. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, the Education Select Committee chair said the Government had done 'a fair bit' to tackle the cost-of-living crisis but that families were still struggling with food and energy bills. Mr Halfon said: 'I do think that the Government should consider properly a windfall tax. 'Oil companies or oil bosses are the new oligarchs - one of them earning a salary over PS76million, getting a PS4.5million bonus.' Pressed on the oligarch claim, the Harlow MP pointed to 'the way oil companies are ripping off motorists at the pump by not reducing the price quickly when the oil price falls internationally'. Arguing that windfall taxes were not 'un-Conservative', Mr Halfon argued: 'Margaret Thatcher did it, David Cameron has done it, Conservative governments have imposed windfall tax on oil companies in times of need.' Mr Johnson will urge Cabinet members to 'bring the benefits of the Queen's Speech to life' as they meet for an away-day in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. Downing Street said ministers will discuss how the new legislation will boost the economy, improve living standards and level up opportunities across the country. Mr Johnson suggested that the Government will be coming forward with more assistance for hard-pressed families in July. Downing Street was forced to deny that ministers are preparing an emergency budget to deal with the cost-of-living crisis after the Prime Minister suggested in the Queen's Speech debate on Tuesday that there would be more help in the days to come. However, in his LBC interview, Mr Johnson indicated there would be additional support over the summer rather than waiting for the Budget in the autumn to act. 'There is more coming down the track. July and so on,' he said. 'But what we will do is use all the ingenuity and compassion that we have and the fiscal firepower that we have as a result of the strong economic growth we had coming out of the pandemic.

Coleen unfollowed Rebekah in January 2019 after a story about her car crashing in the US was leaked to the media, prompting her to suspect she was the 'snake in the grass' who was responsible.  In text messages between Rebekah and her agent Caroline Watt, Rebekah said she would like to contact Coleen and suggested 'saying something about' her sister Rosie, who died in 2013 aged 14 following a lifelong battle with a rare brain disorder.  Today, Coleen's barrister David Sherborne put it to Rebecca that she was going to 'use the anniversary' of Rooney's sister dying as 'the peg' to message her. Rebekah said: 'That's interpreted wrong'. In the event, Ms Watt suggested she use a different tack by saying she had recently been on Loose Women and the programme's booker asked if Coleen might want to appear on the show.      Rebekah entered the witness box for the third time today on what was expected to be the final day of her evidence.  In a viral social media post in October 2019, Coleen, 36, said she had carried out a 'sting operation' and accused Rebekah, 40, of leaking 'false stories' about her private life to the press. Rebekah, who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, denies leaking stories to the media and is suing her fellow footballer's wife for libel, while Coleen is defending the claim on the basis her post was 'substantially true'. Today's trial had to be adjourned for 10 minutes after Rebekah broke down in tears while being quizzed by Mr Sherborne.    It happened moments after the barrister was ticked off by the judge for continually making 'unnecessary' comments. Discussing a fake post by Coleen Rooney over gender selection, Rebekah said she had not been to Mexico for treatment after Mr Sherborne had mistakenly used her name instead of Coleen's. After her reply, Mr Sherborne said pointedly: 'Is that your best point Mrs Vardy?' Her barrister Hugh Tomlinson QC rose to his feet to intervene saying Mr Sherborne was 'constantly commenting and making remarks to the witness'. It led to the judge saying: 'It is unnecessary and there's not really enough time for those comments in any event.'

According to The Mirror, the Manchester United captain left the club's Carringdon training ground at midday and headed straight a registry office where Fern was waiting for him. Details of the wedding were kept top secret even from the guests as attendees were reportedly told the venue of Crewe Registry Office in a text earlier that day. Harry and Fern, both 29, met when they were teenagers and have been together for the last ten years. The couple, who have been engaged since 2018, kept details of the ceremony from all but their closest family and friends. The publication reports that they are planning to take their vows again this summer in a romantic ceremony in France.  Harry was said to have been joined at the ceremony by his parents Zoe and Alan, who travelled from their home near Sheffield. A source told the publication: 'It was a closely guarded secret to all but their closest family and friends.  'They wanted to be officially married in the UK before they head to France. That will be a fairytale wedding day for Fern.' Harry's sister Daisy, 21, will reportedly be a bridesmaid at the more lavish ceremony, set to be held at a chateau in Burgundy.  His brothers Joe, 30, and Laurence, 25, will also be in attendance along with his teammate Jordan Pickford - who's wife Megan Davison will reportedly be another bridesmaid.   It has been said that Fern is 'very excited' about getting married at such a romantic venue after ten years with Harry, and is busy planning the wedding. Fern and Harry have been dating since they were teenagers and met in their in hometown of Sheffield. The couple share two daughters, Lillie Saint, three, and Piper Rose, two.  Fern announced their engagement in February 2018, after Harry whisked her off to Paris. She penned at the time: 'On Saturday night, Harry made me the happiest girl in the world & asked me to marry him in the most perfect way [sic] #ISAIDYES #TheFutureMrsMaguire #17thFebruary2018'", "dda36909b8aa2dcbf51075e209e2cd0e2a5219967ba54bbcf2d1bd72": "Rebekah Vardy likened Coleen Rooney to a 'pigeon that s**ts' in your hair, the Wagatha Christie libel trial heard today - as the WAG broke down in tears twice while giving evidence. The comments, made in a 2019 interview with the Daily Mail, were read out to the High Court by Coleen's barrister David Sherborne.  Asked whether she ever argued with her rival, Rebekah told the interviewer: 'That would be like arguing with a pigeon. You can tell it that you are right and it is wrong, but it's still going to s**t in your hair.'   The Wagatha Christie case centres around a 2019 social media post by Coleen, 36, in which she said she had planted fake stories on her private Instagram account and accused Rebekah of leaking them to The Sun. Rebekah, 40, denies the claim, and launched a libel case when Coleen refused to take down the post.   The Daily Mail article resurfaced during a gruelling cross-examination during which the WAG broke down twice.   The first time, Rebekah had corrected Mr Sherborne after he confused her for Coleen, prompting him to reply, 'Is that your best point Mrs Vardy?'. After she began crying, her barrister Hugh Tomlinson QC rose to his feet to intervene, saying Mr Sherborne was 'constantly commenting and making remarks to the witness'. It led to the judge saying: 'It is unnecessary and there's not really enough time for those comments in any event.' Moments later the judge asked if Rebekah would like to take a break as she appeared distressed. She adjourned the hearing for 10 minutes to allow Rebekah to compose herself. In the second incident - less than half an hour later - Rebekah became emotional after she was questioned over a fake story posted by Coleen about a flood at her PS20million Cheshire home, which has been likened to a Morrisons supermarket.  Rebekah had told the court she had not seen Coleen's Instagram post, only for Mr Sherborne to remind her of a statement made two years ago when she admitted she had seen it. Becoming visibly upset, Rebekah's voice broke up as she said: 'There was a lot of abuse at the time.' Mr Sherborne told the court Coleen had restricted access to her followers as part of a 'social media sting', which revealed that Rebekah's account was the only one which had been sent the fake post. Rebekah also began crying yesterday after Mr Sherborne asked her about sick comments Twitter trolls had made about her two-year-old daughter.     Earlier today, the High Court heard how Rebekah received a text from her agent, Ms Watt, announcing 'it was me' after Coleen first publicly claimed that someone had been leaking stories from her private Instagram. Asked by Mr Sherborne why did not challenge her, Rebekah said it was because she had been 'watching Dancing on Ice' and was distracted by Gemma Collins's infamous 'face-plant'.   Among the key developments on day three of the gripping case - As the toxic feud between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy spilled out in public for a third day, here is a summary of the evidence as it was heard in court: Earlier today, Rebekah asked 'who's Davy Jones?' following a nautical reference by Mr Sherborne.  The High Court burst into laughter after the exchange - which concerned the claim that Rebekah's agent, Caroline Watt, lost her phone containing WhatsApp messages when it fell off a boat into the North Sea.  September 2017 to October 2019 - The Sun runs a number of articles about Coleen, including that she travelled to Mexico to look into baby 'gender selection' treatment, her plan to revive her TV career and the flooding of her basement. October 9, 2019 - Coleen uses social media to accuse Rebekah of selling stories from her private Instagram account to the tabloids. Coleen says she spent five months attempting to work out who was sharing information about her and her family based on posts she had made on her personal social media page. After sharing a series of 'false' stories and using a process of elimination, Coleen claims they were viewed by one Instagram account, belonging to Rebekah. Rebekah, then pregnant with her fifth child, denies the allegations and says various people had access to her Instagram over the years. She claims to be 'so upset' by Coleen's accusation, later adding: 'I thought she was my friend but she completely annihilated me.' The public dispute makes headlines around the world, with the hashtag #WagathaChristie trending. February 13, 2020 - In a tearful appearance on ITV's Loose Women, Rebekah says the stress of the dispute caused her to have severe anxiety attacks and she 'ended up in hospital three times'. Coleen says in a statement that she does not want to 'engage in further public debate'. June 23, 2020 - It emerges that Rebekah has launched libel proceedings against Coleen. Rebekah's lawyers allege she 'suffered extreme distress, hurt, anxiety and embarrassment as a result of the publication of the post and the events which followed'. November 19-20, 2020 - The libel battle has its first High Court hearing in London. A judge rules that Coleen's October 2019 post 'clearly identified' Rebekah as being 'guilty of the serious and consistent breach of trust'. Mr Justice Warby concludes that the 'natural and ordinary' meaning of the posts was that Rebekah had 'regularly and frequently abused her status as a trusted follower of Coleen's personal Instagram account by secretly informing The Sun of Coleen's private posts and stories'. February 8-9, 2022 - A series of explosive messages between Rebekah and her agent Caroline Watt - which Coleen's lawyers allege were about her - are revealed at a preliminary court hearing. The court is told Rebekah was not referring to Coleen when she called someone a 'nasty bitch' in one exchange with Ms Watt. Coleen's lawyers seek further information from the WhatsApp messages, but the court is told that Ms Watt's phone fell into the North Sea after a boat she was on hit a wave, before further information could be extracted from it. February 14 - Coleen is refused permission to bring a High Court claim against Ms Watt for misuse of private information to be heard alongside the libel battle. A High Court judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, says the bid was brought too late and previous opportunities to make the claim had not been taken. April 13 - Ms Watt is not fit to give oral evidence at the upcoming libel trial, the High Court is told as the case returns for another hearing. The agent revokes permission for her witness statement to be used, and withdraws her waiver which would have allowed Sun journalists to say whether she was a source of the allegedly leaked stories. April 29 - Rebekah 'appears to accept' that her agent was the source of allegedly leaked stories, Coleen's barrister David Sherborne tells the High Court. He argues that a new witness statement submitted by Rebekah suggests Ms Watt was the source but Rebekah claims she 'did not authorise or condone her'. Rebekah's lawyer Hugh Tomlinson says the statement did not contain 'any change whatever in the pleaded case', with her legal team having no communication with Ms Watt. May 10 onwards - The trial begins.   Mr Sherborne has accused Rebekah of deleting key evidence that, it is said, would prove that Rebekah had been leaking stories to the media.  'We know that Ms Watt's phone is now in Davy Jones' Locker, don't we, Mrs Vardy?' Mr Sherborne said.  Rebekah then replied: 'I'm sorry, I don't know who Davy Jones is'.  The judge then had to describe the idiom, which refers to the legendary resting place of sailors who have drowned at sea.  The incident came 24 hours after Rebekah herself had to explain to Mr Sherborne a rude term that appeared in one of her texts.  Asked by the barrister what the abbreviation 'FFS' meant in one message Rebekah glanced nervously at the judge, who indicated it was all right to swear in court when the evidence demanded it.  'For F**** sake', Rebekah said.  Rebekah Vardy was dramatically accused of lying today after she blamed heavy drinking for failing to remember the details of a 2018 World Cup paparazzi photo she allegedly helped to set up - as the Wagatha Christie libel trial entered its third day. She denied the allegation this morning. But when asked for details by barrister David Sherborne - acting for her rival Coleen Rooney - she said: 'If I'm completely honest I had been drinking quite a bit.' Mr Sherborne cuttingly replied: 'I would hope you're honest because you're sitting in a witness box.' He then added: 'Mrs Vardy, this is the first time that you have suggested that your recollection of events has been affected by drinking - that's a lie, isn't it?'    Today, the High Court heard how Rebekah received a text from her agent, Ms Watt, announcing 'it was me' after Coleen first publicly claimed that someone had been leaking stories from her private Instagram. Asked by Mr Sherborne why did not challenge her, Rebekah said it was because she had been 'watching Dancing on Ice' and was distracted by Gemma Collins's infamous 'face-plant'. In another bizarre exchange, the barrister referred to Ms Watt's claim that she had lost her phone after it had fallen off a boat into the North Sea. He said it was now 'lying at the bottom of the sea in Davy Jones' locker',' only for Rebekah to ask the court: 'Who is Davy Jones?' Early in today's session, Mr Sherborne quizzed Rebekah about a series of messages she exchanged with her agent which allegedly show them working together to organise the 2018 World Cup paparazzi photo. The group of WAGs in the snap included Marcus Rashford's girlfriend Lucia Loi, Kyle Walker's partner Annie Kilner and Harry Maguire's fiancee Fern Hawkins - who was left 'upset and embarrassed' when it emerged in the media. Rebekah said Ms Watt had arranged for a photographer to take pictures of her as she left her hotel but denied giving the photographer the location of either the hotel or the restaurant where the WAGs were having dinner. The court heard Rebekah texted Ms Watt about travel arrangements from the hotel to the restaurant. There were exchanges about last minute changes in travel arrangements on the night. Mr Sherborne suggested that a message to Ms Watt which said, 'I have bought about 10 minutes' referred to the fact Rebekah was delaying some of the women from posting a group photograph on social media because a photographer hiding in the bushes by the hotel had taken a picture of them all and they 'didn't want to lose their exclusive'. In response, Rebekah said, 'Well, it reads like that' but said she 'couldn't recall' the details due to the amount of alcohol she had consumed. 'The plans changed,' she added. 'I recall it may have been raining. No one wants to walk when they're dressed up in the rain.' Mr Sherborne accused Rebekah of changing her story about what happened and reminded her that she had signed a statement of truth when she made legal declarations, risking a contempt of court action if she lied. 'You can't get your story straight,' he said to her, adding that this was 'because you're lying'. Mr Sherborne asked Rebekah why she was 'pulling a face' when he said he was going to refer to a witness statement made by the FA's family liaison officer, Harpreet Robertson. Rebekah - who has claimed the representative took an instant dislike to her - said: 'Because it was Ms Robertson again.' Quoting from the statement, Mr Sherborne Ms Robertson said other members of the group and a member of the England squad were upset that they had been 'set up' as they were not looking to court publicity. Rebekah replied: 'This is the first that I've heard of it.'   Mr Sherborne referred to a story in which Rebekah was alleged to have confirmed that there was no sex ban within the England squad during the 2018 World Cup. The article in The Sun had the headline: 'Becky Vardy reveals the secret to England's World Cup success is down to the lads getting to spend time with their WAGs. It said England's successful run in the tournament was down to Gareth Southgate 'giving the lads the freedom to score - with their wives and girlfriends.' Rebekah is said to have hinted that sex hadn't been explicitly forbidden as 'there is no proof it hinders performance' The article featured an apparently naked Rebekah draped inna flag of St George. The article described Rebekah as the 'unofficial leader of the WAGs. Asked if those were her words Rebekah denied the saying of the journalist who wrote the story: 'No it was his and it's quite an embarrassing statement.' During his cross-examination Mr Sherborne accused Rebekah of 'having selective amnesia'.   Rebekah was unable to explain what had happened to nine months of messages she exchanged with her agent Ms Watt which have disappeared. He was referring to a period of time between October 15, 2019 and July 25 the following year. On July 20 2020 Rebekah received a legal letter from Coleen's lawyers which she said had been 'very threatening'. Asked what had happened to the message, Rebekah said: 'I can only imagine that I potentially switched phones during that period. I don't know. I can neither confirm nor deny.' The court heard that four months earlier Caroline Watt had lost her mobile phone when it fell into the sea when she was filming the coastline during a boat trip in Scotland. Rebekah today claimed she and her fellow WAGs had to wash their own clothes in the sink at their hotel during the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Rebekah was quizzed by Coleen's barrister Mr Sherborne about the extent of her contacts with journalists during the tournament.  In response, the WAG claimed she did not have any contact with the media because she was too busy washing her clothes in the sink. 'I was busy with the kids and under so much stress,' she said. 'We even had to wash our own clothes in the sink at the hotel.'   Rebekah allegedly 'used the anniversary of Coleen's sister's death as a peg to contact the WAG' after she unfollowed Jamie Vardy's wife on Instagram, the court heard. Coleen unfollowed Rebekah in January 2019 after a story about her car crashing in the US was leaked to the media, prompting her to suspect she was the 'snake in the grass' who was responsible.  In text messages between Rebekah and her agent Caroline Watt, Rebekah said she would like to contact Coleen and suggested 'saying something about' her sister Rosie, who died in 2013 aged 14 following a lifelong battle with a rare brain disorder.  Today, Coleen's barrister David Sherborne put it to Rebecca that she was going to 'use the anniversary' of Rooney's sister dying as 'the peg' to message her. Rebekah said: 'That's interpreted wrong'. In the event, Ms Watt suggested she use a different tack by saying she had recently been on Loose Women and the programme's booker asked if Coleen might want to appear on the show.      By Niomi Harris and Rebecca Davison for MailOnline He has managed to see the funny side after the size of his manhood was dragged into the Wagatha Christie court case after Rebekah Vardy compared it to a 'chipolata.' And on Thursday, Peter Andre, 49, took to Instagram to say that despite his positive stance, there would outrage if a man had made a similar slur about a woman's anatomy. He captioned a new video: 'Here I was this morning sat in my robe feeling like I had to say something. Feel free to come to your own conclusion. Just a couple of things first. Sorry to Emily and the children that have had to see and hear some not very nice things... You all know I like to take the p*** out of myself but maybe I felt a bit vulnerable this morning. Love from an Aussie Brit Greek.' In the video itself, he said: 'Hi everyone. Seeing as I haven't had much of a say in this, and just let everyone have a laugh and whatever, whatever, I'm just going to put it out.   Rebekah denied leaking information about Coleen's 2019 car crash in Washington DC to the media. Mr Sherborne quizzed Jamie Vardy's wife over an article in The Sun about how Coleen had narrowly escaped injury in a horror crash while husband Wayne was playing in the US. Coleen had posted a picture of her badly damaged Honda on her private Instagram account, the court heard. The story quoted a source who said: 'Coleen ended up having a bad smash when she was driving the family car. One side of the car was completely caved in. She couldn't drive it away and it looked like a total write off.' The day after the message was posted, Ms Watt sent a message to Rebekah saying: 'Am I imagining it or did you say yesterday that Coleen had crashed her Honda?' Rebekah replied: 'She defo has' - and instructed Ms Watt to go into Coleen's account. Ms Watt then sent another message saying: 'She must have taken whatever it is down as it's not there now.' Under cross-examination, Rebekah denied leaking the story.   An Instagram post from Coleen showed a photo of the damaged vehicle, which the court has been told about previously. 'RIP' and 'half a Honda', the post says. Mr Sherborne referred Rebekah to an article written in The Sun about the car crash. 'Coleen Rooney narrowly avoids injury in car crash and wrecks 4x4 just weeks after Wayne's arrest for 'public intoxication' in Washington,' the article, which was published on 25 January 2019, is headlined. DAY 1   ACCORDING TO TEAM VARDY  ACCORDING TO TEAM ROONEY  DAY 2  CLAIMS MADE DURING REBEKAH'S CROSS-EXAMINATION   Mr Sherborne brought up the text messages between Rebekah and Ms Watt about the crash, which took place on the 23 January. Ms Watt asked her about Coleen crashing the Honda and told her she could no longer see the Instagram post. 'I would have tried to have done a story on Coleen but the evidence has been deleted,' Ms Watt said in a message to Vardy, the court hears. The previous evening, Rebekah had been at the National Television Awards. She and Ms Watts were in a box hosted by The Sun, the court heard, and the journalist who wrote the car crash article a few days later, Andy Halls, was also there. Mr Sherborne accused Rebekah of changing her story on whether or not she knew Halls was there. In her witness statement submitted to the court, she said: 'Andy Halls may also have been there but I don't remember seeing him.' Referring to the texts between her and Ms Watts about the car crash, Rebekah said at one point: 'I wasn't paying that much attention, not at half past eight at night.' Mr Sherborne said: 'But you don't say to her it's half past eight and I want to watch my favourite show on TV, do you?' 'I don't really watch television,' said Rebekah.  Rebekah  agreed her agent 'appeared to be the source' of a news story on Coleen's 2019 car crash after the agent admitted 'it was me' in a text message. Rebekah was referring to the moment the celebrity tripped and fell face-first on the ice during one of the routines in the ITV show.  Coleen's lawyer David Sherborne read out two Instagram posts by his client in London's High Court about The Sun's article in the months before she embarked on her 'Wagatha Christie' investigation. In a public post, Coleen wrote: 'Someone on my private Instagram seen the picture and is telling or selling stories to a certain newspaper. It's happened several times now over the past couple of years. It's sad to think someone who I have accepted to follow me is betraying for either money or to keep a relationship with the press.' Mr Sherborne then took Rebekah to further texts sent between herself and her agent Ms Watt. 'Such a victim. Poor Coleen,' Ms Watt said to Rebekah at about 6.28pm on January 27, 2019. Just under 20 minutes later, she sent another message. 'And it wasn't someone she trusted. It was me'. Rebekah told the court: 'That seems to be what she's saying.' She said she didn't replying, adding 'at 6.35 I would have been bathing my children' at the time the message was sent. The court then heard that Rebekah allegedly tried to throw Coleen 'off the scent' with 'disingenuous messages' to her suggesting her account might have been hacked by journalists. Rebekah told Coleen in a private message: 'Oh my God. What the f*** is wrong with people. Why have they taken that one of you and the kids and not of Wayne in bed? That would have been an even better one in their eyes. D***heads. Hope you are OK.'  Mr Sherborne suggested Rebekah sent the message as she 'knew the finger of suspicion' was going to be pointed at her. Her message continued: 'That is so bad! And The Sun of all people as well! Have you been through all your followers? No one with any celeb mag links? What about being hacked? I would be chomping if that was me! Not on at all.' 'This was totally disingenuous, Mrs Vardy,' Mr Sherborne said. 'You knew perfectly well that you had been the source of this story through Caroline Watt but you presented yourself to her as someone who hates the Sun. You're trying to throw Mrs Rooney off the scent, aren't you?' 'I don't hate the Sun', Rebekah interjected. 'But you knew Mrs Rooney did,' Mr Sherborne said, and Rebekah agreed. The trial continues.    Rebekah allegedly tried to throw Coleen Rooney 'off the scent' with 'disingenuous messages' to her suggesting her account might have been hacked by journalists, the High Court heard. The WAG told Coleen in a private message: 'Oh my God. What the f*** is wrong with people. Why have they taken that one of you and the kids and not of Wayne in bed? That would have been an even better one in their eyes. D***heads. Hope you are OK.' Coleen's lawyer Mr Sherborne suggested Rebekah sent the message as she 'knew the finger of suspicion' was going to be pointed at her. Her message continued: 'That is so bad! And The Sun of all people as well! Have you been through all your followers? No one with any celeb mag links? What about being hacked? I would be chomping if that was me! Not on at all.' 'This was totally disingenuous, Mrs Vardy,' Mr Sherborne said. 'You knew perfectly well that you had been the source of this story through Caroline Watt but you presented yourself to her as someone who hates the Sun. You're trying to throw Mrs Rooney off the scent, aren't you?' 'I don't hate the Sun', Rebekah interjected. 'But you knew Mrs Rooney did,' Mr Sherborne said, and Rebekah agreed.  Mr Sherborne asked Rebekah about the 'Secret WAG' column launched in September 2019. He outlined how the paper had signed up 'a real life Premier League WAG with a front-row seat to the debauched world of English football'. It said the 'explosive' new column was arriving 'with a bang' and promised to 'send shockwaves through the beautiful game'. It promised revelations of 'a wild Premier League threesome' and 'a shocking drugs scandal'. 'The Secret WAG's identity is not even known to her superstar husband. So pull up a chair and see what really goes on when the big names think nobody is looking.' Mr Sherborne went on to highlight Secret WAG revelations about the ex wife of Jamie Vardy's former teammate Riyad Mahrez and the wife of former England goalkeeper Kim Hart.  Reading from another Secret Wag revelation, Mr Sherborne said: 'There were a couple of Chelsea players who actually clubbed together for a flat near the training ground so they could keep their mistresses there. 'They had it in somebody else's name so nobody - especially their wives - would find out about it. If they finished training early they would go round and see the girls for a quick bunk up. 'Some of these women would even 'service' a couple of the other players too. Vile. No glam nights out but sex on tap for the married players and a free home for the girls.' Mr Sherborne said another revelation referred to 'a player at a club in the Midlands who has secretly fathered other children with women and his wife hasn't got a clue.' Another story in the column referred to a 'pretty brunette' who had agreed to having threesomes with her husband and 'told all the players in the dressing room about it.' Mr Sherborne said the article alleged: 'It all went wrong when she brought back the wife of a former team-mate.' The court heard TV personality Danielle Lloyd,the ex-wife of former Premier League star Jamie O'Hara, thought Vardy was involved in the column. Rebekah denies being the Secret Wag or being involved in the column, And she said the WAGs mentioned in the column were not part of her 'circle'. She said: 'My circle would be people I socialise with or people I have regular contact with. Some of these people I have met. Team Rooney vs Team Vardy! Rebekah is supported by crisis manager who's an expert in online reputation and a VERY burly bodyguard in Jamie's absence - while Coleen has Hollywood's favourite barrister By Bridie Pearson-Jones for MailOnline  Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy have enlisted some of the country's finest media experts and legal minds as they go head to head in the celebrity trial of the decade. Yesterday was the second instalment of the PS3million 'Wagatha Christie' libel trial between the two footballer's wives which  featured a tearful appearance in the witness box, Whatsapp 'gossip' about a mystery celebrity affair and yet more foul-mouthed text messages - all brought to an end by a fittingly dramatic fire alarm. Coleen publicly 'outed' her fellow WAG when she accused her of sharing three fake stories she had posted on her personal Instagram with The Sun as part of what she described as a social media 'sting' operation. Rebekah vehemently denied the allegation - leading her to launch the pricey legal action which saw its second day on Wednesday. While Tuesday's hearing dredged up Peter Andre's alleged 'chipolata' manhood, yesterday focused on Rebekah's relationship with her agent Caroline Watt. In the Vardy corner is Hacked Off founder Hugh Tomlinson QC - as well as two glamorous members of the legal team, including one who was once named one of the 'sexiest lawyers' in the UK, and another who is a crisis manager who's experienced in online reputation. Vardy has also appeared alongside a security guard - whereas Coleen doesn't appear to have any bodyguard by her when entering court. Meanwhile, Coleen has been joined in court by her football superstar husband Wayne as well as Hollywood's favourite lawyer  David Sherborne and rising legal mind Ben Hamer.

He was one of several lawyers representing Russian oligarchs whose ethics were questioned in parliament by the Conservative MP Bob Seely following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The lawyer was on the side of Jeremy Clarkson's ex-wife Alex Hall when he tried to - but dropped - efforts to stop her claiming they had an affair during his later marriage. He also successfully represented Prince Charles as the royal sought to stop the publishing of his Hong Kong travel diaries, saying public interest justifications were 'far-fetched'. And in an earlier case, he won substantial damages for Christopher Jefferies after press coverage incorrectly associated him with the murder of his tenant Joanna Yeates in 2010. A year later he co-founded Hacked Off, the group campaigning for tighter media regulation, which he now chairs, and which has backers such as Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan. Tomlinson was born in Woodhouse in Leeds where he went to Leeds Grammar School and then Balliol College, Oxford, leaving with the top first in PPE. He then took up philosophical studies at Sussex University before going to the University of Paris in 1977. In 2000 he was a founding member of Matrix Chambers in London.  Security   Rebekah  has also been seen going into court accompanied by a burly security guard - whereas Coleen doesn't appear to have any bodyguard alongside her. She's previously discussed how security is important to her and added that she's faced threats since her feud with Coleen went public.  She told OK! magazine ahead of the 2018 World Cup that she and her family were bringing their own security to the games. Nicola McLean  Fellow WAG Nicola McLean has seemingly thrown her support behind Mrs Vardy several times - once stating that Mrs Rooney is 'not as private' as she is considered while also insisting Mrs Vardy is not interested in the fame game. Nicola is married to Tom Williams, who now plays for Hashtag United of the Essex Senior League. Tom is a defender and midfielder and made nearly 300 appearances in the Football League playing for numerous clubs, including QPR and West Ham. The I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here star, who has been married to Tom since 2009, told Closer Magazine in 2020: 'I've had different experiences at different clubs but the WAG world can be a b****y mean girls like existence... 'There can be rivalry and unfriendliness with someone in the group and the top dog and there can be a lot of drama. It isn't just amazing holidays and designer clothes there can be a lot of behind-the-scenes politics between the girls.' On some of the most famous WAGS, she went on: 'A lot of women want to emulate Victoria Beckham, Alex Gerrard, Elen Rivas - they dine out on the fact they're a WAG and it can consume you.' Nicola then pointed out that it is not all it seems with Mrs Vardy and Mrs Rooney: 'I know some WAGs will only be interested in the hierarchy, fame and drama but I don't believe Rebekah is like that. She's not fussed about the press or limelight. 'Everyone thinks Coleen is really private - but remember she's done countless interviews, books and even her own TV show.' Caroline Watt  Mrs Vardy's friend and agent, Ms Watt has featured in some of the preliminary hearings, despite not being a party to the claim or giving evidence at the trial. She is a former Virgin Atlantic air hostess who has been Rebekah's agent for the past seven years, helping to build her profile in the national media. Reports that she no longer represents her following the current controversy engulfing the two have been dismissed as inaccurate with Ms Watt remaining close to Ms Vardy both professionally and personally. Ms Watt, 39, is married to former footballer Steve Watt, who played briefly for Chelsea, making one Premier League appearance for two minutes in 2005 and Swansea City. He is currently manager of Kent non-league side Hythe Town and they have two children. After leaving the airline industry, Ms Watt began working as an agent in the world of entertainment, quickly developing a reputation for her communication skills and ability to network. She was formerly employed by talent agency The Frontrow Partnership but left in 2019 to go it alone and took her main client and close friend, Ms Vardy with her. Ms Watt has been credited with building Ms Vardy's public profile by ensuring that she regularly featured in the national media and also brokered the deal for her to appear on the hit reality TV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2018. Ms Watt started representing the high-profile WAG in 2015, when her husband, Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy shot to fame. She is a regular visitor to the Vardy's Lincolnshire home and also socialises with Ms Vardy, attending glitzy parties and bars. Her other clients include the former Page 3 girl Nicola McLean but it is Ms Vardy that has been the biggest asset in her career as an agent. TEAM ROONEY  David Sherborne   Unlike Rebekah, Coleen arrived at court with just her husband and not an entourage of lawyers. However, her legal team is just as impressive and versed in the world of celebrity as her fellow WAG's. David Sherborne, 53, who has been dubbed one of Hollywood's favourite lawyers, is acting for Mrs Rooney. He was lead counsel for victims of press intrusion in the Leveson inquiry, and represented Johnny Depp in his libel suit against The Sun. In November 2020, the High Court ruled that Depp had lost his case. In September 2020, Sherborne was dropped from the Duchess of Sussex's legal team in her case against The Mail on Sunday following an early setback. Sherborne's previous clients also include Princess Diana, Melania Trump, Sir Paul McCartney, Sienna Miller, Kate Moss and Harry Styles. His father was a QC, but while he comes from a legal family, he is seen as a 'rebel' in many ways due to his apparent fondness for the limelight. A former colleague told The Times: 'He likes to present a fun, outgoing persona and is very limelight-seeking. All the other barristers in chambers were hyper-critical of him breaking the rules.' While he's known for rubbing shoulders with A-listers, Tattler and Evening Standard both commented he is 'so handsome'  he could be a celebrity himself. The twice-married barrister was revealed to be having an affair with a member of Lord Leveson's junior counsel, Carine Patry Hoskins in 2013-. Ms Hoskins, dubbed the 'thinking man's Pippa Middleton' -was Lord Leveson's number two, while Mr Sherborne was defending Hugh Grant and other hacking  victims. Ben Hamer There was a rare moment of light relief amidst the morning's fierce cross-examination when Mr Sherborne mentioned that his junior, Ben Hamer, 29,  was 'very adept at searching online through social media on his phone.' Rebekah shot back, without smiling: 'I know, Mr Hamer follows me on Twitter' to laughter in the court. But this isn't Ben's first celebrity case. He's previously  Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard  and acted for the claimant in Blackledge v Person(s) Unknown where libel and harassment damages of PS70,000 were awarded against the Defendant.  The Durham University graduate was first called to the Bar in 2017 at Lincoln's Inn, where he was a Lord Bowen and Lord Denning scholar. Very accomplished at a young age, he's previously was presented with the Benjamin Franklin House Literary Prize for his work on free speech and fake news.  He now provides pre-publication advice to various publications such as The Times and The Sunday Times as well as HarperCollins and Bloomsbury publishers. He is security cleared to SC level. Ben began as a tenant at 5RB after successful completion of pupillage at Chambers. His supervisors were Adam Wolanski QC, Jonathan Barnes QC, Richard Munden and Adam Speker QC. Ben was called to the Bar in 2017 at Lincoln's Inn, where he was a Lord Bowen and Lord Denning scholar. In 2017, Ben was presented with the Benjamin Franklin House Literary Prize, run in conjunction with the Daily Telegraph, for his writing on free speech, social media and 'fake news'. As an undergraduate, he edited Palatinate, where he won the Hunter Davies Prize for Student Journalism. Mrs Justice Steyn The High Court judge overseeing the case, Mrs Justice Steyn (pictured right) was appointed in 2019 and sits in the Queen's Bench Division - the part of the High Court which deals with defamation, personal injury and breach of contract claims. As well as overseeing the 'Wagatha Christie' claim, other prominent cases she has heard include Arron Banks' libel claim against journalist Carole Cadwalladr and the FDA union's unsuccessful legal challenge over Boris Johnson's decision to support Priti Patel following bullying accusations. The daughter of former Law Lord Lord Steyn, Mrs Justice Steyn covered a variety of cases as a barrister, including a case over the expansion of Heathrow airport.    WAYNE ROONEY Coleen has been joined in court by supportive husband Wayne, with whom she shares four children, while Jamie Vardy is yet to be pictured in court. Wayne, who has been with Coleen since the age of 16, last played with Jamie for England in 2016. Both husbands have kept mostly quiet on the clash, however Wayne did note in his Sunday Times column before last year's European championships that he would have drafted Jamie Vardy into the England team. He added: 'Some people may be surprised at this, especially with the legal case between my wife and Jamie's wife.' The former Premier League and England striker will take to the witness stand at London's High Court where he will be questioned under oath over how much he knew about his wife's 'Wagatha Christie' investigation. A source close to the case told MailOnline: 'Wayne is 100 per cent going into the witness box and this is just going to add to the drama of the whole occasion. Hugh Tomlinson is a very experienced barrister, and this could be one of the toughest opponents Wayne has ever faced. 'Rebekah's lawyers are adamant that he should be cross examined under oath about how much he knew about what Coleen was getting up to and that the truth will emerge.' Ms Rooney has always maintained that nobody was aware of her 'sting operation' when she decided to post a number of fake Instagram stories and eventually limit who could see them to just Ms Vardy. Three of these were later published in The Sun and are at the centre of the sensational libel battle. But Ms Vardy's lawyers insist that several people could have been the source of the leaks and that Ms Rooney told Wayne and others about what she was getting up to while also sharing details of the false posts with them. In addition to giving evidence, Wayne, the former Manchester United striker who is currently manager of Derby County, is also expected to accompany his wife when she attends the High Court for the trial, which is expected to last a week. Meanwhile, when Rebekah furiously denied the allegation in a lengthy Twitter statement, her husband showed his support by liking her post.  OTHER WAGS  Mrs Rooney thanked her fans and said there 'are a lot of really good people' in the world in an Instagram story in February 2022. And along with her devoted fans, the WAG has also been publicly supported by Danielle Lloyd, who came forth with similar claims about Mrs Vardy leading to a row between the duo on social media in 2019. Mrs Lloyd made a thinly-veiled dig at Mrs Vardy after weighing in on the Mrs Rooney row during an episode of This Morning. The TV personality detailed her 'similar run-ins' with the footballer's wife, before Mrs Vardy claimed Mrs Lloyd was only upset because she didn't 'recruit' one of Jamie's footballer pals for her after her divorce from Jamie O'Hara This came amid reports that many of the WAGs had distanced themselves from Mrs Vardy at the time and were busy 'scrutinising' past conversations with her, following the fallout from her feud with Mrs Rooney. Following Mrs Lloyd's appearance on This Morning, Mrs Vardy was quick to retaliate, as she took to Twitter to claim that the TV personality's admission was 'utter b******s' and their feud was sparked by her refusal to try and find Mrs Lloyd a man following her split from Jamie [O'Hara]. She wrote: 'Danielle Lloyd making false claims on @thismorning that we have had 'similar run-ins' is utter b****cks. She is just fuming that I 'didn't get Jamie recruiting' for her like she asked me to...'  ", "9d41df38242d24e0dc29f23b64e5665bc111dbe6b5daa23b9b4f9bba": "Boris Johnson floundered on the price of nappies today despite having seven children - as he ordered Cabinet to find 'radical' cost-of-living cures during an away-day in Stoke. The PM told ministers gathered at a pottery that they must use 'all our ingenuity, all our compassion' to find ways of helping Britons. But while the government is looking at cost-neutral measures such as two-yearly MoTs and loosening childcare regulations, Rishi Sunak appears determined to defy mounting Tory anxiety by holding off extra spending until the situation becomes clearer in August. The scale of the problems were underlined today as official figures showed UK plc growing less than expected in the first quarter - and going into reverse in March with a 0.1 per cent fall.  GDP rose by 0.8 per cent between January and March, down from growth of 1.3 per cent in the previous three months, and lower than the 1 per cent pencilled in by analysts. Worryingly, the figure was less than the 0.9 per cent that the Bank of England predicted for Q1 just a week ago - suggesting that the country is on an even worse path than those grim forecasts.  Mr Johnson is facing increasing demands for tax cuts and other action to ease the squeeze on households, and he endured an uncomfortable test of how in-touch he is during an LBC interview.   With a five-month-old baby at home, Mr Johnson was asked about the price of a 24-pack of nappies at Boots. But the Conservative Party leader, who has two small children and at least five others - merely replied that he was 'not going to get into' such questions. He gave the same answer when pressed on the current level of the energy price cap after its 54 per cent rise in April. Failing to give the correct figure of PS1,971 for the average household, Mr Johnson insisted: 'I'm going to tell you that what we do is make sure that we help people with all their weekly outgoings.'  The Government should act before the summer to tackle the cost of living, the boss of John Lewis has said. Sharon White called on ministers to take the same 'decisive action' seen during the coronavirus pandemic amid rising energy prices. Speaking on Peston, which airs at 10.45pm on ITV, Ms White said: 'I think the time absolutely has come for action, whether it's an emergency budget or whether it's another vehicle. 'As I say, I think we're all really nervous about what's going to happen in October, so when energy bills potentially go up again by up to PS1,000, it's winter.' Asked if she wanted action now, she said: 'I do, I think there ought to be action before the summer, so the decisive action that we saw - I thought the Government did incredibly well at pace and scale during Covid - I think we need to see the same decisive action taken at speed and at pace because otherwise... those are impacts across millions of households right across the country.' Ms White said action should be taken even if it means a temporary hit to public finances. Households have seen soaring energy bills, with inflation forecast to hit 10 per cent and welfare payments and wages falling behind the increase in prices.  In his opening remarks during the Cabinet meeting at a pottery in Stoke, the PM said: 'We're going to make sure we use all our ingenuity, all our compassion, everything we need to do to help people through the difficult aftershocks of Covid, and the inflationary pressures that we're seeing, particularly on the costs of energy. He added this week's Queen's Speech had given ministers 'the legislative firepower to deliver on tackling the underlying issues - the things that are driving up prices, particularly for energy, for people's transport, for the education people need. 'That is why I think the Queen's Speech is so important - infrastructure, education, technology - those are the things that we need to focus on - particularly cutting the cost of energy.' Mr Johnson urged ministers to show 'no lack of resource and compassion now - we're going to have be very, very committed, very, very radical, very, very forward-thinking - but stick to the basics of our thinking about getting people into high wage, high-skilled jobs'. 'Folks, we're going to get through this, it's going to take a lot of focus - but jobs, jobs, jobs is the answer - that is how we will unite and level up across the whole country, and get on with delivering on the mandate that the people gave us two-and-a-half years ago,' he continued. As they arrived at the Cabinet meeting, ministers were tight-lipped about the revelation that more than 100 fines have now been dished out to people working in Downing Street for Partygate breaches of Covid laws. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said she was 'too busy trying to make sure my heels don't fall through the cracks' of the cobbles on the site when asked about the latest batch of Covid fines. There is already huge pressure on Mr Sunak and his Treasury team to come up with another package of support for stuggling households. The Chancellor today offered a strong hint that more help could come in August when the energy regulator once again updates the energy price cap. But, despite the prospect of additional Government action to come this summer, it means Britons still face many more weeks without extra support. The government is also in limbo over whether to impose a windfall tax on energy firms' huge profits - with the option now back on the table after initially being ruled out.   A senior Tory MP has warned that the Conservatives will be punished unless they return to the philosophy of 'less state, low taxes and sound public finances'. South Dorset MP Richard Drax told the Commons: 'Unbelievably, we, the Conservative Party, are presiding over the steepest taxes since the 1940s and the highest sustained spending levels since the 1970s. This is not the Conservative way. Nor is it the way to cope with a struggling economy.' He went on: 'This week, the Bank of England warned of impending recession and 10% interest rates driven by high energy prices. These are difficult times. 'But every cloud has a silver lining. And, as Conservatives, this is the time to be radical, to return to our vote-winning philosophy of less state, low taxes and sound public finances.' Mr Drax said the Chancellor must fulfil his role but the promise of tax cuts in two years will be 'too little, too late', adding: 'We will have lost the electorate, who burdened by high taxes and debt will turn to a ruinous socialist government. One possibly in coalition with the SNP, the ultimate nightmare scenario. 'I accept that legislation on its own cannot solve the cost-of-living crisis, which, to a large extent, has been caused by events outside the Government's control. But we do have the power to cancel the increase in national insurance. Remove VAT from domestic fuel and reduce fuel duty even further.' The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed activity dipped 0.1 per cent month-on-month in March, with revised figures showing zero progress in February. Although the economy remains above pre-pandemic levels, the Bank of England has cautioned that the situation is deteriorating fast with inflation tracking towards 10 per cent and unemployment set to rise. As John Lewis joined calls for government to do more to help with the cost-of-living crisis, Mr Sunak tried to put a brave face on the data - saying growth in the quarter as a whole was still faster than the US, Germany and Italy.  'But I know these are still anxious times,' he said. 'Our recovery is being disrupted by Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine and other global challenges but we are continuing to help people where we can. 'Growth is the best way to help families in the longer-term so as well as easing immediate pressures on households and businesses, we are investing in capital, people and ideas to boost living standards in the future.' In interviews, Mr Sunak said he 'stands ready' to do more to help households with their energy bills when the price cap is increased again in October. 'I've always said I stand ready to do more as we learn more about the situation,' he told Sky News. 'On energy prices in particular, the price cap protects people for some months to come. 'But I've said when we have a clearer picture about what happens with energy bills, we stand ready and I stand ready to support people further.' Pushed on why he is waiting, Mr Sunak said the Government announced PS150 of council tax rebate for many households in February, and PS200 off energy bills in October - a sum that will need to be paid back. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), said: 'The UK economy grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and is now clearly above pre-pandemic levels, although growth in the latest three months was the lowest for a year. 'This was driven by growth in a number of service sectors as the economy continued to recover from Covid-19 effects, including hospitality, transport, employment agencies and travel agencies. There was also strong growth in IT.' He added: 'Our latest monthly estimates show GDP (gross domestic product) fell a little in March, with drops in both services and in production. 'Construction, though, saw a strong month, thanks partly to repair work after the February storms.' James Smith, Research Director at the Resolution Foundation, said: 'The UK started the year with a rapid recovery from the pandemic. But the economy already appears to be losing momentum as the cost of living crisis intensifies and the risk of stagflation looms. 'The economy contracted in March amid rising inflation and falling incomes. With consumer confidence at historic lows and inflation forecast to rise to double digit levels later this year, causing average pay packets to fall by PS1,200, there is a clear risk that we slide into recession. 'The Government can't shield everyone from all of its impact, but it should provide further targeted support to the low-and-middle income households who will be worst affected.' Small businesses also pointed to the scale of looming problems.     Dave Kelly, co-founder of Bristol-based butcher Ruby & White, said: 'Right now, it feels like the UK economy is headed for the slaughterhouse. Inflation, soaring energy bills, tax and interest rate rises are crippling households around the country.  'Worst of all, it feels like the Government is watching on and doing nothing. For us, sales are still holding up for now but we are seeing slightly more people order cheaper cuts.'  Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves reiterated calls for an emergency Budget. She said: 'Today's GDP figures will add to the worries families already face as prices soar and pay packets are crunched. 'That the Chancellor ignored serious warnings undermines any claim he couldn't have done more to protect the British economy from soaring inflation. 'The Government's Queen's Speech this week was out of ideas and out of touch, devoid of any real economic plan for growth or to tackle the cost of living crisis.' Last week the Bank of England warned families to brace for a bleak Christmas with the cost-of-living crisis set to reach an agonising climax at the end of this year - and potentially drag the country into recession for the second time in barely three years. Governor Andrew Bailey laid out the storm clouds that are gathering over the UK, with CPI inflation now expected to peak at 10 per cent - the highest level since 1982 - in the last quarter when the energy cap soars again. In a brutal hit on families, GDP is projected to plunge by around 0.9 per cent over those three months - and will be in the red through 2023 as a whole, declining by 0.25 per cent.  The Bank suggested the country will avoid a technical recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of falling activity - but experts warned the risk is 'intensifying'. UK plc has barely clawed back the ground from the Covid-triggered downturn in 2020, which was the biggest in a century.  In a desperate bid to control rampant inflation, the Bank pushed up interest rates once more despite the danger of choking what little growth is left.  The 0.25 percentage point hike took them to a 13-year high of 1 per cent, adding to the mortgage burden for many Britons already struggling to cope with the cost-of-living crisis. It is the fourth increase the Monetary Policy Committee has ordered since December.  The Bank admitted that the balance of risk on inflation is still that it could be even higher than anticipated, with the shock bigger than the oil crisis of the 1970s but not  lasting as long.", "711bcac8b1da5377e02c9126b10b1024c9de3b9c0370d2335470d37a": "More than different 100 types of cooked chicken products could contain salmonella, health officials have today warned, as Co-Op, Amazon, Costa and Starbucks became the latest big name food chains to be impacted by the contamination scare. Officials at the Food Standards Agency (UKFSA) have today released a comprehensive list of products believed to have been caught up in the contamination scare, which follows an outbreak at the gigantic Cranswick food processing plant in Hull. Shops and supermarkets including Pret, Sainsbury's, Aldi, Leon, M&S and Waitrose have stopped selling some some or all cooked poultry products due to the scare, which has seen chicken sandwiches, salads, wraps and ready meals pulled from the shelves or snatched from shoppers' hands in some cases. Tesco earlier today released a list of cooked poultry products it warns could be impacted by the outbreak at the gigantic Cranswick food processing plant in Hull.  Tesco's list of 14 items includes plain chicken breast slices, BBQ breast pieces and flame grilled chicken thins.   Salmonella is a type of bacterial infection often described simply as 'food poisoning'. Salmonella bacteria live in the gut of farm animals and is shed through their stool. Most people become infected by consuming food or water that has been contaminated by feces.  It is most common in raw meat, poultry, seafood and eggs because the cooking process kills off the bugs. Faeces may get onto raw meat and poultry during the butchering process, while seafood may be contaminated if harvested from contaminated water. Contamination can also happen when food is prepared by people who don't wash their hands thoroughly after using the toilet, changing a nappy or  handling contaminated food themselves. Symptoms include:  Most people develop the above symptoms within eight to 72 hours after exposure and recover within a few days to a week. Doctors advise taking in lots of fluids, such as water or squash, to avoid dehydration.  Life-threatening complications also may develop if the infection spreads beyond the intestines. About one in 2,500 people who get salmonella die from the infection. When to see a doctor: Now UKFSA has released a full list of products being recalled by Cranswick across 12 different brands, including supermarkets, coffee shops and convenience stores. Alongside Tesco, Aldi and Sainsbury's, who had already released their own list, UKFSA have also listed products from Amazon, which has recently started expanding its convenience store brand Amazon Fresh, Costa, Starbucks and One Stop. Cranswick, which bills itself as a producer of 160 tonnes a day of gourmet cooked chicken for sandwiches and meals, says the salmonella was detected during a 'routine internal inspection'.  The products feared to be contaminated appear to have use by dates of May 11, 12 and 13, and tonnes of food have now been seized and binned.  The Food Standards Agency has advised people with products in the fridge not to eat them. In its statement, UKFSA said: 'Cranswick Country Foods are recalling several products containing chicken because salmonella has been found in some of the chicken used to manufacture these products.  'As a precaution additional products are also being recalled whilst investigations continue.' It is not yet clear if anyone has been made ill by the bug, which kicks in between six hours to six days after infection.  It causes diarrhoea, fever, and stomach cramps and in severe cases can cause hospitalisation. Around 50 people die each year in the UK. A spokesman for Cranswick, which makes the majority of supermarket own brand sausages but fairly recently moved into chicken said: 'As a precautionary measure, we have asked our customers to remove any of their products containing our ready to eat chicken produced during the affected period.  'We are working closely with the Foods Standards Agency and will collaborate with their experts to resolve the matter', adding that its factory 'will remain closed until the investigations are complete'. The mass pulling of chicken products shows how exposed the UK food chain is to a handful of huge suppliers.  MailOnline has visited several supermarkets and food stores today where shelves usually piled high with chicken salads and sandwiches were bare or closed off. One Pret store in Kensington had removed all labels for its poultry products, with staff saying they were 'all gone'. A nearby M&S is continuing to sell chicken and sweetcorn and chicken and avocado sandwiches, but its chicken and bacon and chicken and salad ones have been pulled, leaving an empty shelf.  Yesterday it emerged that one Sainsbury's customer tried to buy some of the chicken but had it snatched from them by a woman at the till. Waitrose last night became the latest supermarket giant recalling some of its chicken sandwich range due to a potential salmonella risk amid a growing High Street poultry crisis.  Waitrose is recalling all of the below products with a use by date up to and including 14 May due to the potential presence of Salmonella, which may cause illness if consumed.   The move came as Pret A Manger removed all the chicken items on its menu, Aldi recalled its chicken and bacon Caesar wraps and Sainsburys took action on its cooked chicken offering.  Waitrose took the decision as a 'precautionary measure' and urged customers not to eat the sandwiches and wraps.  'We're recalling 10 of our Waitrose chicken sandwich and wrap lines -- with Use By dates up to and including 14 May -- due to a potential Salmonella risk,' a spokesperson told MailOnline. 'Customers should not consume these items and should return them to us for a full refund. We are very sorry for the inconvenience.' Those being recalled include the Waitrose Roast Chicken Salad with Salad Cream Sandwich; Roast Chicken & Stuffing Sandwich; Essential Chicken Mayo Sandwich and Waitrose Chicken & Bacon Caesar Wrap. The issue is thought to be due to an issue from a supplier.  Marks & Spencer is also now issuing a 'precautionary recall' of several chicken products due to the possibility a small number of them may contain salmonella. A Sainsbury's spokesperson said in a Tweet: 'We are recalling the majority of Sainsbury's and Taste the Difference chicken sandwiches, chicken wraps, chicken sandwich platters and some of our cooked chicken.' It was described as a precautionary measure, with the supermarket chain adding: 'Our supplier has alerted us that salmonella has been detected in some batches of cooked chicken.' M&S said in a notice on their website: they were recalling 12 food products 'given a small number of products may contain Salmonella.' The items include the Coronation Chicken Deli Filler; 14 piece classic sandwich platter; Classic mini roll selection; Chicken & Bacon Caesar Wrap; Made Without Wheat Gluten Free Chicken & Bacon Sandwich and the Roast Chicken & Bacon Sandwich. Pret also took the 'precautionary measure' to removed the chicken items 'due to a potential food safety risk at a supplier'.  The chain previously advertised a Sriracha Chicken Salad Wrap for its new menu but the item does not currently appear on its website. Marks & Spencer has recalled the following items:      Previous staples including the Chicken Caesar baguette are also not available, with a notice saying 'Oops, this product is currently not in our shops'. A Pret A Manger spokesperson told MailOnline: 'As a precautionary measure, we've temporarily removed the majority of chicken items on our menu due to a potential food safety risk at one of our suppliers.  'We hope to have these products back in shops soon. We apologise for any inconvenience.'    A spokesperson for LEON Restaurants also told MailOnline: 'We are aware of a recent incident regarding one of our suppliers, which is affecting a number of other food brands and retailers.  'As soon as we became aware of this, we quickly and proactively removed all chicken dishes from our restaurants as a precaution.  'Once we have total reassurance, we will bring back our full range, and we thank our guests for their patience. If anyone has any questions, they are able to contact us on hello@leon.co' Waitrose's and Pret's issues have been linked to Aldi, which had to recall its chicken and bacon Caesar wraps over salmonella fears and Sainsbury's, where customers reports being 'blocked' from buying chicken.  Anyone with the Aldi items in their fridge is being advised not to eat them by the Food Standards Agency. They are instead being asked to return them to the nearest store for a full refund. The Eat + Go chicken and bacon Caesar wrap and triple wrap are both affected. The items contaminated have use by dates of May 11 and May 12. Meanwhile, Brits took to social media to report chicken being removed from Sainsbury's branches.  One said: 'Tried to buy cooked chicken at @sainsburys tonight and it's been blocked at the till from being sold - anyone else found issues?  'Apparently all cooked chicken is blocked from sale including chicken sandwiches.' Another wrote: 'I saw two staff members removing loads of chicken products from the shelves this evening, they were being 'destroyed' - working from a big list.  'I managed to buy some but they checked the list first!'

"eae470f9ddc88a27b34ee958d06861fe3a106e453c44a7e2d1383c00": "Sadiq Khan's 'swanning around' the US is likely to cost British taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds as critics questioned whether the transatlantic trip is 'to promote London or to promote himself'. The Mayor of London is on a five day tour of America that has seen him schmoozing with James Corden and Hillary Clinton or taking the ceremonial first pitch at a Major League Baseball match. Critics have suggested that Mayor Khan is so keen for publicity on the trip he calls a PS10million trade mission that even a cup of coffee with former Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, was turned into a photo op. And after jetting across the country to the Silicon Valley in California, The Mayor of London grabbed more headlines after he said Donald Trump's term as US president led to a significant rise in racial abuse directed at him - and urged Elon Musk not to let the billionaire return to Twitter unless he was sure Trump had 'learned his lesson'. Amid suggestions commercial sponsorship and public cash may be funding the trip, London Assembly member for Croydon, Neil Garratt, who is Conservative spokesman for the economy and tourism in London, has written to the Mayor demanding to know the cost of the trip and who is paying.  Mr Garratt told MailOnline Mr Khan has been 'swanning around America promoting himself' while on a taxpayer-funded 'jolly overseas', hours after Home Secretary Priti Patel said his 'time would be better spent focusing on knife and drug crime in London' rather than being in America. 'The insider view at City Hall is he's leaving politics at the end of his second term, so this week looks more like a self-promoting 'gizza job' tour at taxpayers' expense', Mr Garratt said, adding: 'Is this a trip for the Mayor to promote London or to promote himself? The Mayor should do that on his own time, not at the cost of tens of thousands of pounds of public money'.  London Conservatives told MailOnline there are questions about 'probity and transparency' in the Mayor's office after their demand to know what the trip is costing Londoners, who have been handed a record 8.8 per cent council tax increase, was knocked back. Suspicions were raised after Mr Khan shared a tweet thanking United Airlines for 'getting me to NYC safely', prompting speculation the PS12bn airline may have provided free or discounted flights.   City Hall has said that the full costs of the visit will be calculated on the Mr Khan's return to London. But a week-long trip to China by Boris Johnson when he was mayor cost taxpayers PS65,000 due to flights, accommodation and expenses for him and his entourage.   Home Secretary Priti Patel has savaged Mayor of London Sadiq Khan's plans to legalise cannabis - telling him 'drugs ruin communities, tear apart families and destroy lives'. Mrs Patel hit out at Mr Khan after pictures emerged of him in the US - on what he called a trip to  'bang the drum' for London - visiting a legal drug farm and shop. Mr Khan was so impressed with the cannabis outlet and production line he announced the formation of a new group to look at decriminalising the drug in Britain. But the photoshot - which featured him looking serious surrounded by the plants - has prompted utter disbelief in some quarters. Mrs Patel, who has vowed to crackdown on middle-class drug users, was no plan of the Mayor's drive. She said: 'Sadiq Khan's time would be better spent focusing on knife and drug crime in London. 'The Mayor has no powers to legalise drugs. 'They ruin communities, tear apart families and destroy lives.'  Today Mr Khan claimed he was on a 'fact finding mission' to a California cannabis farm so he can explore the potential benefits of legalising the drug in the capital.  Hours earlier he was at a LA party with late-night TV host and former Londoner James Corden, who he embraced at a drinks reception also attended Love Actually director Richard Curtis. The former Labour MP, who previously admitted smoking cannabis on a friend's stag do in Amsterdam in his twenties, stared blankly at the plants as he wandered through them. Tory Leader at City Hall, Susan Hall, tweeted a picture of the visit and said: 'That's an interesting look on his face. Can you get high from just smelling the stuff??'  The visit to the drug farm sparked an angry rebuke from Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel, who reminded him he does not have the power to change the criminal law and his 'time would be better spent focusing on knife and drug crime in London'. Mr Khan continued his four-day tour of the US, which has included visits to New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, where he launched a PS10million campaign to bring more tourists to the British capital. The Mayor's spokesman said: 'The Mayor is in America this week to bang the drum for London. A big part of our continued recovery from the pandemic will be attracting international tourism, business and investment to our city once again. Tourism accounts for as many as one in five jobs in London and contributes almost 12 per cent of the city's Gross Domestic Product. 'The Mayor is committed to keeping the costs of the visit to a bare minimum and maximising value for money. Flight arrangements, including the Mayor's, are part of a broader agreement between the Greater London Authority and United Airlines.' On Monday Mr Khan attended the launch of an international tourism campaign - Let's Do London - in Times Square, after being photographed wandering around New York like a tourus Despite being in America to promote tourism Sadiq still found time to take centre stage at the San Francisco Giant's stadium to take the ceremonial first pitch. He had even found time to practice his throw while in Central Park, New York, the previous day. Mr Khan's visit to the States took him from meetings with Hilary Clinton and the Mayor of New York on the East Coast on Monday to the tech firms of Silicon Valley on Tuesday, where he met with Google and LinkedIn executives in San Francisco, While there, the mayor also waded into the debate over whether Donald Trump should be allowed back on Twitter after its new owner, Elon Musk, suggested he would reinstate his account. Mr Khan said the former president's period in office had led to a significant rise in racial abuse directed at him - and sharply dropped after he was banned. Mr Trump first criticised the London leader in 2016 for his response to the London Bridge terror attacks, then during a visit to the UK in 2019 called Mr Khan a 'stone cold loser' who had failed to manage crime rates in the capital. Mr Khan, who is also the first Muslim to be elected the mayor of a major Western city, said Mr Musk should 'wait and see' if Mr Trump had learnt his lesson. 'If it's the case that Donald Trump is going to use Twitter responsibly, I think that's all well and good. 'If he breaks the rules, there needs to be consequences and we can't afford a situation where people think social media is where people behave irresponsibly, where you see an increase in not just racism, sexism and misogyny but also division.' During the trip, City Hall announced this week US league baseball matches will again be played in London from next Summer. To celebrate, Mr Khan took centre stage at the Giants' stadium wearing an oversized jersey with his name emblazoned on it. Commentators said he received a 'modest reception' from the 21,000 fans when introduced during the interval. He later told ITV London: 'One of the things I have been making clear during this trip is my aspiration to have London as the sporting capital of the world - not just American football, baseball, boxing, tennis, cricket and so forth, but at some stage we would like the Olympics back as well..' And yesterday's cannabis farm visit in Los Angeles and new decriminalisation group puts him on a collision course with Labour leader Keir Starmer. A party spokesperson confirmed: 'Labour does not support changing the law on drugs. 'Drugs policy is not devolved to mayors and under Labour would continue to be set by national government.' The Mayor of London said former justice secretary Lord Charlie Falconer QC will be the chair of the first London Drugs Commission, which will assess the effectiveness of UK drug laws. Cannabis is currently classed as a class B drug, with a maximum sentence of five years in prison for possession. And while he can influence the debate, Mr Khan has no say in changing the law. Though advocates say smoking or eating the drug can make people feel happier, sceptics warn that regular cannabis use increases the risk of developing a psychotic illness. Results from European neighbours offer an insight into the potential pitfalls of the policy - with Portugal seeing a huge surge in cannabis-induced psychosis after it decriminalised the drug in 2001. Mr Khan later visited Gorrila RX Wellness shop in the Crenshaw area of the city, which stocks 1,900 brands of cannabis-related products including beverages, edibles and coffee beans. Kika Keith, owner of the shop, said the decriminalisation of cannabis in the UK would 'tremendously help' London's black community.", "67f94d15a2dbdb85cbfa29e46cc3d26ce038cfceb9f2d8e3346cf2d9": "Junior Downing Street staff being made to carry the can for Partygate are preparing to wreak a 'nightmarish' revenge on Boris Johnson, it was claimed today, as Scotland Yard revealed it has now dished out more than 100 fines. Ex-No10 aide Dominic Cummings said staff who were 'thrown under the bus' after being told boozy events were legal were threatening to reveal all to the Covid Inquiry next year.  The Prime Minister's former consigliere lashed out online as Mr Johnson and senior ministers endured a walk of shame on a Cabinet awayday. After the Metropolitan Police revealed the total number of Partygate fines had more than doubled, The Prime Minister and his Cabinet paraded in front of television cameras ahead of a meeting in Stoke-on-Trent. But they all refused to engage with questions about the latest tranche of fines, which raised the total from the 50 announced in April.   Many gave friendly greetings to the reporter asking questions but refused to say much else.  Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said she was 'too busy trying to make sure my heels don't fall through the cracks' of cobbles when asked about the latest batch of Covid fines. Writing on Twitter Mr Cummings said that junior staff had been told that Mr Johnson's team was working to 'ensure all No10 events are lawful' before they were fined by the Metropolitan Police.  'Also Tory MPs haven't twigged: PM throwing all these junior staff under bus to cops makes his life nightmarish in Covid inquiry,' he added. 'Am getting lots of texts today like ''I can't WAIT for the inquiry, I took lots of notes'.'  Labour MP Chris Bryant dubbed Downing Street 'the most lawbreaking workplace in Britain by a country mile' in light of the new fines.  The Prime Minister later ducked more questions in a television interview.  Asked if his previous statements about not knowing rules were broken in Downing Street could be true given the Metropolitan Police fines, he said: 'As soon as I have any more to say about that, you will be among the very first to know.' Asked if he thought Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had acted out of 'honour' by saying he would resign if issued with a fine over so-called 'beergate', Mr Johnson issued a similar response. He added: 'What we are doing here in Stoke is making sure that we focus on the thing that I think matters most to the people of this country right now, and that is getting us through the post-Covid aftershocks.' Mr Johnson went on to talk about the need to tackle the cost of living crisis, energy bills and supply chain issues. In the first update in a month, detectives working on the Operation Hillman probe into boozy gatherings in the corridors of power have doubled the number of fixed-penalty notices (FPNs) issued. The last update, which took place before the local election campaign period, said there had been 50 fines for officials and politicians.  Boris Johnson said thius afternoon that neither he nor wife Carrie had received a new fine. They previously paid a PS50 FPN each for attending his birthday party in June 2020 which indoor gatherings were against the law.  A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'As of Thursday 12 May, Operation Hillman, the investigation into breaches of COVID-19 regulations in Whitehall and Downing Street, has made more than 100 referrals for fixed penalty notices (FPNs) to the ACRO Criminal Records Office. 'These referrals have continued to be made throughout the period since our last update on Tuesday 12 April and the investigation remains live.' Some of the latest tranche of fines is reported to relate to  a Christmas Party in No10 in December 2020. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said Downing Street had 'racked up the dubious distinction of receiving more fines on the Prime Minister's watch than any other location'. Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey said: 'Boris Johnson stood up in Parliament and said Covid rules were followed in Number 10 at all times. 'Now 100 fines have been issued by the police over partygate. It shows the shocking scale of the law-breaking in Johnson's Downing Street and the extent of his lies.' Mr Johnson's official spokesman confirmed following the Met's update that neither the PM nor Cabinet Secretary Simon Case were among those fined in the latest tranche. 'With regards to the Cabinet Secretary and the Prime Minister, I don't have any update ... the position (is) we will update you if that were to change,' he said. Pressed on whether it was his understanding that the PM and Mr Case were not among those hit with the most recent set of penalties, the spokesman said: 'That's correct, yeah.' He added: 'You'll know that the Prime Minister has on a number of occasions apologised and made clear that there were things we simply did not get right, and that he is sorry for how this matter has been handled. 'Obviously that remains the case. And like I say, he will have more to say at the conclusion ... and when the Sue Gray report is published.' The Prime Minister said he was 'sure we'll have plenty to say about that when the thing's finished' when asked about the extent of law-breaking in Downing Street as he arrived for a Cabinet meeting in Staffordshire on Thursday. Ministers dodged questions on whether they still had faith in the PM when asked about the latest development at the same event. Home Secretary Priti Patel failed to say whether or not she still supported Mr Johnson, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid also chose not to answer when asked why the PM would not resign, despite Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's promise to do so if he is handed a fixed penalty notice. Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg made clear his continued backing of the Prime Minister, saying he 'deserves' his support. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi also said they still had faith in their leader when asked about the fines as they attended the Staffordshire meeting.", "1d5a835395345a238340118bd18f943e02156c2a9278d3fd95192269": "Rebekah Vardy asked the High Court 'who's Davy Jones?' following a nautical reference by Coleen Rooney's barrister as the PS3million Wagatha Christie libel trial continued for a third rollercoaster day.  The phrase Davy Jones' Locker has long been used to describe the dreadful resting place of sailors who have died at sea and are destined to remain forever at the bottom of the sea.  The earliest known reference of the negative connotation of Davy Jones occurs in the Four Years Voyages of Capt. George Roberts, by author Daniel Defoe, published in 1726 in London.  The idiom inspired a fictional character in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series who served as the tyrannical captain of ghost ship the Flying Dutchman.  The fictional Davy Jones should not be considered with Monkees singer David Thomas Jones, who also adopted the name.    The High Court burst into laughter after the exchange - which concerned the claim that Rebekah's agent, Caroline Watt, lost her phone containing WhatsApp messages when it fell off a boat into the North Sea.  Coleen's barrister, David Sherborne, has accused Rebekah of deleting key evidence that, it is said, would prove that Rebekah had been leaking stories to the media.  'We know that Ms Watt's phone is now in Davy Jones' Locker, don't we, Mrs Vardy?' Mr Sherborne said.  Rebekah then replied: 'I'm sorry, I don't know who Davy Jones is'.  The judge then had to describe the idiom, which refers to the legendary resting place of sailors who have drowned at sea.  The incident came 24 hours after Rebekah herself had to explain to Mr Sherborne a rude term that appeared in one of her texts.  Asked by the barrister what the abbreviation 'FFS' meant in one message Rebekah glanced nervously at the judge, who indicated it was all right to swear in court when the evidence demanded it.  'For F**** sake', Rebekah said.  The Wagatha Christie case centres around a 2019 social media post by Coleen, 36, in which she said she had planted fake stories on her private Instagram account and accused Rebekah of leaking them to The Sun. Rebekah, 40, denied the claim, and launched a libel case when Coleen refused to take down the post.     Today, the High Court heard how Rebekah received a text from her agent, Ms Watt, announcing 'it was me' after Coleen first publicly claimed that someone had been leaking stories from her private Instagram. Asked by Mr Sherborne why did not challenge her, Rebekah said it was because she had been 'watching Dancing on Ice' and was distracted by Gemma Collins's infamous 'face-plant'.     Coleen took furious notes throughout Rebekah's cross-examination, before pausing to smirk when Mr Sherborne accused her rival of lying.  She then turned back to her husband Wayne on her right and poked him in the arm with a pencil, before returning to her notepad.  Among the key developments on day three of the gripping case - As the toxic feud between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy spilled out in public for a third day, here is a summary of the evidence as it was heard in court: Rebekah Vardy was dramatically accused of lying today after she blamed heavy drinking for failing to remember the details of a 2018 World Cup paparazzi photo she allegedly helped to set up - as the Wagatha Christie libel trial entered its third day. She denied the allegation this morning. But when asked for details by barrister David Sherborne - acting for her rival Coleen Rooney - she said: 'If I'm completely honest I had been drinking quite a bit.' September 2017 to October 2019 - The Sun runs a number of articles about Coleen, including that she travelled to Mexico to look into baby 'gender selection' treatment, her plan to revive her TV career and the flooding of her basement. October 9, 2019 - Coleen uses social media to accuse Rebekah of selling stories from her private Instagram account to the tabloids. Coleen says she spent five months attempting to work out who was sharing information about her and her family based on posts she had made on her personal social media page. After sharing a series of 'false' stories and using a process of elimination, Coleen claims they were viewed by one Instagram account, belonging to Rebekah. Rebekah, then pregnant with her fifth child, denies the allegations and says various people had access to her Instagram over the years. She claims to be 'so upset' by Coleen's accusation, later adding: 'I thought she was my friend but she completely annihilated me.' The public dispute makes headlines around the world, with the hashtag #WagathaChristie trending. February 13, 2020 - In a tearful appearance on ITV's Loose Women, Rebekah says the stress of the dispute caused her to have severe anxiety attacks and she 'ended up in hospital three times'. Coleen says in a statement that she does not want to 'engage in further public debate'. June 23, 2020 - It emerges that Rebekah has launched libel proceedings against Coleen. Rebekah's lawyers allege she 'suffered extreme distress, hurt, anxiety and embarrassment as a result of the publication of the post and the events which followed'. November 19-20, 2020 - The libel battle has its first High Court hearing in London. A judge rules that Coleen's October 2019 post 'clearly identified' Rebekah as being 'guilty of the serious and consistent breach of trust'. Mr Justice Warby concludes that the 'natural and ordinary' meaning of the posts was that Rebekah had 'regularly and frequently abused her status as a trusted follower of Coleen's personal Instagram account by secretly informing The Sun of Coleen's private posts and stories'. February 8-9, 2022 - A series of explosive messages between Rebekah and her agent Caroline Watt - which Coleen's lawyers allege were about her - are revealed at a preliminary court hearing. The court is told Rebekah was not referring to Coleen when she called someone a 'nasty bitch' in one exchange with Ms Watt. Coleen's lawyers seek further information from the WhatsApp messages, but the court is told that Ms Watt's phone fell into the North Sea after a boat she was on hit a wave, before further information could be extracted from it. February 14 - Coleen is refused permission to bring a High Court claim against Ms Watt for misuse of private information to be heard alongside the libel battle. A High Court judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, says the bid was brought too late and previous opportunities to make the claim had not been taken. April 13 - Ms Watt is not fit to give oral evidence at the upcoming libel trial, the High Court is told as the case returns for another hearing. The agent revokes permission for her witness statement to be used, and withdraws her waiver which would have allowed Sun journalists to say whether she was a source of the allegedly leaked stories. April 29 - Rebekah 'appears to accept' that her agent was the source of allegedly leaked stories, Coleen's barrister David Sherborne tells the High Court. He argues that a new witness statement submitted by Rebekah suggests Ms Watt was the source but Rebekah claims she 'did not authorise or condone her'. Rebekah's lawyer Hugh Tomlinson says the statement did not contain 'any change whatever in the pleaded case', with her legal team having no communication with Ms Watt. May 10 onwards - The trial begins.   Mr Sherborne cuttingly replied: 'I would hope you're honest because you're sitting in a witness box.' He then added: 'Mrs Vardy, this is the first time that you have suggested that your recollection of events has been affected by drinking - that's a lie, isn't it?'    Today, the High Court heard how Rebekah received a text from her agent, Ms Watt, announcing 'it was me' after Coleen first publicly claimed that someone had been leaking stories from her private Instagram. Asked by Mr Sherborne why did not challenge her, Rebekah said it was because she had been 'watching Dancing on Ice' and was distracted by Gemma Collins's infamous 'face-plant'. In another bizarre exchange, the barrister referred to Ms Watt's claim that she had lost her phone after it had fallen off a boat into the North Sea. He said it was now 'lying at the bottom of sea in Davy Jones' locker',' only for Rebekah to ask the court: 'Who is Davy Jones?' Early in today's session, Mr Sherborne quizzed Rebekah about a series of messages she exchanged with her agent which allegedly show them working together to organise the 2018 World Cup paparazzi photo. The group of WAGs in the snap included Marcus Rashford's girlfriend Lucia Loi, Kyle Walker's partner Annie Kilner and Harry Maguire's fiancee Fern Hawkins - who was left 'upset and embarrassed' when it emerged in the media. Rebekah said Ms Watt had arranged for a photographer to take pictures of her as she left her hotel but denied giving the photographer the location of either the hotel or the restaurant where the WAGs were having dinner. The court heard Rebekah texted Ms Watt about travel arrangements from the hotel to the restaurant. There were exchanges about last minute changes in travel arrangements on the night. Mr Sherborne suggested that a message to Ms Watt which said, 'I have bought about 10 minutes' referred to the fact Rebekah was delaying some of the women from posting a group photograph on social media because a photographer hiding in the bushes by the hotel had taken a picture of them all and they 'didn't want to lose their exclusive'. In response, Rebekah said, 'Well, it reads like that' but said she 'couldn't recall' the details due to the amount of alcohol she had consumed. 'The plans changed,' she added. 'I recall it may have been raining. No one wants to walk when they're dressed up in the rain.' Mr Sherborne accused Rebekah of changing her story about what happened and reminded her that she had signed a statement of truth when she made legal declarations, risking a contempt of court action if she lied. 'You can't get your story straight,' he said to her, adding that this was 'because you're lying'. Mr Sherborne asked Rebekah why she was 'pulling a face' when he said he was going to refer to a witness statement made by the FA's family liaison officer, Harpreet Robertson. Rebekah - who has claimed the representative took an instant dislike to her - said: 'Because it was Ms Robertson again.' Quoting from the statement, Mr Sherborne Ms Robertson said other members of the group and a member of the England squad were upset that they had been 'set up' as they were not looking to court publicity. Rebekah replied: 'This is the first that I've heard of it.'   Mr Sherborne referred to a story in which Rebekah was alleged to have confirmed that there was no sex ban within the England squad during the 2018 World Cup. The article in The Sun had the headline: 'Becky Vardy reveals the secret to England's World Cup success is down to the lads getting to spend time with their WAGs. It said England's successful run in the tournament was down to Gareth Southgate 'giving the lads the freedom to score - with their wives and girlfriends.' Rebekah is said to have hinted that sex hadn't been explicitly forbidden as 'there is no proof it hinders performance' The article featured an apparently naked Rebekah draped inna flag of St George. The article described Rebekah as the 'unofficial leader of the WAGs. Asked if those were her words Rebekah denied the saying of the journalist who wrote the story: 'No it was his and it's quite an embarrassing statement.' During his cross-examination Mr Sherborne accused Rebekah of 'having selective amnesia'.  Rebekah has claimed that she and her fellow WAGs had to wash their own clothes in the sink at their hotel during the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The High Court heard that Rebekah gave an interview with The Sun during the football tournament as Coleen's lawyer accused her of trying to distance herself from the notion she had 'strong links' with journalists. Referring to this interview, Jamie Vardy's wife told the court: 'I was busy with the kids and under so much stress and we even had to wash our own clothes in the sink at the hotel.'  The High Court heard messages Ms Watt sent Rebekah as she was setting up the interview.   Ms Watt told her it was 'easy s**t' and that she should talk about how she is having a good time and 'backing the boys' but 'don't want any attention'. Rebekah allegedly 'used the anniversary of Coleen's sister's death as a peg to contact the WAG' after she unfollowed Jamie Vardy's wife on Instagram, the court heard. Coleen unfollowed Rebekah in January 2019 after the car crash story, suspecting she was the 'grass' who had leaked her information. In text messages between Rebekah and her agent Caroline Watt, Rebekah said she would like to contact Coleen and suggested 'saying something about' her sister Rosie, who died in 2013 aged 14. Mr Sherborne put it to Rebecca that she was going to 'use the anniversary' of Rooney's sister dying as 'the peg' to message her. Rebekah said: 'That's interpreted wrong'. In the event, Ms Watts suggested she use a different tack by saying she had recently been on Loose Women and the programme's booker asked if Coleen might want to appear on the show.  By Niomi Harris and Rebecca Davison for MailOnline He has managed to see the funny side after the size of his manhood was dragged into the Wagatha Christie court case after Rebekah Vardy compared it to a 'chipolata.' And on Thursday, Peter Andre, 49, took to Instagram to say that despite his positive stance, there would outrage if a man had made a similar slur about a woman's anatomy. He captioned a new video: 'Here I was this morning sat in my robe feeling like I had to say something. Feel free to come to your own conclusion. Just a couple of things first. Sorry to Emily and the children that have had to see and hear some not very nice things... You all know I like to take the p*** out of myself but maybe I felt a bit vulnerable this morning. Love from an Aussie Brit Greek.' In the video itself, he said: 'Hi everyone. Seeing as I haven't had much of a say in this, and just let everyone have a laugh and whatever, whatever, I'm just going to put it out.   Rebekah denied leaking information about Coleen's 2019 car crash in Washington DC to the media. Mr Sherborne quizzed Jamie Vardy's wife over an article in The Sun about how Coleen had narrowly escaped injury in a horror crash while husband Wayne was playing in the US. Coleen had posted a picture of her badly damaged Honda on her private Instagram account, the court heard. The story quoted a source who said: 'Coleen ended up having a bad smash when she was driving the family car. One side of the car was completely caved in. She couldn't drive it away and it looked like a total write off.' The day after the message was posted, Ms Watt sent a message to Rebekah saying: 'Am I imagining it or did you say yesterday that Coleen had crashed her Honda?' Rebekah replied: 'She defo has' - and instructed Ms Watt to go into Coleen's account. Ms Watt then sent another message saying: 'She must have taken whatever it is down as it's not there now.' Under cross-examination, Rebekah denied leaking the story.   An Instagram post from Coleen showed a photo of the damaged vehicle, which the court has been told about previously. 'RIP' and 'half a Honda', the post says. Mr Sherborne referred Rebekah to an article written in The Sun about the car crash. 'Coleen Rooney narrowly avoids injury in car crash and wrecks 4x4 just weeks after Wayne's arrest for 'public intoxication' in Washington,' the article, which was published on 25 January 2019, is headlined. DAY 1   ACCORDING TO TEAM VARDY  ACCORDING TO TEAM ROONEY  DAY 2  CLAIMS MADE DURING REBEKAH'S CROSS-EXAMINATION   Mr Sherborne brought up the text messages between Rebekah and Ms Watt about the crash, which took place on the 23 January. Ms Watt asked her about Coleen crashing the Honda and told her she could no longer see the Instagram post. 'I would have tried to have done a story on Coleen but the evidence has been deleted,' Ms Watt said in a message to Vardy, the court hears. The previous evening, Rebekah had been at the National Television Awards. She and Ms Watts were in a box hosted by The Sun, the court heard, and the journalist who wrote the car crash article a few days later, Andy Halls, was also there. Mr Sherborne accused Rebekah of changing her story on whether or not she knew Halls was there. In her witness statement submitted to the court, she said: 'Andy Halls may also have been there but I don't remember seeing him.' Referring to the texts between her and Ms Watts about the car crash, Rebekah said at one point: 'I wasn't paying that much attention, not at half past eight at night.' Mr Sherborne said: 'But you don't say to her it's half past eight and I want to watch my favourite show on TV, do you?' 'I don't really watch television,' said Rebekah.  Rebekah  agreed her agent 'appeared to be the source' of a news story on Coleen's 2019 car crash after the agent admitted 'it was me' in a text message. Rebekah was referring to the moment the celebrity tripped and fell face-first on the ice during one of the routines in the ITV show.  Coleen's lawyer David Sherborne read out two Instagram posts by his client in London's High Court about The Sun's article in the months before she embarked on her 'Wagatha Christie' investigation. In a public post, Coleen wrote: 'Someone on my private Instagram seen the picture and is telling or selling stories to a certain newspaper. It's happened several times now over the past couple of years. It's sad to think someone who I have accepted to follow me is betraying for either money or to keep a relationship with the press.' Mr Sherborne then took Rebekah to further texts sent between herself and her agent Ms Watt. 'Such a victim. Poor Coleen,' Ms Watt said to Rebekah at about 6.28pm on January 27, 2019. Just under 20 minutes later, she sent another message. 'And it wasn't someone she trusted. It was me'. Rebekah told the court: 'That seems to be what she's saying.' She said she didn't replying, adding 'at 6.35 I would have been bathing my children' at the time the message was sent. The court then heard that Rebekah allegedly tried to throw Coleen 'off the scent' with 'disingenuous messages' to her suggesting her account might have been hacked by journalists. Rebekah told Coleen in a private message: 'Oh my God. What the f*** is wrong with people. Why have they taken that one of you and the kids and not of Wayne in bed? That would have been an even better one in their eyes. D***heads. Hope you are OK.'  Mr Sherborne suggested Rebekah sent the message as she 'knew the finger of suspicion' was going to be pointed at her. Her message continued: 'That is so bad! And The Sun of all people as well! Have you been through all your followers? No one with any celeb mag links? What about being hacked? I would be chomping if that was me! Not on at all.' 'This was totally disingenuous, Mrs Vardy,' Mr Sherborne said. 'You knew perfectly well that you had been the source of this story through Caroline Watt but you presented yourself to her as someone who hates the Sun. You're trying to throw Mrs Rooney off the scent, aren't you?' 'I don't hate the Sun', Rebekah interjected. 'But you knew Mrs Rooney did,' Mr Sherborne said, and Rebekah agreed. The trial continues.    Rebekah allegedly tried to throw Coleen Rooney 'off the scent' with 'disingenuous messages' to her suggesting her account might have been hacked by journalists, the High Court heard. The WAG told Coleen in a private message: 'Oh my God. What the f*** is wrong with people. Why have they taken that one of you and the kids and not of Wayne in bed? That would have been an even better one in their eyes. D***heads. Hope you are OK.' Coleen's lawyer Mr Sherborne suggested Rebekah sent the message as she 'knew the finger of suspicion' was going to be pointed at her. Her message continued: 'That is so bad! And The Sun of all people as well! Have you been through all your followers? No one with any celeb mag links? What about being hacked? I would be chomping if that was me! Not on at all.' 'This was totally disingenuous, Mrs Vardy,' Mr Sherborne said. 'You knew perfectly well that you had been the source of this story through Caroline Watt but you presented yourself to her as someone who hates the Sun. You're trying to throw Mrs Rooney off the scent, aren't you?' 'I don't hate the Sun', Rebekah interjected. 'But you knew Mrs Rooney did,' Mr Sherborne said, and Rebekah agreed.  Team Rooney vs Team Vardy! Rebekah is supported by crisis manager who's an expert in online reputation and a VERY burly bodyguard in Jamie's absence - while Coleen has Hollywood's favourite barrister By Bridie Pearson-Jones for MailOnline  Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy have enlisted some of the country's finest media experts and legal minds as they go head to head in the celebrity trial of the decade. Yesterday was the second instalment of the PS3million 'Wagatha Christie' libel trial between the two footballer's wives which  featured a tearful appearance in the witness box, Whatsapp 'gossip' about a mystery celebrity affair and yet more foul-mouthed text messages - all brought to an end by a fittingly dramatic fire alarm. Coleen publicly 'outed' her fellow WAG when she accused her of sharing three fake stories she had posted on her personal Instagram with The Sun as part of what she described as a social media 'sting' operation. Rebekah vehemently denied the allegation - leading her to launch the pricey legal action which saw its second day on Wednesday. While Tuesday's hearing dredged up Peter Andre's alleged 'chipolata' manhood, yesterday focused on Rebekah's relationship with her agent Caroline Watt. In the Vardy corner is Hacked Off founder Hugh Tomlinson QC - as well as two glamorous members of the legal team, including one who was once named one of the 'sexiest lawyers' in the UK, and another who is a crisis manager who's experienced in online reputation. Vardy has also appeared alongside a security guard - whereas Coleen doesn't appear to have any bodyguard by her when entering court. Meanwhile, Coleen has been joined in court by her football superstar husband Wayne as well as Hollywood's favourite lawyer  David Sherborne and rising legal mind Ben Hamer. Here, FEMAIL reveals who's who at the trial that's kept the nation gripped...  TEAM VARDY Dr Rosa Malley In Rebekah's legal team is Dr Rosa Malley, 37,  an Associate in the Dispute Resolution team at top law firm Kingsley Napley. Rosa was a part of the Hacked Off campaign and specialises in reputation and media matters, according to her online bio. She previously worked as a paralegal at top city law firm Mishcon de Reya, who led the High Court bid to stop Boris Johnson triggering Brexit. One of their barristers, Anthony Julius, acted for Princess Diana in her divorce from Prince Charles. The firm also represented Heather Mills in her divorce case against Beatles star Paul McCartney, before separating 'amicably' from their client. The company also acted for former Liberal Democrat Cabinet minister Chris Huhne when he faced allegations of perverting the course of justice by 'swapping' speeding points with his wife. Mr Huhne was later sentenced to eight months in prison. Rosa got her PhD studying the Representation of Women in British Politics at University of Bristol in 2011. She works in pre and post-publication for broadcast media, and has also worked in crisis management with politicians, sportspeople, celebrities and high profile criminal defendants.  Before her legal career, Rosa worked in politics, as a researcher at the ThinkTank Institute for Government and as a Special Projects Manager for the Hacked Off campaign.  She also taught British Politics at Birkbeck, University of London. Fittingly for the case in question, Rosa has experience in online reputation and  abuse on social media. Charlotte Harris Like Rosa, Charlotte Harris, 44, worked at Hacked Off and for eminent law firm Mishcon de Reya. Described as 'one of the most sought out privacy lawyers in the land' she boasts a client base of 'MPs, celebrities, PR experts, sports agents, sports people'. In 2013, she married  investment banker James Burr, with a very star-studded guest list including Hugh Grant, MP Tom Watson, MP Chris Huhne, and Max Clifford. At the wedding millionaire former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne enjoyed his last night of liberty before he was sentenced the next day at Southwark crown court to eight months' imprisonment.  Writing in the Diary column for the New Stateman at the time, Mr Watson said he 'entertained' the gathering of celebrities, MPs, bankers and highly remunerated senior Mishcon staff with a karaoke rendition of the new wave anthem Teenage Kicks.   Clearly beauty and brains, she was named one of the country's sexiest lawyers in 2015 in a list put together by the website Legal Cheek. Charlotte has appeared before Parliamentary Select Committees throughout her career, including the Leveson Inquiry and was described as a 'force of nature and always ready for a fight' by Chambers and Partners High Net Worth Guide in 2020. Hugh Tomlinson QC  Hugh Tomlinson QC, who is representing Ms Vardy, is a top-flight privacy silk who has launched dozen of battles with the press in his four decade career. The Leeds-born, Oxford-educated lawyer last year advocated successfully in a claim against a journalist and author after she made false allegations that Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea FC on Vladimir Putin's orders. He was one of several lawyers representing Russian oligarchs whose ethics were questioned in parliament by the Conservative MP Bob Seely following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The lawyer was on the side of Jeremy Clarkson's ex-wife Alex Hall when he tried to - but dropped - efforts to stop her claiming they had an affair during his later marriage. He also successfully represented Prince Charles as the royal sought to stop the publishing of his Hong Kong travel diaries, saying public interest justifications were 'far-fetched'. And in an earlier case, he won substantial damages for Christopher Jefferies after press coverage incorrectly associated him with the murder of his tenant Joanna Yeates in 2010. A year later he co-founded Hacked Off, the group campaigning for tighter media regulation, which he now chairs, and which has backers such as Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan. Tomlinson was born in Woodhouse in Leeds where he went to Leeds Grammar School and then Balliol College, Oxford, leaving with the top first in PPE. He then took up philosophical studies at Sussex University before going to the University of Paris in 1977. In 2000 he was a founding member of Matrix Chambers in London.  Security   Rebekah  has also been seen going into court accompanied by a burly security guard - whereas Coleen doesn't appear to have any bodyguard alongside her. She's previously discussed how security is important to her and added that she's faced threats since her feud with Coleen went public.  She told OK! magazine ahead of the 2018 World Cup that she and her family were bringing their own security to the games. Nicola McLean  Fellow WAG Nicola McLean has seemingly thrown her support behind Mrs Vardy several times - once stating that Mrs Rooney is 'not as private' as she is considered while also insisting Mrs Vardy is not interested in the fame game. Nicola is married to Tom Williams, who now plays for Hashtag United of the Essex Senior League. Tom is a defender and midfielder and made nearly 300 appearances in the Football League playing for numerous clubs, including QPR and West Ham. The I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here star, who has been married to Tom since 2009, told Closer Magazine in 2020: 'I've had different experiences at different clubs but the WAG world can be a b****y mean girls like existence... 'There can be rivalry and unfriendliness with someone in the group and the top dog and there can be a lot of drama. It isn't just amazing holidays and designer clothes there can be a lot of behind-the-scenes politics between the girls.' On some of the most famous WAGS, she went on: 'A lot of women want to emulate Victoria Beckham, Alex Gerrard, Elen Rivas - they dine out on the fact they're a WAG and it can consume you.' Nicola then pointed out that it is not all it seems with Mrs Vardy and Mrs Rooney: 'I know some WAGs will only be interested in the hierarchy, fame and drama but I don't believe Rebekah is like that. She's not fussed about the press or limelight. 'Everyone thinks Coleen is really private - but remember she's done countless interviews, books and even her own TV show.' Caroline Watt  Mrs Vardy's friend and agent, Ms Watt has featured in some of the preliminary hearings, despite not being a party to the claim or giving evidence at the trial. She is a former Virgin Atlantic air hostess who has been Rebekah's agent for the past seven years, helping to build her profile in the national media. Reports that she no longer represents her following the current controversy engulfing the two have been dismissed as inaccurate with Ms Watt remaining close to Ms Vardy both professionally and personally. Ms Watt, 39, is married to former footballer Steve Watt, who played briefly for Chelsea, making one Premier League appearance for two minutes in 2005 and Swansea City. He is currently manager of Kent non-league side Hythe Town and they have two children. After leaving the airline industry, Ms Watt began working as an agent in the world of entertainment, quickly developing a reputation for her communication skills and ability to network. She was formerly employed by talent agency The Frontrow Partnership but left in 2019 to go it alone and took her main client and close friend, Ms Vardy with her. Ms Watt has been credited with building Ms Vardy's public profile by ensuring that she regularly featured in the national media and also brokered the deal for her to appear on the hit reality TV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2018. Ms Watt started representing the high-profile WAG in 2015, when her husband, Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy shot to fame. She is a regular visitor to the Vardy's Lincolnshire home and also socialises with Ms Vardy, attending glitzy parties and bars. Her other clients include the former Page 3 girl Nicola McLean but it is Ms Vardy that has been the biggest asset in her career as an agent. TEAM ROONEY  David Sherborne   Unlike Rebekah, Coleen arrived at court with just her husband and not an entourage of lawyers. However, her legal team is just as impressive and versed in the world of celebrity as her fellow WAG's. David Sherborne, 53, who has been dubbed one of Hollywood's favourite lawyers, is acting for Mrs Rooney. He was lead counsel for victims of press intrusion in the Leveson inquiry, and represented Johnny Depp in his libel suit against The Sun. In November 2020, the High Court ruled that Depp had lost his case. In September 2020, Sherborne was dropped from the Duchess of Sussex's legal team in her case against The Mail on Sunday following an early setback. Sherborne's previous clients also include Princess Diana, Melania Trump, Sir Paul McCartney, Sienna Miller, Kate Moss and Harry Styles. His father was a QC, but while he comes from a legal family, he is seen as a 'rebel' in many ways due to his apparent fondness for the limelight. A former colleague told The Times: 'He likes to present a fun, outgoing persona and is very limelight-seeking. All the other barristers in chambers were hyper-critical of him breaking the rules.' While he's known for rubbing shoulders with A-listers, Tattler and Evening Standard both commented he is 'so handsome'  he could be a celebrity himself. The twice-married barrister was revealed to be having an affair with a member of Lord Leveson's junior counsel, Carine Patry Hoskins in 2013-. Ms Hoskins, dubbed the 'thinking man's Pippa Middleton' -was Lord Leveson's number two, while Mr Sherborne was defending Hugh Grant and other hacking  victims. Ben Hamer There was a rare moment of light relief amidst the morning's fierce cross-examination when Mr Sherborne mentioned that his junior, Ben Hamer, 29,  was 'very adept at searching online through social media on his phone.' Rebekah shot back, without smiling: 'I know, Mr Hamer follows me on Twitter' to laughter in the court. But this isn't Ben's first celebrity case. He's previously  Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard  and acted for the claimant in Blackledge v Person(s) Unknown where libel and harassment damages of PS70,000 were awarded against the Defendant.  The Durham University graduate was first called to the Bar in 2017 at Lincoln's Inn, where he was a Lord Bowen and Lord Denning scholar. Very accomplished at a young age, he's previously was presented with the Benjamin Franklin House Literary Prize for his work on free speech and fake news.  He now provides pre-publication advice to various publications such as The Times and The Sunday Times as well as HarperCollins and Bloomsbury publishers. He is security cleared to SC level. Ben began as a tenant at 5RB after successful completion of pupillage at Chambers. His supervisors were Adam Wolanski QC, Jonathan Barnes QC, Richard Munden and Adam Speker QC. Ben was called to the Bar in 2017 at Lincoln's Inn, where he was a Lord Bowen and Lord Denning scholar. In 2017, Ben was presented with the Benjamin Franklin House Literary Prize, run in conjunction with the Daily Telegraph, for his writing on free speech, social media and 'fake news'. As an undergraduate, he edited Palatinate, where he won the Hunter Davies Prize for Student Journalism. Mrs Justice Steyn The High Court judge overseeing the case, Mrs Justice Steyn (pictured right) was appointed in 2019 and sits in the Queen's Bench Division - the part of the High Court which deals with defamation, personal injury and breach of contract claims. As well as overseeing the 'Wagatha Christie' claim, other prominent cases she has heard include Arron Banks' libel claim against journalist Carole Cadwalladr and the FDA union's unsuccessful legal challenge over Boris Johnson's decision to support Priti Patel following bullying accusations. The daughter of former Law Lord Lord Steyn, Mrs Justice Steyn covered a variety of cases as a barrister, including a case over the expansion of Heathrow airport.    WAYNE ROONEY Coleen has been joined in court by supportive husband Wayne, with whom she shares four children, while Jamie Vardy is yet to be pictured in court. Wayne, who has been with Coleen since the age of 16, last played with Jamie for England in 2016. Both husbands have kept mostly quiet on the clash, however Wayne did note in his Sunday Times column before last year's European championships that he would have drafted Jamie Vardy into the England team. He added: 'Some people may be surprised at this, especially with the legal case between my wife and Jamie's wife.' The former Premier League and England striker will take to the witness stand at London's High Court where he will be questioned under oath over how much he knew about his wife's 'Wagatha Christie' investigation. A source close to the case told MailOnline: 'Wayne is 100 per cent going into the witness box and this is just going to add to the drama of the whole occasion. Hugh Tomlinson is a very experienced barrister, and this could be one of the toughest opponents Wayne has ever faced. 'Rebekah's lawyers are adamant that he should be cross examined under oath about how much he knew about what Coleen was getting up to and that the truth will emerge.' Ms Rooney has always maintained that nobody was aware of her 'sting operation' when she decided to post a number of fake Instagram stories and eventually limit who could see them to just Ms Vardy. Three of these were later published in The Sun and are at the centre of the sensational libel battle. But Ms Vardy's lawyers insist that several people could have been the source of the leaks and that Ms Rooney told Wayne and others about what she was getting up to while also sharing details of the false posts with them. In addition to giving evidence, Wayne, the former Manchester United striker who is currently manager of Derby County, is also expected to accompany his wife when she attends the High Court for the trial, which is expected to last a week. Meanwhile, when Rebekah furiously denied the allegation in a lengthy Twitter statement, her husband showed his support by liking her post.  OTHER WAGS  Mrs Rooney thanked her fans and said there 'are a lot of really good people' in the world in an Instagram story in February 2022. And along with her devoted fans, the WAG has also been publicly supported by Danielle Lloyd, who came forth with similar claims about Mrs Vardy leading to a row between the duo on social media in 2019. Mrs Lloyd made a thinly-veiled dig at Mrs Vardy after weighing in on the Mrs Rooney row during an episode of This Morning. The TV personality detailed her 'similar run-ins' with the footballer's wife, before Mrs Vardy claimed Mrs Lloyd was only upset because she didn't 'recruit' one of Jamie's footballer pals for her after her divorce from Jamie O'Hara This came amid reports that many of the WAGs had distanced themselves from Mrs Vardy at the time and were busy 'scrutinising' past conversations with her, following the fallout from her feud with Mrs Rooney. Following Mrs Lloyd's appearance on This Morning, Mrs Vardy was quick to retaliate, as she took to Twitter to claim that the TV personality's admission was 'utter b******s' and their feud was sparked by her refusal to try and find Mrs Lloyd a man following her split from Jamie [O'Hara]. She wrote: 'Danielle Lloyd making false claims on @thismorning that we have had 'similar run-ins' is utter b****cks. She is just fuming that I 'didn't get Jamie recruiting' for her like she asked me to...'  ", "8c44c5b9c52d0961f2dff078afbc6712416182e3e6b24c0c693286da": "Thirteen more children in the UK have been struck down by a mystery hepatitis that has been spotted in more than 20 countries. There have now been 176 cases of the deadly liver disease among children under the age of 10 in Britain, with the majority (128) in England. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it was also probing a 'small number' of suspected cases in children over 10. It came as a child in Ireland has become the latest casualty of the outbreak, with a second child receiving a liver transplant. The latest death is thought to bring the global fatality toll to nine, with five reported in the US and three in Indonesia. There have been none in Britain so far. There have been around 350 cases of 'severe hepatitis of unknown origin' in children recorded in 21 countries since April. At least 26 youngsters have required liver transplants, according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) update last week. Experts have warned the current cases may be the tip of the iceberg due to poor surveillance in some countries. Scientists are puzzled as to what is causing the unusual illness, but the main theory is that it is triggered by a group of viruses that normally cause the common cold. Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE) did not disclose the age of the latest victim but said its cases have been among children under the age of 12. Since March, six children have been hospitalised with hepatitis in Ireland, which the HSE claimed 'is more than would usually be expected over this period of time'. The HSE said none of the cases in Ireland were linked and they were not linked to any of the patients in the UK. None had Covid, either. Ireland is working closely with the WHO and colleagues in the EU and Britain to identify the cause of the illnesses. Parents are advised to go to their GP if their child develops symptoms of hepatitis, which include pale, grey-coloured stools, very dark urine, or a yellowing of the eyes and skin.  The common viruses that cause hepatitis: hepatitis viruses A, B, C, and E; have not been detected in any of the cases reported worldwide. In its most recent update on May 9, the WHO said there had been 348 probable cases of hepatitis of unknown origin since the first was reported in Scotland in April. All of the cases are among children aged 11 months to five years and 'many' tested positive for adenovirus. The virus has not yet been identified in the liver tissue samples analysed 'and therefore, could be a coincidental rather than a causal factor', the WHO said. In new guidance this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US has told doctors treating children with hepatitis to take liver samples for analysis. Three quarters of the UK's hepatitis-stricken children have tested positive for adenoviruses, analysis suggests. Scientists are probing whether a mutated strain of adenovirus has evolved to become more severe, or if a lack of social mixing during the pandemic weakened children's immunity. They can't rule out an old Covid infection being involved.  In a bizarre twist last week, health chiefs in the UK are also investigating whether 'dog exposures' are to blame. The UKHSA said last week that a 'high' number of the British children with hepatitis were from families which own dogs. Officials did not explain how dogs could potentially be to blame, but they are known carriers of adenovirus strains. However, health officials have ruled out the Covid vaccine as a possible cause because the majority of the ill British children haven't been vaccinated due to their young age.  Hepatitis is usually rare in children, but experts have already spotted more cases in the UK since January than they would normally expect in a year.   What is hepatitis? Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver that is usually caused by a viral infection or liver damage from drinking alcohol.   Some cases resolve themselves, with no ongoing issues, but a fraction can be deadly, forcing patients to need liver transplants to survive. What are the symptoms? People who have hepatitis generally have fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, light-colored stools and joint pain. They may also suffer from jaundice -- when the skin and whites of the eyes turn yellow.  Why are experts concerned? Hepatitis is usually rare in children, but experts have already spotted more cases in the current outbreak than they would normally expect in a year. Cases are of an 'unknown origin' and are also severe, according to the World Health Organization. It has caused up to two deaths and 18 liver transplants.   What are the top theories?  Co-infection Experts say the cases may be linked to adenovirus, commonly associated with colds, but further research is ongoing. This, in combination with Covid infections, could be causing the spike in cases.  The WHO reported adenovirus has been detected in at least 74 of the cases. At least 20 of the children tested positive for the coronavirus. Weakened immunity British experts tasked with investigating the spate of illnesses believe the endless cycle of lockdowns may have played a contributing role. Restrictions may have weakened children's immunity because of reduced social mixing, leaving them at heightened risk of adenovirus.  This means even 'normal' adenovirus could be causing the severe outcomes, because children are not responding to it how they did in the past.  Adenovirus mutation Other scientists said it may have been the adenovirus that has acquired 'unusual mutations'. This would mean it could be more transmissible or better able to get around children's natural immunity.  New Covid variant UKHSA officials included 'a new variant of SARS-CoV-2' in their working hypotheses. Covid has caused liver inflammation in very rare cases during the pandemic, although these have been across all ages rather than isolated in children.  Environmental triggers   The CDC has noted environmental triggers are still being probed as possible causes of the illnesses.  These could include pollution or exposure to particular drugs or toxins.", "8933aef21cc30f1ce3b98b8b26adfa73dee840c4903a71cf87b60d96": "Former MP Natalie McGarry has been found guilty of embezzling almost PS25,000. McGarry, who represented Glasgow East between 2015 and 2017, was convicted of two charges of embezzlement - totalling PS24,635 - after a trial at Glasgow Sheriff Court. A jury found her guilty by majority of a charge of embezzling money while she was the treasurer of the Women for Independence campaign group between April 26 2013 and November 30 2015. She was also found guilty by majority of a second charge of taking money between April 9 2014 and August 10 2015 when she was treasurer, secretary and convener of the Glasgow Regional Association of the SNP. Addressing the 14 jurors, Sheriff Tom Hughes had told them: 'Remember that you have taken an oath or affirmation. This requires you to base any verdict only on evidence that you have heard in this court. 'You promised to return a true verdict in accordance with the evidence. 'You must put out of your mind anything you heard on TV, radio or read in a newspaper, anything you have read about the accused. 'You, ladies and gentlemen, are in a privileged position. You have been able to sit and listen to all of the evidence. It is now for you to consider.' Jurors were told that in order to convict McGarry, they would have to be confident beyond reasonable doubt that the funds were misappropriated and used dishonestly. McGarry, of Clarkston, East Renfrewshire, had denied both charges against her. The six-week trial has heard evidence from several witnesses, including current and former Scottish health secretaries Humza Yousaf and Jeane Freeman.", "80ac790fd0493cffbcfa6458cd463f48f0f69ef5acbe4aad9db4f8c7": "In an historic first, astronomers have captured a remarkable image of a supermassive black hole at the heart of our Milky Way galaxy. The eagerly-anticipated picture, revealed to the world today, shows Sagittarius A* -- which is roughly 4.3 million times the mass of our sun and is located about 27,000 light-years away from the Earth.  Because of its distance from us, experts said it appears the same size in the sky as a donut on the moon.  It comes just over three years after the same astronomers revealed the first ever photograph of a black hole.  The two black holes bear striking similarities, despite the fact that Sagittarius A* is 2,000 times smaller than Messier 87, which is located in a distant galaxy 55 million light-years away. In a highly-anticipated string of press conferences held simultaneously around the world, the team behind the Event Horizon Telescope shared their findings after teasing a 'groundbreaking Milky Way galaxy discovery'. While announcing the new image, the University of Arizona's Feryal Ozel called the black hole 'the gentle giant in the centre of our galaxy'. It was also described as 'the glue that holds the galaxy together'. Black holes are regions of space where the pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape, including light.  Therefore the image released depicts not the black hole itself, because it is completely dark, but the glowing gas that encircles the phenomenon in a bright ring of bending light, known as the accretion disc. The ring is roughly the size of Mercury's orbit around the sun, which is about 40 million miles (60 million km) across.  Sagittarius A* - abbreviated to Sgr A*, which is pronounced 'sadge-ay-star' - owes its name to its detection in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. Its existence has been assumed since 1974, with the detection of an unusual radio source at the centre of the galaxy. In the 1990s, astronomers mapped the orbits of the brightest stars near the centre of the Milky Way, confirming the presence of a supermassive compact object there - work that led to the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics. Though the presence of a black hole was thought to be the only plausible explanation, the new image provides the first direct visual proof. Because it is 27,000 light years from Earth, it appears the same size in the sky as a donut on the moon. Capturing images of such a faraway object required linking eight giant radio observatories across the planet to form a single 'Earth-sized' virtual telescope called the EHT. These included the Institute for Millimeter Radio Astronomy (IRAM) 30-meter telescope in Spain, the most sensitive single antenna in the EHT network. The EHT gazed at Sgr A* across multiple nights for many hours in a row - a similar idea to long-exposure photography and the same process used to produce the first image of a black hole, released in 2019. That black hole is called M87* because it is in the Messier 87 galaxy. Astronomers said the discovery provides overwhelming evidence that the object is indeed a black hole, and yields valuable clues about the workings of such giants, which are thought to reside at the centre of most galaxies.  Scientists had previously seen stars orbiting around something invisible, compact, and very massive at the centre of the Milky Way.  This strongly suggested that the object was a black hole, and today's image provides the first direct visual evidence of it.  Although it is not possible to see the black hole itself, because it is completely dark, glowing gas around it reveals a telltale signature: a dark central region (called a shadow) surrounded by a bright ring-like structure.  The new view captures light bent by the powerful gravity of the black hole. 'We were stunned by how well the size of the ring agreed with predictions from Einstein's Theory of General Relativity,' said EHT Project Scientist Geoffrey Bower from the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taipei.  'These unprecedented observations have greatly improved our understanding of what happens at the very centre of our galaxy, and offer new insights on how these giant black holes interact with their surroundings.' The EHT team's results are being published today in a special issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.  Dr Younsi, a UKRI Stephen Hawking Fellow at the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: 'Our results are the strongest evidence to date that a black hole resides at the centre of our galaxy.  'This black hole is the glue that holds the galaxy together. It is key to our understanding of how the Milky Way formed and will evolve in the future. 'Producing this image is the result of a monumental effort by hundreds of scientists over five years.  'It was especially challenging because of the haze of stars, dust, and gas in between Earth and the galactic centre, as well as the fact that the pattern of light from Sgr A* changes quickly, over the course of minutes. 'But now we have comprehensive findings, and this work opens a new chapter in our understanding of black holes.' In April 2019, astronomers revealed they had captured an image of a black hole 310 million trillion miles (500 million trillion km) away in a galaxy called M87. Messier 87 was described by scientists at the time as 'a monster', measuring some 24 billion miles (40 billion km) across -- three million times the size of the Earth. That was also imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope, a network of eight linked telescopes, showing a glowing ring of red, yellow and white surrounding a dark centre. The eight telescopes collected 5 petabytes of data -- or the 'equivalent of 5,000 years of mp3s,' or 'a lifetime of selfies for 40,000 people.' The event horizon is theoretical boundary around a black hole where not light or other radiation can escape. When any of that material gets too close to the edge of the hole, known as the event horizon, its atoms are ripped apart. The nuclei disappear below the horizon, the much lighter electrons get caught up in the black hole's intense magnetic field and tosses them around at high speed. This twisting motion causes them to release photons, which is the main source of emission from matter close to the black hole. The observations from the Event Horizon Telescope can now be counted among of the most significant scientific breakthroughs of the century. As well as looking alike, both Sgr A* and M87 behaved as predicted by Einstein's 1915 theory of General Relativity, which holds that the force of gravity results from the curvature of space and time, and cosmic objects change this geometry. Despite the fact Sgr A* is much closer to us, astronomers said imaging it presented unique challenges. Gas in the vicinity of both black holes moves at the same speed, close to the speed of light. But while it took days and weeks to orbit the larger M87*, it completed rounds of Sgr A* in just minutes. The brightness and pattern of the gas around Sgr A* changed rapidly as the team observed it, 'a bit like trying to take a clear picture of a puppy quickly chasing its tail,' said EHT scientist Chi-kwan Chan of the University of Arizona. The researchers had to develop complex new tools to account for the moving targets. The resulting image - the work of more than 300 researchers across 80 countries over a period of five years - is an average of multiple images that revealed the invisible monster lurking at the centre of the galaxy. Scientists are now eager to compare the two black holes to test theories about how gasses behave around them -- a poorly understood phenomenon thought to play a role in the formation of new stars and galaxies. Probing black holes - in particular their infinitely small and dense centres known as singularities, where Einstein's equations break down - could help physicists deepen their understanding of gravity and develop a more advanced theory. Black holes are extraordinarily dense objects with gravity so strong that not even light can escape, making viewing them quite challenging.  A black hole's event horizon is the point of no return beyond which anything - stars, planets, gas, dust and all forms of electromagnetic radiation - gets dragged into oblivion. The international collaboration that makes up the Event Horizon Telescope effort includes observatories in the South Pole, Europe, South America, Africa, North America, and Australia -- all of which must be pointed directly at the object to measure the surrounding activity. The project began in 2012 to try to directly observe the immediate environment of a black hole.  Thursday's announcement was made in simultaneous news conferences in the US, Germany, China, Mexico, Chile, Japan and Taiwan. There are different categories of black holes.  The smallest are so-called stellar-mass black holes formed by the collapse of massive individual stars at the ends of their life cycles, while there are also intermediate-mass black holes. Finally there are the supermassive black holes that inhabit the centre of most galaxies. These are thought to arise relatively soon after their galaxies are formed, devouring enormous amounts of material to achieve colossal size. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy that contains at least 100 billion stars. Viewed from above or below it resembles a spinning pinwheel, with our sun situated on one of the spiral arms and Sagittarius A* located at the centre. The M87 black hole is far more distant and massive than Sagittarius A*, situated about 54 million light-years from Earth with a mass 6.5 billion times that of our sun.  Using a 'virtual telescope' built eight radio observatories positioned at different points on the globe, the team behind the Event Horizon Telescope has spent the last few years probing Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way, and another target in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. The observations relies on a network of widely spaced radio antennas.  These are all over the world -- in the South Pole, Hawaii, Europe and America. These radios mimics the aperture of a telescope that can produce the resolution needed to capture Sagittarius A.  At each of the radio stations there are large hard drives which will store the data. These hard drives are then processed at the MIT Haystack Observatory just outside Boston, Massachusetts. The effort is essentially working to capture a silhouette of a black hole, also commonly referred to as the black hole's shadow. This would be 'its dark shape on a bright background of light coming from the surrounding matter, deformed by a strong spacetime curvature,' the ETH team explains.

Gruesome footage shows the horror fight between wrestlers Ronnie Thatcher and Blizzard that took place on April 29 at Seaham Conservative Club in County Durham. Children can be seen staring in shock as blood trickles down the wrestlers while they beat each other with glass lighting tubes and wooden sticks. The Colliery Championship Wrestling event was billed as a 'Pits of Punishment' fight and offered a family discount for parents wanting to bring their children.  But members of the audience were left open-mouthed and gasping, with some even moving away from the violence and try to get to the back of the room.  One of the wrestlers has since admitted they 'went overboard' - but is f****** sick of apologising'. While the event organisers have confirmed 'there will not be a repeat' of what unfolded. The promoter James Barrass claimed the wrestlers only suffered from a 'couple of scratches here and there'.   Today, a Durham Constabulary spokesman said: 'We are working with Durham County Council's licensing team after a number of complaints were received by the local authority in relation to an event at Seaham Conservative Club on April 29. Enquiries are ongoing.'  It comes as Teesside-based wrestler Benji condemned the violence that took place in front of children as he shared some of the footage online. He said: 'Please don't do death matches on a family friendly show. There's a time and place and this is definitely not it.  'Families and venues don't see company names they just see ''The Wrestling'' this isn't what we need.' He continued: 'The videos I've seen there was a mother shielding their child's face as glass and blood went everywhere.  'They got lucky this time and the wrestlers only got cuts and bruises but what if the untrained cowboys lost an eye or worse. 'CCW didn't hold their hands up they said the fans like it, the venue didn't mind and the wrestlers went into business for themselves and it got out of hand... Yet they want to run 18+ death matches.' However, one of the wrestlers, Ronnie Thatcher, has since posted a video to Facebook in which he said he is 'f****** sick of apologising' about the event.  He said: 'I have apologised and apologised, numerous f****** times right. How many more times do I need to apologise? 'CCW has promised this will never happen again. Me and Blizzard went overboard, we understand that, we've apologised.  'We can apologise until we're blue in the face, is it going to change everybody's minds? No. Why? Because some people think that they're perfect, that they haven't done nothing wrong in their lives.  'No one in their life has been perfect. We make mistakes in our lives, some more than others... but we learn... 'I am f****** sick of apologising, I am f****** sick of people making us out to be bad guys all the f****** time.' And the event's promoter, James Barrass, posted a video online with Ronnie Thatcher saying it was 'on famillies' to leave.  He said: 'We are a family show don't get me wrong. That was on families. We put a full show on... 'This was kind of a dark match, kind of unsanctioned, kind of out of my hands, I wanted you to fight, we knew what it was. 'What I have said is in life we live we learn and we move on. We don't always get it right, and if we do how will we ever learn? 'I don't wanna associate with them kind of people, I want to associate with people who put their hands up and say they have made a mistake. I don't want goody two shoes hanging around me.' He told the BBC: 'The [wrestlers] got looked after behind the scenes. A couple of scratches here and there,' he said. 'Blizzard was out having breakfast with his girlfriend the very next day. He said getting a new tattoo hurt him more.' The wrestling group has now posted to Facebook to confirm that no similar events will be hosted again.  The post reads: 'There will be no repeat of went down at PITS OF PUNISHMENT like what we saw between Ronnie and Blizzard again. It will only take place in over 18 shows (yes you can screenshot this for twitter). 'The match was only supposed to be a doors match, where both men took it upon themselves to take things to another level. We apologise to everyone this may have upset and we will make sure this will never happen again. 'We are very sorry, and all we can do is make things right.'

But cryptocurrencies have taken a hammering in recent days as fears for the stability of the global economy spread and panicky investors sell of assets deemed to be risky. Bitcoin - the most well-known cryptocurrency - has lost more than 50 per cent of its value since it reached a peak of nearly PS50,000 per coin in November last year.  Its main rival, Ethereum, is now worth less than half of what it was at the start of this year, while another crypto - Luna - saw 98 per cent of its value wiped out overnight.  Amid their instability, many ordinary people continue to be confused about what cryptocurrencies are and how they work.  Whilst Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most popular version, there are more than 5,000 different cryptocurrencies in circulation.   Below, MailOnline answers key questions about cryptos.  What is cryptocurrency? A cryptocurrency is a decentralised digital currency that can be used for transactions online. It is the internet's version of money - unique pieces of digital code that can be transferred from one person to another. Unlike centralised currencies such as the Pound Sterling or the U.S. dollar, there is no governmental authority that manages cryptocurrencies or how much they are worth.   All crytocurrencies use what is known as blockchain technology - an open ledger that records transactions in code.  Explaining the blockchain, crypto expert Buchi Okoro told Forbes: 'Imagine a book where you write down everything you spend money on each day. 'Each page is similar to a block, and the entire book, a group of pages, is a blockchain.'  The blockchain allows all records of transactions to be recorded and checked to prevent fraud.  Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency. It was created in 2009 by a person or group of people going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto.  Nakamoto has never been identified, although Australian businessman Craig White claims to be the man behind the pseudonym.  The supply of bitcoins is carefully controlled - no one will ever be able to create or issue new coins at will.  There will also never be more than 21million bitcoins, whilst each coin is itself divisible into 100million units that known as Satoshis .  This stops the erosion of value - inflation - that plagues national currencies.   How do you buy them? Cryptocurrencies can be bought on what are known as exchanges, with Coinbase and Bitfinex being among the most popular.  Exchanges allow ordinary people with little knowledge of the technical aspects of cryptos to buy them simply.  The exchanges allow traders to buy fractions of coins rather than whole ones. It means they can spend as little as much as they like - rather than forking out what could be tens of thousands of pounds if they were to buy a whole coin.  However, most exchanges charge a fee to invest.  Generally, this is a small percentage of the amount of crypto purchased, along with a flat fee depending on the size of the transaction.   In the UK, Coinbase charges a 3.9 per cent fee for orders over PS200 that are bought using a debit card. Purchases through a UK bank transfer incur a smaller 1.4 per cent commission. What can you use cryptocurrencies for?  Cryptocurrencies can be used to make purchases and to send money abroad easily.  However, at present, most retailers do not accept the likes of bitcoin as a form of currency.  One way to get around this is to exchanging cryptocurrencies for gift cards that can then be used at ordinary retailers. Crypto debit cards can also be used to make purchases. The cards are preloaded with a cryptocurrency of your choice. Whilst the user spends their cryptocurrency, the retailer will receive ordinary money as payment.  Cryptocurrencies are also increasingly regarded as a form of investment, although experts caution about their volatility.  Bitcoin has long been referred to as 'digital gold' because of the fact that, like the precious metal, it is regarded by some as a good store of value.  Why are cryptocurrencies popular?  Cryptocurrencies are popular in part because they remove the role of central banks and governments from the supply of money.  With cryptos such as bitcoin, there is a fixed number of coins that ever be produced, which supporters claim makes them invulnerable to inflation.  There is no central authority that suddenly devalue the currency by producing many more coins.   Another reason for their popularity is the fact that whilst governments can freeze bank accounts or even confiscate money from individuals, cryptocurrencies generally remain out of their reach.  This has however made cryptos such as bitcoin also popular with criminals wishing to hide assets from authorities.  Cryptocurrencies are also popular because there is no need to open a bank account to start trading them. A final aspect contributing to their popularity is of course the ability to make large amounts of money investing in cryptocurrencies.  As an example, despite its recent plummet, bitcoin has still risen in value by nearly 11,000 per cent since its 2009 creation.  Can you make money from cryptocurrencies?  In short, the answer is yes. But the same is also true in the reverse.  As has been proven by their recent plummets in value, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum are very volatile.  As an example, whilst bitcoin was trading at around $1 per coin in its very early days, it went on to peak at more than $60,000 in November last year. Over the course of 2020, bitcoin nearly quadrupled in value. It then plummeted in the summer of 2021 before reaching its peak. But since the turn of the year, it has lost more than half of its value once again.  As a result, many experts advise ordinary investors to stay away from cryptos in favour of more stable investments.  Are there any crypto billionaires? According to Forbes, there are 19 individuals in the world who have become billionaires through cryptocurrencies.  The richest is Canadian citizen Changpeng Zhao, is said to be worth $65billion.  He is the founder of Binance, which is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world when measured by daily trading volume.  Zaho also owns a relatively small amount of bitcoin himself.  Other crypto billionaires include Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, which is another cryptocurrency exchange.  He is believed to be worth an estimated $24billion. As well as owning half of FTX, he also owns $7billion of FTT, FTX's native cryptocurrency.  Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong has also become a billionaire, with a net worth of $6.6billion. A third individual to have made money from the world of crypto is Gary Wang, who is the co-founder of FTX.  Before his foray into cryptocurrencies, Wang was an engineer at Google. He is worth around $5.9billion.  What is Bitcoin mining? People create bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies through what is known as mining. Mining is the process of solving complex math problems using computers running bitcoin software. These mining puzzles get increasingly harder as more bitcoins enter circulation. Each time a puzzle is solved, a new groups of transactions - known as blocks - are added to the blockchain (the shared transaction record). Miners are rewarded by being issued with bitcoin.  However, mining is now out of reach of most ordinary people because of the immense cost involved.   Spencer Montgomery, founder of Uinta Crypto Consulting, told Forbes: 'As the Bitcoin network grows, it gets more complicated, and more processing power is required. 'The average consumer used to be able to do this, but now it's just too expensive.' Bitcoin mining also uses an enormous amount of energy, estimated to be around 0.21 per cent of all the world's electricity.  This is similar to the amount of energy used by Switzerland each year.   Why are cryptocurrencies crashing, and is this linked to the wider economy?  Many fans of bitcoin had argued that because it has no central authority and is not controlled by central banks, it would hold its value through economic dips, global conflicts or policy changes.  However, this has proven not to be the case. In recent years, bitcoin's volatility has followed similar rises and falls in stock markets. As an example, when the coronavirus pandemic struck in March 2020 and global markets plummeted, so too did bitcoin.  But both stock markets and cryptocurrencies then recovered more or less in parallel. Bitcoin's fall in recent weeks has again mirrored declines in the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500. Part of the volatility is being caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the effect this has had on supply chains and oil prices.  Whilst some crypto fans hope that bitcoin's price will at some point decouple from the stock market as it previously had been, this has so far not been the case.  Bitcoin's value also fell when China cracked down on bitcoin mining in mid-2021 and plummeted again when Tesla founder Elon Musk said last year that his firm would no longer accept bitcoin for payments due to environmental concerns.

But the WAG has told the PS3million Wagatha Christie libel trial that she did not reply to Ms Watt's message because she was distracted by Gemma Collins' 'faceplant' on Dancing on Ice. Rebekah was referring to the moment the celebrity tripped and fell face-first on the ice during one of the routines in the ITV show.  Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy's wife today entered the witness box for the third time on what is expected to be the final day of her evidence in what has been dubbed the 'Wagatha Christie' case. In a viral social media post in October 2019, Coleen, 36, said she had carried out a 'sting operation' and accused Rebekah, 40, of leaking 'false stories' about her private life to the press. Rebekah denies leaking stories to the media and is suing her fellow footballer's wife for libel, while Coleen is defending the claim on the basis her post was 'substantially true'. Coleen's lawyer David Sherborne read out two Instagram posts by his client in London's High Court about The Sun's article in the months before she embarked on her 'Wagatha Christie' investigation. In a public post, Coleen wrote: 'Someone on my private Instagram seen the picture and is telling or selling stories to a certain newspaper. It's happened several times now over the past couple of years. It's sad to think someone who I have accepted to follow me is betraying for either money or to keep a relationship with the press.' Mr Sherborne then took Rebekah to further texts sent between herself and her agent Ms Watt. 'Such a victim. Poor Coleen,' Ms Watt said to Rebekah at about 6.28pm on January 27, 2019. Just under 20 minutes later, she sent another message. 'And it wasn't someone she trusted. It was me'. Rebekah told the court: 'That seems to be what she's saying.' She said she didn't replying, adding 'at 6.35 I would have been bathing my children' at the time the message was sent. The court then heard that Rebekah allegedly tried to throw Coleen 'off the scent' with 'disingenuous messages' to her suggesting her account might have been hacked by journalists. Rebekah told Coleen in a private message: 'Oh my God. What the f*** is wrong with people. Why have they taken that one of you and the kids and not of Wayne in bed? That would have been an even better one in their eyes. D***heads. Hope you are OK.'  Mr Sherborne suggested Rebekah sent the message as she 'knew the finger of suspicion' was going to be pointed at her. Her message continued: 'That is so bad! And The Sun of all people as well! Have you been through all your followers? No one with any celeb mag links? What about being hacked? I would be chomping if that was me! Not on at all.' 'This was totally disingenuous, Mrs Vardy,' Mr Sherborne said. 'You knew perfectly well that you had been the source of this story through Caroline Watt but you presented yourself to her as someone who hates the Sun. You're trying to throw Mrs Rooney off the scent, aren't you?' 'I don't hate the Sun', Rebekah interjected. 'But you knew Mrs Rooney did,' Mr Sherborne said, and Rebekah agreed. The trial continues.", "5fee3a18880f15bc45409dd2db974b5f77952f6330e6b694e873a4c9": "Furious Twitter users have been left mocking a Tory MP who sparked fury after saying Britons should 'be able to feed themselves on 30p' a day. Ashfield MP Lee Anderson Anderson, who earns PS84,144 a year as an MP, caused uproar after he claimed that Brits 'can't budget' and there was 'not this massive use for food banks' in Britain.  He also offered an invitation for Opposition MPs to visit a scheme in his own constituency that represented 'a real food bank' and allowed people to 'make a meal for about 30p a day'. Mr Anderson, a former Labour councillor who defected to the Conservatives prior to his election to Parliament in 2019, faced immediate anger in the House of Commons. He was berated for his 'crass and cruel' comments as Britons up and down the country face a cost-of-living crisis due to soaring prices, and provoked the row as he spoke in a Commons debate on the Queen's Speech. Many Brits took to social media to slam his comments, and mockingly suggest the different 'meals' they could afford for 30p from their local supermarket. One shared a photo of a single Shreddie in an empty bowl, writing: 'I took up the challenge to make a meal for around 30p per day set by Lee Anderson. 'It's wholesome, with protein and fibre. I'm sure I won't be hungry today...tomorrow I will have the milk.'  Meanwhile another posted a photograph of a single cracker with shredded cheese on top, writing: 'He has a point Alan, I made this meal for under 30p. 'However I despair at our current government, they couldn't care less about the public.'  A third shared a photograph of a tiny meal moulded out of clay, jokingly writing: 'Dunno why people are disagreeing with his comment, I made this steak meal for 30p.' A fourth penned: ''Decided to go to the shop to see what I could get for 30p. I got a singular onion.  'Now Lee Anderson, how do I turn this into a nutritional meal.' Posting a photograph of a 30p bag of carrots from Sainsburys, another person wrote: 'I'm taking Lee Anderson 30p challenge. 'Tonight: A bag of carrots. Tomorrow: One single lemon.'  Another person posted a photograph of half-a-tin of dog food as well as a single carrot and potato, saying: 'There you go Lee Anderson...30p.  'Only problem, if I cook it properly, as you suggest is my problem, by the time I've taken into account my energy costs, it becomes a PS3.40 meal.' Addressing MPs on the Opposition benches, he urged them to 'come to Ashfield and work with me for a day in my food bank and see the brilliant scheme we have got in place where when people come now for a food parcel, they have to register for a budgeting course and a cooking course'. Lee Anderson is a former coal miner, ex-Labour councillor and a committed Brexiteer. The 55-year-old describes himself as 'born and bred' in Ashfield, the Nottinghamshire constituency he now represents in the House of Commons. After leaving school, he followed his coalmining father into the pits, where he worked for 10 years. According to a biography on his website, Mr Anderson then volunteered at a local Citizens Advice bureau, worked in hostels for homeless care leavers, and took a job in a local MP's office. He also became a local Labour councillor after being a lifetime party member. A 2018 local newspaper report detailed how Mr Anderson was subject to an investigation by his fellow Labour councillors. It came after he was issued with a community protection warning after placing boulders to deter travellers from setting up camp at a local site. Mr Anderson soon defected to the Tories and was later elected a Conservative councillor. Not long after, he was elected to Parliament as MP for Ashfield in 2019 as part of Boris Johnson's 80-seat Tory majority. His Westminster election campaign provoked a row after he claimed 'nuisance' council tenants should be forced to live in tents and pick vegetables. It led to accusations he was promoting 'forced labour camps'. Mr Anderson was also criticised after being caught out setting up a door knock while canvassing. He was revealed to have told a householder ahead of his visit: 'Make out you know who I am, that you know I'm the candidate but not that you are a friend.' After joining the Commons, Mr Anderson made headlines again when he announced he would not watch England matches during the Euro 2020 football tournament. He explained this was due to players taking the knee before matches in an anti-racism gesture. The MP voiced his opposition due to the association of the gesture with the Black Lives Matter movement. Last December, Mr Anderson was among Tory rebels to vote against 'Plan B' Covid restrictions. 'What we do in the food bank, we show them how to cook cheap and nutritious meals on a budget,' he added. 'We can make a meal for about 30 pence a day. And this is cooking from scratch.' Labour MP Alex Cunningham intervened to ask Mr Anderson whether he thought it 'necessary to have food banks in 21st century Britain'. Mr Anderson replied: 'He makes a great point and this is exactly my point. 'So, I invite you personally to come to Ashfield, look at our food bank, how it works and I think you will see first hand that there's not this massive use for food banks in this country. 'But generation after generation who cannot cook properly, they can't cook a meal from scratch. They cannot budget. The challenge is there. 'Come, come. I'll offer anybody.' Noting the reaction of other MPs to his remarks, Mr Anderson added: 'You're sat there with glazed expressions on your faces looking like I've landed from a different planet. 'Come, come to Ashfield, come next week, come the week after, come to a real food bank that's making a real difference to people's lives.' The Trussell Trust charity runs more than 1,400 food bank centres across the UK. There are also estimated to be 1,200 independent food banks in addition to those run by the Trussell Trust, Salvation Army and those based in schools. Responding directly to Mr Anderson's comments in the Commons, the SNP's Joanna Cherry said: 'All of us have food banks in our constituency. 'We don't really need to visit his because we're perfectly well aware of the requirement for them. 'But the requirement for them is not because people don't know how to cook, it's because we have poverty in this country at a scale that should shame his Government.' Karen Buck, Labour's shadow work and pensions minister, said: 'In the world where people actually live we now hear daily stories of families going without food and others unable to turn their ovens on in fear of rising energy bills. 'The idea that the problem is cooking skills and not 12 years of government decisions that are pushing people into extreme poverty is beyond belief. 'Out of touch doesn't even cover it.' Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi also attacked Mr Anderson's 'astonishing' remarks. She posted on Twitter: 'A genuinely astonishing comment from someone who represents an area with almost 30% of children living in poverty. 'It would appear he has no clue of what life is like on the ground for so many of his constituents.' Fellow Labour MP Angela Eagle said Mr Anderson's comments were 'crass and cruel in equal measure'. However, fellow Conservative MP Brendan Clarke-Smith defended his party colleague, insisting Mr Anderson was 'absolutely spot on'. Mr Clarke-Smith also highlighted a newspaper article from last year detailing how he and Mr Anderson had previously promoted a food bank's efforts to show how it was possible to feed a family of five for seven days for PS50.24. The Sunday Express article quoted Mr Anderson as saying he had no pretensions to being a 'great cook' but that he does not mind 'having a dabble'.  He added: 'I was a single parent for about 17 years - two boys living with me, so you learn how to cook cheaply, learn how to cook nice meals and I enjoyed doing it. 'This is all about tackling food poverty. It's about people having nutritious meals. 'It's about tackling obesity as well. If you're going to eat nutritious meals, the chance are you're not going to be overweight.' Last summer, Mr Anderson refused to watch England's games at Euro 2020 in protest at the men's national football team taking the knee before matches in an anti-racism stance. The MP criticised the gesture's association with the Black Lives Matter political movement.

Maddie Thomas vanished without trace from the Southmead area of Bristol last month leading detectives to fear that she may have been abducted. Avon and Somerset Police last night made a nationwide appeal for information about the missing youngster after she had not been seen for 15 days. This morning her heart-broken mother Melanie made her own tearful appeal to Maddie to come home. Speaking from the doorstep of her home, Mum Melanie said: 'Melanie please come home. 'Please get in touch and tell us you are safe.' She added: 'Whatever has happened it doesn't matter. You are not in trouble. We just want you to come home.' Maddie was rescued from a house in Bristol at lunchtime today. There men were arrested at the property on suspicion of abducting the 15-year-old. Detectives then informed Maddie's parents and foster parents that she had been located. Detective Inspector Laura Miller, who lead the man-hunt for Maddie, said: 'We're delighted to confirm Maddie has been found. 'Three men are in police custody and will soon be questioned by officers. 'We're extremely grateful for all the support the public gave us in our search for Maddie and would like to reassure them she is now being provided with all the care and support she needs. 'We appreciate there is significant interest in this case and I'd ask people not to speculate and to think about the impact it may have on Maddie and her loved ones.'", "638b52d542cb82f86ea2d6462a4f2915b96a2ef59827863094e8bcc8": "No10's long-awaited Covid inquiry will examine how badly lockdowns impacted the nation's mental health and children. Officials today revealed the scope of the independent probe would be broadened to include the wider impacts of pandemic restrictions.  There were fears the investigation would fall into the same trap as earlier reports that focused on lives lost directly to Covid and ruled the UK should have locked down for longer.  Since then, data has accrued suggesting the benefits of lockdowns were overblown and the wider consequences were underestimated. The inquiry, which already included 26 topics, is being chaired by Baroness Heather Hallett. She will have the power to summon witnesses to give evidence under oath -- even the Prime Minister.  After reviewing more than 20,000 responses to her original draft terms of reference last month, the main complaint was that they were too narrow. The inquiry will now also examine the pandemic's unequal impact on ethnic minority groups and collaboration between the devolved administrations. Children faced massive disruptions to their education during the pandemic, despite being at a vanishingly small risk of the virus. Psychiatrists have described the pandemic as the 'biggest hit' to mental wellbeing in generations, following a record 4.3million mental health referrals in 2021. Baroness Heather Hallett is no stranger to taking charge of high profile inquests and inquiries. The 71-year-old former Court of Appeal judge has been entrusted by Boris Johnson with chairing the long-awaited public probe into the coronavirus crisis. Her handling of the inquiry will be subject to ferocious scrutiny. But Baroness Hallett, who retired from the Court of Appeal in 2019, has experience of operating in the public eye. She is currently acting as the coroner in the inquest into the death of Dawn Sturgess who died in July 2018 following exposure to the nerve agent Novichok. A new chair for that inquiry is expected to be appointed early in the new year. She previously acted as the coroner for the inquests into the deaths of the 52 victims of the July 7, 2005 London bombings. She also chaired the Iraq Fatalities Investigations as well as the 2014 Hallett Review of the administrative scheme to deal with 'on the runs' in Northern Ireland. Baroness Hallett was nominated for a life peerage in 2019 as part of Theresa May's resignation honours. The married mother-of-two joined the House of Lords as a crossbench life peer. In a letter sent to Boris Johnson today, Baroness Hallett asked to expand the terms of reference to include children and young people, including the impact on health, wellbeing and social care education. It should also examine the 'impacts on mental health' and the wellbeing of the UK population, she said.  And collaboration between officials and charities across the UK's four nations should also be within the inquiry's scope, the letter states. Baroness Hallett also called for a sharper focus on care services provided in people's homes, support for victims of domestic abuse and first contact with the NHS, including 111 and 999 services.  Other topics already included in the scope are Government preparedness, testing, borders, infection control in hospitals and care homes, PPE, vaccines, furlough and sick pay. Baroness Hallett, an ex-Court of Appeal judge who has been involved in other public probes, made the decision to expand the inquiry after meeting with over 150 bereaved families and organisations over a four-week consultation. She said the process 'demonstrated people's passion to be part of the Inquiry and their desire to work with me to ensure valuable lessons are learned'. People voiced concerns about the 'unequal impact of the pandemic', so the inequalities should be at the 'forefront' of the investigation, she added. The inquiry, poised to begin in the next few months, will have the power to summon witnesses to give evidence under oath -- even the Prime Minister. It has been tasked with examining the UK's response to the pandemic, with the goal of ensuring the country learns 'the right lessons for the future'.  Those involved in the investigation will comb through millions of documents relating to the handling of the pandemic.  Campaigners last month called for 'any rule-breaking by any rule-makers', such as Partygate, to be investigated as part of the inquiry. Bereaved Families for Justice (BFJ) said that 'any rule-breaking by any rule-makers' should be investigated. This should include any ministers who 'broke their own restriction rules'.", "6ad8ebbfc0c3ce8b8a5b00c486cdf8693fa0e30d00403020b4ccfecb": "Britons set to enjoy 25C at the weekend thanks to an African plume sweeping across UK before thunderstorms hit over weekend, forecasters say.  The Met Office said parts of England could see weather in its mid-20Cs but has also warned that the end of the wet weather seen during the week is not over.  Forecasters put the sunnier weekend down to a hot weather plume from North Africa which is sweeping hot and dry air across Britain.  But with this balmy weather also brings the danger of thunderstorms - which rely on moisture and warm - as it causes heat to build up. The national weather service has also said there are high pollen counts today that will cause many to sneeze and sniffle as they enjoy the warm weather.    Pollen counts leave hayfever sufferers across the UK left sneezing and rubbing their eyes. But things could get even worse for those Britons who have the condition as grass pollen - which affects 95 per cent of sufferers - reaches its peak. Up to 20million people are expected to be affected this summer by the more than 150 species of grass in the UK. Pollen levels will be very high in central England today, high in other parts of England and moderate to low in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Up to 30 per cent of adults and around 40 per cent of children suffer from hay fever, according to Allergy UK. Those who suffer with the condition are advised to avoid alcohol, wear sunglasses outside, close windows, change clothing regularly and shower to remove pollen from hair and skin. The Met Office told the MailOnline: 'A low pressure system will glance the far north of Scotland on Friday, bringing with it some wind gusts of up to 35 knots on some exposed coasts in the far north.  'Associated with that will be some more persistent rain, especially for western Scotland, although showers will be possible more widely in the north; possibly reaching northern England and Wales for a time on Friday. 'The set up from Saturday is for some largely more settled weather, and potentially the warmest day of the year so far. Saturday will see some patchy cloud around, but temperatures could peak at 24C, topping the 23.6C seen earlier in May.  'The best of the sunshine and highest temperatures are likely to be in the southeast, although much of the UK will have a mild day, with temperatures widely in the low 20s and high teens.  'Some early scattered showers will linger in some of the high ground in Scotland. Overnight into Sunday, there's a chance of some thundery downpours reaching the south of the UK overnight, although the precise positioning and extent is still being determined.  'Currently, it looks as though 20mm of rain could be possible in a 3 hour period for some areas on the south coast of the UK. 'This band of thundery rain will move northeast on Sunday morning, weakening as it does so.  'Despite that early threat of some thundery rain, temperatures will still be fairly mild as warm air is drawn in from Europe.  'Temperatures in the southeast could once again be around 24C, possibly 25C in a few isolated spots. 'Although it's a few days away, the current set up for Monday shows some unsettled weather for some western areas, although temperatures should remain mild.' Today, there were decent spells of sunshine in the morning and there will be bright spells the rest of the day, the Met Office has said.  And some scattered light showers in the afternoon with a maximum temperature of 18C in London and the southeast.  While Scotland and the north will reach highs of 16C and have a few evening showers particularly across the Peak District.  Friday will be a lot hotter and brighter as the weekend gets off to the right start. It will be a bright day with plenty of sunshine and maximum temperature of 23C.  It will also be a windy start to the day that will ease by the end while the outlook for Saturday is similar with a risk of some heavy showers into Sunday. The national weather service explained for the UK that today: 'Most areas dry with sunny spells and cloud bubbling up through the day, probably sunniest in the southeast.  'Northern Ireland and much of Scotland breezy and cloudier with some showery rain at times.' While Friday will be: 'Dry and fine in south with hazy sunshine for most. Very warm in southeast. Cloudier in north with occasional rain across northern and western Scotland, though eastern areas staying dry.  'Mainly fine and warm [at the weekend], locally very warm, with sunny spells. A few showers in the far north Saturday, then showers or rain, some heavy, in the south Sunday or Monday.'  BBC weatherman Tomasz Schafernaker said: 'Thursday into Friday the high pressure starts to build in so this is where the warmer, sunnier weather is to the south of us. 'We've got that more unsettled weather to the north again with hints of rain across parts of western Scotland. But whichever way you look at it, it is really starting to settle down by Friday with widespread sunny skies and temperatures of 20C in London.' Another BBC meterteologist Nick Miller said: 'It will be pleasantly warm [this weekend] especially when you get to see some sunshine, high pressure is close by but that is not the whole story. 'Later Saturday, Saturday night, first thing Sunday there are some showers, some thunderstorms pushing up from the south and into parts of England and Wales, some of those come back Sunday night and into Monday morning.'  There is also a warning of high pollen levels in the UK by the Met Office which could allergy sufferers to sneeze a lot more this week.  The forecaster explained: 'Hay fever is the most common name for pollen allergy and is most commonly caused by grass pollens, although other pollens can also trigger the symptoms. The symptoms are caused when immune system reacts to pollen in the body to produce histamine and other chemicals. 'Around two in every ten people have this allergy and it is thought that more than 10 million people in Britain suffer with hay fever.' Dr Samantha Walker, director of research and policy at Asthma UK, said previously: 'If you have asthma you should check pollen and air pollution forecasts in your local area, make sure you carry your reliever inhaler, and know what to do if your symptoms get worse.  'If you also have hay fever it's important to use a steroid nasal spray every day together with non-drowsy antihistamine tablets as needed.'", "4bd8201171e294fd02b49021ba749e7fbbffa8c1d15c9aae9d8593e0": "Fashion giant Zara is now charging online customers a fee for returns to drop-off points across the country.  The retailer is charging shoppers who wish to return items to third-party drop-off points a PS1.95 fee, which is deducted from the refund sum. However, returns for online orders to the group's stores remain free of charge, the group told This is Money. Recent findings from returns specialist ReBound found that one in three fashion items snapped up online are sent back, which is around double the rate for goods bought in store.  Zara shoppers still have 30 days from the shipping date of their order to return an item purchased online. The items 'must have all their labels and be in perfect condition', the retailer says on its website.   Such a move by a mega-brand like Zara has led to questions over whether charging online shoppers for returns could become the norm in future, particularly amid mounting concerns over sustainability and the environment.  Companies like Zara will also be all too aware of the potential impact bumper returns from online shoppers can have on their bottom lines.  The retail landscape has shifted seismically in the last decade or so, and ordering dresses, bras and even shoes online has become the norm. Yet, this is not a sector without its pitfalls, and returns of online orders have surged, and can be a headache for both shoppers and retailers.  Swathes of returns from online orders can also, in some instances, hit a retailer's finances.  Findings from returns management company NShift have claimed it costs businesses an average of PS20 to deal with each online return, taking into account everything from shipping and storage to repackaging and discounting. Earlier this month, online-based fashion retailer Boohoo revealed that profits had taken a hit from online shoppers returning clothes at a faster rate than before the pandemic. Boohoo's pre-tax profit slumped by 94 per cent to PS7.8million in the year to the end of February. Its sales are still well above pre-Covid levels, however, after high streets closed and shoppers turned to ordering online. But since restrictions were lifted customers have flocked back to physical stores and Boohoo says its online shoppers are sending more items back. Some retailers like Asos have said they will block 'serial returners' from their online shop, while Marks & Spencer has also said it will contact customers sending back an unusually high number of online orders.  Plus, certain businesses already charge for the shipment or collection of returns for online orders.  At Wayfair, for example, the return shipping charge can vary between PS4.99 and PS9.99 for small parcel courier services and from PS20 and PS50 for large parcel courier services.  Recent research from parcelLab, which examined 200 of the UK's top retailers, found that 76 per cent of brands continued to offer free returns, despite having made certain commitments about sustainability.  The findings also suggested that over a quarter of Britons would opt for one brand over another if they conveyed strong sustainability commitments, adding that nine in 10 retailers did not promote paperless returns.  Tobias Buxhoidt, chief executive and co-founder of parcelLab, told This is Money: 'It is important to strike a balance between offering the consumer convenience while also limiting the impact the notoriously damaging returns process has on the environment.  The proliferation of the 'serial returner' has become a real issue for major retailers, so it comes as no surprise Zara are now introducing a PS1.95 charge to return orders - and it is likely other major retailers will follow in the footsteps of Zara.  'If retailers are to begin charging for returns, then this then becomes a paid for service and must be fast, efficient, and directly communicated to the consumer. Retailers' attention to their environmental impact must be coupled with first class customer experience if charges are to implemented by brands more widely.'", "2d62d7790017442863033ad8c2f17fe1c89e82b3960179821ca457b3": "A luxury superyacht owned by the man who transformed Starbucks from a Seattle coffee bean store into a global brand has arrived in UK waters.  The vessel, named Pi, is worth an estimated PS118 million and was spotted entering Falmouth harbour yesterday morning before moving to Pendennis Shipyard later in the afternoon. The ship was built in 2019 by a Dutch company named Feadship. It is the 21st largest vessel the company has ever made with dimensions of 254ft in length and 37ft wide, positioning it as the 195th largest yacht in the world. With two engines, it can reach speeds of 18.4 knots. It is owned by Howard Schultz, ranked by Forbes magazine as the 209th richest person in the world, with a net worth of PS3.68billion. Pi can host up to 12 guests and 18 crew members and has its own helicopter pad, glass-bottomed swimming pool and onboard spa facilities. It belongs to the American businessman who bought the coffee chain in the 1980s. He is ranked by Forbes as the 209th richest person in the world, with a net worth of PS3.68bn. The 68-year-old is currently chief executive of the company, a job he has also filled previously. It is likely that the superyacht is undergoing some work at Pendennis Shipyard, which is one of the world's leading superyacht refit and custom build facilities. The site employs over 450 skilled tradespeople and has completed more than 300 refit projects and 30 custom-made build projects on some of the most iconic yachts in the world. Schultz is credited as Starbucks' founder despite the company being founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker at Seattle's Pike Place Market.  Back then, Starbucks was merely a coffee bean store but it became a full-fledged cafe after Schultz bought it in the early 1980s. Later he transformed it into the international coffee shop brand.  The businessman made most of his billion-dollar fortune thanks to Starbucks. He served as the chief executive officer from 1986 to 2000 and returned during the financial crisis of 2007-08.", "6b4e77f5bfc15780994a59a077600c9aa86d891c924fc9c470f85028": "Watching your child take their first steps is meant to be one of the most exciting milestones as a new parent. But for Natasha and Alex Finney, their elation soon turned to horror after spotting what turned out to be cancer in their 11-month-old. As AJ walked unaided for the first time, they noticed he had an unusual cloudiness in his right eye. Alarmed, they took him to see doctors, who rushed through tests and diagnosed him with retinoblastoma. Due to the size of the infant's cancer, medics had to remove his eye straight away in a three-hour operation -- one day after his first birthday.  AJ, from Bolton, now has one artificial eye following the procedure in December. Mrs Finney told MailOnline her son is doing 'amazingly well' considering everything he has been through. The teacher, 29, said her son is a 'happy little boy who is now up on his feet, walking around everywhere and developing a cheeky, contagious personality'. Retinoblastoma is a rare type of eye cancer that can affect young children, usually under the age of 5.   Its symptoms include an unusual white reflection in the pupil, a squint, a red or inflamed eye and poor vision. Retinoblastoma happens when retina eye cells -- which are supposed to grow very quickly and then stop growing during a baby's early development -- continue to grow and form a cancer.  Depending on the size of the tumour. If it is small, laser and freezing treatments that aim to destroy the tumour will be carried out. If it is larger, youngsters may undergo surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  Some children may suffer sight loss or need to have their eye removed.  Between 40 and 50 cases of retinoblastoma are diagnosed in the UK every year. The figure equates to one in 15,000 to 20,000 newborns. Around four in 10 cases are diagnosed in the first year of life and incidence rates drop to a very low rate after five years of age.  Around two-thirds of retinoblastomas are diagnosed in one eye only.  More than nine in 10 cases are detected early and cured before the cancer spreads outside the eyeball.  Source: NHS, Children with Cancer UK Speaking of the day they were first alerted to AJ's retinoblastoma, Mrs Finney said: 'While changing AJ's nappy, he cried a lot.  'When he got up, taking his first steps in the process, we were over the moon. 'But then we noticed a cloudiness in his eye and decided to get him into the doctors that day.' AJ was referred to a specialist eye hospital by his doctor, where he had vision tests, pressure readings and ultrasound scans.  The consultant thought it could be retinoblastoma, a tumour in the retina that can be seen through the pupil. Mrs Finney and her partner, a commercial agent, were told not to Google the cancer but they decided they needed to know more about their son's condition. She said: 'The standout word was 'cancer'. Our hearts sunk lower than we knew was possible, we were devastated.'  Typical retinoblastoma symptoms include a squint, a change in iris colour, a red or inflamed eye and poor vision. They can also include an unusual white reflection in the pupil, sometimes referred to as a cat's eye.  When the tumour forms, light reflects off the cancer's surface, causing the child's dilated pupil to appear white in flash photos or dim light. Retinoblastoma happens when retina eye cells fail to stop growing during a baby's development, forming a tumour.  Between 40 and 50 cases of retinoblastoma are diagnosed in the UK every year, equating to one in 15,000 to 20,000 newborns.  If the tumour is small, laser and freezing treatments will be carried out to destroy it. If it is larger, youngsters may undergo surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Some children may suffer sight loss or need to have their eye removed. Mrs Finney said: 'We weren't aware of retinoblastoma before AJ was diagnosed, so we wouldn't have known any typical signs or symptoms of it. 'Although AJ had a visible squint quite early on, we weren't concerned as Alex and his mum also have a slight squint, so we assumed it was hereditary.  'Since AJ's diagnosis, we have discovered that a squint is the second most common sign of retinoblastoma'.  The week after his tests in late November, the family travelled to the specialist retinoblastoma ward at Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital to have AJ's eyes examined under anaesthetic, where the retinoblastoma diagnosis was confirmed. Mrs Finney said: 'We weren't really given any other option other than removal of his right eye, purely due to the size of AJ's tumour.  'Alex and I were devastated, and it took us a while to digest what we were being told.' AJ had his right eye removed the day after his first birthday in a three-hour procedure. His mother said it 'felt like the longest three hours' of their lives but it was a 'huge relief' when surgeons said the operation had been a success.  Medics were able to remove all of his cancer, meaning he does not require regular medication or treatment.   She said: 'When we collected him from recovery, it was bittersweet as we were so excited to have him back with us, but equally it was hard to see him all bandaged up.'  The one-year-old stayed in hospital for five days, with his parents only allowed to be with him for one hour each day due to Covid restrictions. Mrs Finney said it was 'really difficult to accept' that her son would go through life partially sighted. She said: 'The first thing that people would notice was 'his beautiful eyes' and although I knew that he would always be beautiful to our family, I became conscious that it wouldn't be the first thing people noticed about him anymore. 'However, even now, people will comment on AJ's beautiful eyes as well as his cheeky smile. As long as we know that AJ is happy, we are happy too.' She said that strangers have been left 'amazed' when they have been told one of his eyes is artificial and one little girl called it his 'magic eye'.  Mrs Finney said her family feels 'extremely lucky' that AJ's left eye is healthy at the moment but they remain 'extremely vigilant for any signs of changes'. She said: 'Having vision in one eye only hasn't seemed to affect him too much, but he bumps into door frames from time to time. 'He is very much a lefty now - choosing to do almost every one-handed task with his left hand but as this is the side where he has vision, we can understand that and are constantly tweaking our parenting to suit AJ's needs, such as sitting him on our right knee to do peekaboo on his left hand side.' Mrs Finney said: 'As a one-year-old, AJ is a happy little boy who is now up on his feet, walking around everywhere and developing a cheeky, contagious personality day-by-day. 'He loves to clap hands and make a mess of the front room by emptying his ball pit, launching three balls across the room at a time - all 300 of them.' She said: 'For myself and Alex, it's been difficult to comprehend what we've been through, partly because it has all happened so fast so we've had new information to digest quite regularly throughout the last few months.' AJ's seven-year-old sister Alice has been 'amazing' at adapting to having a partially-sighted sibling and  , Mrs Finney said.  'AJ's sister, Alice (7) has been amazing at just adapting to having a partially sighted sibling and understanding that he requires a lot of care and attention - we're extremely proud of her!  The Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT) is urging parents to be on the lookout for the cancer. Patrick Tonks, chief executive of CHECT said: 'Symptoms can be quite subtle, and children often seem well in themselves which can make it hard to diagnose.   'We are extremely grateful that in AJ's case, his symptoms were recognised, and an urgent referral was made so that he could receive treatment.' In a message to other parents, Mrs Finney said: 'If anyone is worried that their child has retinoblastoma, please go to your GP as soon as possible but don't panic.  'There are so many different scenarios when it comes to retinoblastoma and the treatment that AJ has received is completely different to that of other retinoblastoma warriors that we are now in contact with.  'The retinoblastoma community is strong and there is always someone there to chat to whenever you're feeling lonely, worried or anxious'.

The mother-of-two, 40, announced in a statement that her and Prince Harry's Archewell Foundation is launching a 'National Business Coalition for Child Care,' in collaboration with the Marshall Plan for Moms charity, in the hope of pushing for more childcare solutions in the business world.  The Duchess of Sussex, who lives in Montecito with Harry, 37, their son Archie, three and their ten-months-old daughter Lilibet, is advocating for companies to listen to the needs of their employees in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement, the California-native said working mothers 'shoulder so much' since Covid-19.  The Marshall Plan for Moms is a US-based charity pushing for more flexibility and policies in the workplace to help working mothers juggling careers and parenting duties.  'Families everywhere, and especially working moms, are asked to shoulder so much,' Meghan said.  'This has only been heightened by the pandemic, with increased caregiving responsibilities, rising prices, and economic uncertainty. As it's been said many times, it takes a village to raise a child,' she added.  'Today, we're sending a message that childcare isn't just a community imperative--it's a business imperative,' she added. 'Creating a stronger workforce starts with meeting the needs of families.' According to research for the Marshall Plan for Moms in partnership with McKinsey & Company, 69 per cent of mothers with children under five are more likely to go for employers who offer on-site childcare or financial aid to pay for childcare.  Other organisations joining the coalition include, Patagonia, Athletes Unlimited. and Fast Retailing, which owns Uniqlo, Comptoir des Cotonniers, GU, Princesse Tam-Tam, and Theory.  Members will work to pursue solutions to provide childcare and support for their employees.  They have also vowed to demonstrate how they are taking spaces to that effect within their organisations, and to share their policies, data and practices to show how they are tackling the issue internally.  They will also speak out publicly about the importance of childcare in the US economic landscape.   It is not the first time Meghan has come out as a parenting advocate.  Last year, she made a political statement as she wrote a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer advocating for paid family leave. 'I'm not an elected official, and I'm not a politician,' Markle, who is long rumored to be keen on a career in politics, wrote. 'I'm writing to you at this deeply important time - as a mom - to advocate for paid leave.' The extraordinary 1,030-word letter - handed out to supportive media to share - asked Pelosi and Schumer to consider her plea 'on behalf of my family, Archie and Lili and Harry'. The duchess depicted humble beginnings, saying that her family struggled when she was young despite her well-documented middle class upbringing in which she attended private primary and secondary schools on her Emmy award-winning lighting director father's $200,000-a-year salary. And she now lives in a $14million sprawling mansion in Montecito, California, complete with designer touches and has signed a series of lucrative deals with Spotify and Netflix thought to be worth well over $150million. The news of this new Archewell ventures comes as it was confirmed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would take part in the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in the UK come June. A spokesperson for the couple said:  'Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are excited and honored to attend The Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations this June with their children.' However, it was announced that Harry and Meghan, alongside his cousins and several other members of the royal family, won't make an appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during their visit.  The balcony appearance, which is often seen as the centrepiece of major royal occasions, including Trooping the Colour and weddings, usually sees the Queen's extended family gather to watch a flypast and is a rare chance for fans to see the entire extended family together. Following his ejection from public life, after settling a civil court case in America over allegations of sexual abuse against Virginia Giuffre (which he vehemently denies), it was inconceivable that Beatrice and Eugenie's father Prince Andrew would be given a spot.  Despite earlier claims that the Queen offered Prince Harry and Meghan Markle a space on the platform, they too have been left off the list, although they quickly announced today that they will be in London for the celebrations with their two children.  1.

The wife of Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, 40, opted for a white and blue vintage PS1,316 Chanel patterned dress for day three of the PS3million Wagatha Christie libel trial. She paired the statement frock with a PS650 tote bag from Aspinal of London, noted as one of the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite handbag designers, as well as a PS556 blazer from Veronica Beard - a US brand which has previously been worn by Meghan Markle. Meanwhile, Coleen Rooney looked ready for business in an all-black blouse and trousers combo, which she teamed with one loafer; she has been sporting an air boot on her other foot since suffering a fracture after a fall at home in March. Superstar footballer Wayne Rooney's wife Coleen, 36, opted for a PS580 blouse from French fashion brand Isabel Marant, which featured a round neck and puff sleeves.  Coleen has been in a bitter feud with Rebekah since October 2019 after accusing her of leaking 'false stories' about her private life to the media, before claiming that she uncovered the culprit after carrying out a social media 'sting operation'.  Used to wearing glamorous attire on lavish holidays and to swanky nightclubs, the high-profile WAGS swapped their usual uniforms of cocktail dresses and swimwear for smart business style today. Turning up for the third day of proceedings, Rebekah, who has five children as well as a step-daughter from husband Jamie's previous relationship, wore her brown hair scraped back into a bun. She sported a natural make-up look with a light layer of foundation and a pink lip look, while opting for a pair of black sunglasses. Her vintage Chanel patterned dress featured a thick white stripe around her waist to showcase her svelte figure and was teamed with blue heels. The 2018 knit frock also has short sleeves and boasts a small CC logo.  She paired it with Veronica Beard's signature midnight-blue 'Miller Dickey' blazer, which has a double-breasted silhouette and padded shoulders to balance the nipped-in waist. The brand was worn by the Duchess of Sussex in October 2018 and September 2019, when she sported one of the designer's blue frocks, first in Tonga, then in Cape Town. Rebekah finisher her outfit with dainty silver earrings and carried Aspinal of London's London Tote. The brand is a favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge, Pippa Middleton and the Duchess of Cornwall. This isn't the first time this week that Rebekah has opted to attend court wearing brands loved by Kate Middleton.   Yesterday she wore an Alexander McQueen blazer and on Tuesday she donned a midi shirt dress from a British-Canadian designer Edeline Lee, who marks the Duchess among her fans. Meanwhile, Coleen opted for an all-black ensemble when attending court today alongside her husband Wayne. Adding a touch of glitz to her attire, she opted for golden hoops while keeping her hair in a half-up half-down style. The mother-of-four, who was wearing a medical boot on her left leg for an injury, completed her look with a black handbag. Coleen's barrister today joked that Rebekah had been 'saved by the bell' as he opened day three of the PS3million Wagatha Christie libel showdown after her testimony was cut short by a fire alarm yesterday.  Addressing Rebekah, David Sherborne said: 'Can we Mrs Vardy start where we left off yesterday before you were saved by the bell.' He went on to quiz her about a night out with the Wags in St Petersburg during the 2018 World Cup. She denied giving a photographer the location of the restaurant where the nine wives and girlfriends were having a night out. But asked for details, she said: 'If I'm completely honest I had been drinking quite a bit.'  In response, Coleen's barrister Mr Sherborne dramatically accused her of lying, saying: 'Mrs Vardy, this is the first time that you have suggested that your recollection of events has been affected by drinking - that's a lie, isn't it?'  The libel trial has heard extraordinary details of life inside the Wags' bubble, including lurid claims of extramarital affairs, bitter rivalries and back-stabbing. The case centres around a 2019 social media post by Coleen in which she said she had planted fake stories on her private Instagram account and accused Rebekah of leaking them to The Sun newspaper. Rebekah denied the claim, and launched a libel case when Coleen refused to take down the post. Yesterday, Rebekah was confronted with messages in which she discussed leaking and selling stories, and faced repeated accusations that she was lying to the court to protect the 'last shred' of her case against Coleen. She rejected accusations she had revealed 'juicy information' to settle scores with rival Wags, while courting positive publicity by arranging staged photographs and interviews to promote her image. Rebekah, a mother-of-five, broke down in tears as she was confronted with one such interview, in which she told how vile online trolls had threatened to rape her daughter.  September 2017 to October 2019 - The Sun runs a number of articles about Coleen, including that she travelled to Mexico to look into baby 'gender selection' treatment, her plan to revive her TV career and the flooding of her basement. October 9, 2019 - Coleen uses social media to accuse Rebekah of selling stories from her private Instagram account to the tabloids. Coleen says she spent five months attempting to work out who was sharing information about her and her family based on posts she had made on her personal social media page. After sharing a series of 'false' stories and using a process of elimination, Coleen claims they were viewed by one Instagram account, belonging to Rebekah. Rebekah, then pregnant with her fifth child, denies the allegations and says various people had access to her Instagram over the years. She claims to be 'so upset' by Coleen's accusation, later adding: 'I thought she was my friend but she completely annihilated me.' The public dispute makes headlines around the world, with the hashtag #WagathaChristie trending. February 13, 2020 - In a tearful appearance on ITV's Loose Women, Rebekah says the stress of the dispute caused her to have severe anxiety attacks and she 'ended up in hospital three times'. Coleen says in a statement that she does not want to 'engage in further public debate'. June 23, 2020 - It emerges that Rebekah has launched libel proceedings against Coleen. Rebekah's lawyers allege she 'suffered extreme distress, hurt, anxiety and embarrassment as a result of the publication of the post and the events which followed'. November 19-20, 2020 - The libel battle has its first High Court hearing in London. A judge rules that Coleen's October 2019 post 'clearly identified' Rebekah as being 'guilty of the serious and consistent breach of trust'. Mr Justice Warby concludes that the 'natural and ordinary' meaning of the posts was that Rebekah had 'regularly and frequently abused her status as a trusted follower of Coleen's personal Instagram account by secretly informing The Sun of Coleen's private posts and stories'. February 8-9, 2022 - A series of explosive messages between Rebekah and her agent Caroline Watt - which Coleen's lawyers allege were about her - are revealed at a preliminary court hearing. The court is told Rebekah was not referring to Coleen when she called someone a 'nasty bitch' in one exchange with Ms Watt. Coleen's lawyers seek further information from the WhatsApp messages, but the court is told that Ms Watt's phone fell into the North Sea after a boat she was on hit a wave, before further information could be extracted from it. February 14 - Coleen is refused permission to bring a High Court claim against Ms Watt for misuse of private information to be heard alongside the libel battle. A High Court judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, says the bid was brought too late and previous opportunities to make the claim had not been taken. April 13 - Ms Watt is not fit to give oral evidence at the upcoming libel trial, the High Court is told as the case returns for another hearing. The agent revokes permission for her witness statement to be used, and withdraws her waiver which would have allowed Sun journalists to say whether she was a source of the allegedly leaked stories. April 29 - Rebekah 'appears to accept' that her agent was the source of allegedly leaked stories, Coleen's barrister David Sherborne tells the High Court. He argues that a new witness statement submitted by Rebekah suggests Ms Watt was the source but Rebekah claims she 'did not authorise or condone her'. Rebekah's lawyer Hugh Tomlinson says the statement did not contain 'any change whatever in the pleaded case', with her legal team having no communication with Ms Watt. May 10 onwards - The trial begins.  ", "f647d9fa083aa8b8af18097ccf031be58cfb9a14d5b224b6783b129b": "A Carlsberg director was sacked after successfully organising a 'p**s up' in a brewery because it breached lockdown rules, an employment tribunal has heard. Martin Entwistle invited eight friends for beers in the Taproom of Carlsberg's London Fields Brewery (LFB) in Hackney, north London, on 6 June 2020 despite strict Covid regulations having been enforced due to a 'vulnerable' member of staff. An employment tribunal hearing, in Cambridge, was told that after dinner and drinks he gave his friends a late-night 'guided tour' of the London brewery which descended into 'boisterous, alcohol-fuelled horseplay'. Their escapades were captured on CCTV and as a result he was told his behaviour was 'unbecoming' of a managing director and he was sacked for gross misconduct. Mr Entwistle, who now runs online retailer All About The Beer, then brought claims of unfair dismissal and breach of contract against Carlsberg, saying enforced rules were put across on an email as 'nothing more' than 'guidelines'. But the tribunal has now dismissed his claims - saying the regulations were 'clear and unmistakable' as mandatory rules and not voluntary guidance.  Mr Entwistle had worked as the Managing Director of Danish brewing company Carlsberg's LFB and Taproom in Hackney, north London. In light of the Covid 19 pandemic, the company had introduced measures to reduce the risk of infection at the site. At the time of the drink up on 6 June 2020, restrictions had just been lifted from a complete lockdown, with the public able to meet up to six people in an outdoor setting and only two people were allowed to meet indoors, in both cases while being socially distanced. Larger gatherings were only permitted for work purposes, provision of voluntary or charitable services or at an educational facility where the gathering is 'reasonably necessary' for the purposes of education. Non-essential retail shops were not to open for another 11 days.  The tribunal also heard that in preparing for the return of a 'vulnerable' female member of staff - named only as 'K' - the company had detailed extra rules in an email sent to all employees. The 'mandatory directives' enforced in June included 'no one' being allowed to enter the brewery area 'unless there is an emergency'. The rules added: 'This includes when the Brew Team are not at work, and should generally be the case regardless.' The tribunal noted it showed no one was wearing face masks, and that 'at least one' of the party had engaged in 'boisterous, alcohol-fuelled horseplay' whilst in the brewery. After the party, a number of staff raised concerns about their managing director's conduct, and a disciplinary investigation began. The investigation found Mr Entwistle had 'demonstrated ignorance' of social distancing guidelines and 'failed to control the behaviour' of his friends. But despite accepting he 'had not set a good example', Mr Entwistle disagreed that his conduct was 'unbecoming' of the lead of the LFB operation. The tribunal also heard he challenged the 'validity' of the Covid measures sent in the earlier email, arguing they were simply 'guidance and nothing more'. Mr Entwistle sought to 'justify' his entry to the brewery by saying he knew vulnerable staff member 'K' - who had been shielding for three months prior to her return - wouldn't be at work for another four days. In September 2020 he was sacked for his 'extremely irresponsible' act of gross misconduct, and told he had committed a 'very serious error of judgement'. Mr Entwistle appealed the decision, arguing that while it had been 'wrong' to take a group into the brewery it had not caused 'any danger or risk to any employee or visitors'. His appeal was rejected and he brought claims of unfair dismissal and breach of contract to an employment tribunal. However, Employment Judge Claude Forde dismissed his claims and concluded that the Covid rules regarding the brewhouse were 'unmistakably' mandatory rules. The LFB is located under railway arches, boasts a 15-hectolitre (1,500 litres) brew kit, has a 3,000 hectolitre (300,000 litres) onsite capacity and, in 2011, was the first commercial brewery to open in Hackney in over a century. It was bought by the Carlsberg Marston's Brewing Company for a reported PS4m in 2017, and shut in December last year. Judge Forde said: 'I find that the information set out in the [June] email contained rules that were clear and unmistakable in terms of their intention and purpose. 'Staff working at LFB on the night in question for whom Mr Entwistle had responsibility were alarmed and concerned at his actions; such that they raised their concerns with those that manage him. 'I find that the acts of Mr Entwistle while in the brewery and in the days after amount to a clear and substantial breach of the contract of employment. 'His decision to contravene the rule regarding unauthorised entry to the brewery, his failure to have regard to the health and safety of his fellow employees and his attempts to post-rationalise his action after the event are all serious matters. 'In other words, his actions - as I have identified individually and cumulatively - amounted to gross misconduct.' The London Fields Brewery was shut down by Carlsberg Marston's Brewing Company in December last year after it decided to sell the brand.", "4affa04c90b15dc8e338de9e783ff73e21f9a88feb30448f026095b2": "A furloughed couple were 'unfairly' dismissed - after being made redundant in the first coronavirus lockdown. Lorry driver David Pointon and sales administrator Jessica Thursfield took kitchen appliance supplier Swift Electrical Wholesalers to an employment tribunal after being made redundant. Two other axed employees from the company, which is based on an industrial complex in Fenton, near Stoke-on-Trent, were also included in the case heard at Birmingham County Court. Now a judge has ruled that all four employees were 'unfairly' dismissed - with three of them sharing PS8,000 compensation. David says he and Jessica were both made redundant just two months after being furloughed in 2020. The 50-year-old says agency workers were hired just a week later. David, who had worked for the company for 15 years, said: 'At the time of being furloughed the Government is giving you 80 per cent of your money. 'But in my house, it was myself and my partner so we were losing 40 per cent of our income collectively. 'It was difficult and uncertain because you didn't know what was going to happen but you did feel like your job was safe. It was due to the coronavirus pandemic that we got furloughed. 'We got letters in the post saying we were up for redundancy. I was shocked because I had never had a day off sick since I'd been there, I'd had no time off, and had a good record with the customers.  'In my opinion, the scoring systems used to get rid of people were unfair.' The tribunal heard that the company, which provides national trade distribution service to kitchen studios, electrical appliance retailers, and builders merchants 'essentially' had new owners from March 2019. During 2019 and into early 2020, the tribunal heard the management was looking at the business with a view to making efficiency savings, particularly in light of the March 2020 Covid lockdown. The tribunal heard by May that year, 45 out of the company's 61 employees had been put on furlough, including Mr Pointon and his partner. According to the tribunal, it was at this point that management had decided redundancies were 'necessary' and at risk staff were informed via a letter in June that the company was considering cut backs.   Employment Judge Christopher Camp, in his ruling, wrote: '(These) letters were a little disingenuous, in that it is clear from the respondent's own evidence that by the time these letters were written, redundancies were not merely a possibility - specific numbers of redundancies in specific areas had been planned.' The company then held face-to-face meetings with three of the tribunal claimants, while Mr Pointon had a telephone interview, in management discussed redundancies with staff - including a scoring system to inform the selection process. According to the tribunal, the scoring system included areas such as length of service, disciplinary record and approach to customer service. After the scoring process, the four staff were among those selected for redundancy. In his judgment, Judge Camp said the company had in the case of one of the claimants 'unnecessarily rushed' the warning of a possibility to notification within three working days. He also criticised the 'lack of any real or any adequate consultation' over the redundancy scoring system with employees, as well as the 'apparent absence' of consideration of voluntary redundancies or of furlough or of job-sharing as an alternative to redundancy. 'In my view, these factors by themselves make these dismissals unfair,' said Judge Camp. Jessica was not eligible for compensation, despite being 'unfairly dismissed', because the judge ruled she would have likely been made redundant even if fair process was followed.  Determined David, from Berryhill, has since described the court ruling as 'brilliant and fantastic'. He now works at JCB. He added: 'I decided, on behalf of myself and the other three people including my partner, to take it to a tribunal for unfair dismissal.  'We saw it as a culling. We couldn't afford any expensive solicitors for the tribunal so I took it upon myself. 'The outcome was brilliant and fantastic. I put a lot of work in. We got compensation judging on the situation.  'Due to Covid it gets reduced to 40 per cent. We got paid out and I bought myself a number plate for my car. 'We were over the moon. At the end of the day it wasn't about the money, it was about proving a point.' David told Stoke-on-Trent Live: 'It wouldn't surprise me if there are hundreds of people up and down the country in the same situation and I say 'don't be afraid'.  'If you think you have been mistreated then get onto ACAS straight away. You will need an ACAS reference number to carry on with the case. Take the company to a tribunal. 'There were times - we got a letter saying we might end up with PS25,000 court fees - when we were thinking how would we be able to pay that? But we believed we were right, put our faith in the justice system, and prevailed.' Swift Electrical Wholesalers has declined to comment on the case when approached by Stoke-on-Trent Live.", "cfad5f528a2457bd015fbdfe8f6634bfbae74c2cabf3a38b598b72b7": "The Duchess of Cambridge showed off her puzzling skills yesterday, when she helped a student crack a crossword clue - and was reportedly 'thrilled' to get it right. Kate Middleton, 40, and her husband Prince William, 39, visited Glasgow during the first day of their two-day Platinum Jubilee tour of Scotland. According to the Times, second year statistics undergraduate Jack Baird, 21, caught the royal's attention when he waved a copy of the old puzzle in the air, and asked for her help with the one clue he hadn't managed to answer.  The crossword fan, who has been known to take the puzzles to nightclubs, was unable to answer a question about the Royal Family, so Kate offered to help him and grabbed the puzzle before being snapped studying it keenly.  The clue Jack was stuck on, seven down, was about the 'sovereign's annual allowance', and contained two words of four and five letters.  Jack said that Kate was able to succesfully provide the correct answer, which was Civil List.  'She was very excited. It didn't look like she was going to get it for a moment. I'm really chuffed. I'm going to frame it. She looked thrilled. I think she thought, 'I wouldn't live this down if I get this wrong'.' While at the university, Kate and William spoke with students about mental health and wellbeing, with their visit taking place during Mental Health Awareness Week. During their day in Glasgow, as well as meeting with university students, Kate and William also visited St John's Primary School in Port Glasgow. There, they took part in a Roots of Empathy session, which involved pupils interacting with a mother and her young baby as they learn how to build their understanding of the baby's needs and emotions. Afterwards, they spoke with students and teachers taking part in the initiative, as well as chatting with some of the older students who have completed the programme to hear their reflections and experiences and understand how the sessions have benefitted them.  After their visit to the school, the Duke and Duchess surprised tenants of Wheatley Homes Glasgow, part of Wheatley Group, during a walkabout at Kennishead in the south side of the city.  They heard about the work carried out by Scotland's leading housing, care and property-management group to tackle homelessness and support vulnerable tenants during the cost of living crisis.  They also met children who are benefiting from free reading books thanks to a partnership between Wheatley Foundation and Dolly Parton's Imagination Library.  The Duke and Duchess were met in Kennishead by John MacLeod, Glasgow Deputy Lieutenant, accompanied by his wife, Mariella McLeod. They were introduced to Wheatley Group Chief Executive Martin Armstrong, Wheatley Group Chair Jo Armstrong and Bernadette Hewitt, the tenant Chair of Wheatley Homes Glasgow. Wheatley Group Chair Jo Armstrong said: 'We were delighted to welcome the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and show them how Wheatley Group is 'Making Homes and Lives Better'. 'They were very interested in the work of our Foundation, about how Wheatley is giving young people the best start in life and also how we are creating new job and training opportunities so customers can reach their full potential. We also explained how Wheatley is playing a key role across Scotland in tackling homelessness and giving people a home of their own.' Kate and William's Scottish tour comes ahead of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, which are set to kick off on Thursday, June 2 with the Queen's birthday parade, which has marked the official birthday of the British sovereign for 260 years, and will end with the Royal Family on the Buckingham Palace balcony and a spectacular flypast. Beacons will also be lit through the UK and Commonwealth, with a special ceremony held at Buckingham Palace. A towering, living sculpture of trees will be lit and projections cast on to the front of Buckingham Palace to highlight the Royal Family's long history of championing environmental causes. On Friday, June 3, a service of thanksgiving will be held at St Paul's Cathedral, which the Queen plans to attend. Arrangements have been tailored for her comfort, however. There will be no ceremonial journey from the palace, while the 96-year-old monarch, who is facing mobility issues, will use a different entrance so she does not have to scale the steep steps. On Saturday, June 4, the Queen intends to attend the Epsom Derby, and in the evening attention will turn again to Buckingham Palace for the Platinum Party at the Palace. Stars of stage, screen and pop and rock will perform in front of a crowd of 22,000 people. On the final day of celebrations, on Sunday, June 5, 60,000 Big Jubilee Lunches will be held across the country and the Commonwealth - ranging from world record attempts for the longest street party to simple back garden barbecues - to encourage community-led events. Final decisions on the Queen's appearances across the weekend are not likely to be announced until the day they are due, Buckingham Palace said.", "0eef867f1dbb0dcaa3bf6260c1d94d079d1f121d1c1104cabb7a5276": "Families have been left outraged after being asked to ditch traditional nursery rhymes for an ultra-woke modernisation that sees pigs go 'shopping' instead of the 'market' and sheep refuse to give their 'wool' because 'it's not cool'.  Animal rights group PETA has claimed the original ballads encourage unfair attitudes towards animals and have been given a 'much-needed makeover to replace racist, sexist, and otherwise insensitive language'.  Parents have since taken to social media to blast the 'ridiculous' vegan adaptations- with one user saying the animal charity is 'brainwashing' children and has 'gone too far'. Hazel Tanner wrote: 'What utter twaddle and these idiots are teaching our children. Brainwashing them actually!'   Baa, Baa, Black Sheep, which parents and teachers sing to children, traditionally starts 'Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool?' But in a new version the sheep explains it's 'not cool' to steal wool and refuses to provide any for the 'pastor', dame or little boy who lives down the lane. Meanwhile, the line in Little Miss Muffet which tells of a girl being 'frightened away' by a spider has been changed to say it 'brightened Miss Muffet's day!'  Miss Muffet has also become vegan in the updated version - instead of eating 'curds and whey', she is 'watching the bluebirds play'. Plus, in the beloved children's rhyme 'This Little Piggy', the mention of 'roast beef' becomes 'roast beets' to promote a plant-based diet. And in Three Blind Mice, the line 'They all ran after the farmer's wife who cut off their tails with a carving knife' has been scrapped. It is replaced with the mice still running after the farmer's wife but the next lines are: 'They told her 'thank you' for saving their life. Did you ever see someone acting so nice as three blind mice?' In response to the nursery rhymes, Jeanette Hill wrote: 'For heavens sake... they are nursery rhythms that we have sung to our children forever. 'If you want the 'woke' version by all means use it in your own household - but leave the rest of us alone.' Ben Clements added: 'It's going to be a very cold country we live in with all these snowflakes'.  Lisa Jane Clancy added: 'That's insane - the world has gone nuts.'  The changes to the rhymes have been made by PETA who say the traditional versions promote outdated attitudes. Elisa Allen, of PETA, said: 'Words matter and nursery rhymes that make light of cruelty to animals or contain archaic, negative depictions of them need a modern overhaul.' She added: 'Small changes like Peta's can instil empathy and compassion. Since humanity is increasingly realising that animals are not ours to exploit, the songs we sing to our children - who absorb everything they see and hear - must reflect these values.' The rewritten rhymes, which are featured on the PETA website, are part of a trend of woke children's literature, which includes gender-swap fairytales. In 2014, the original rhyme 'Baa Baa Black Sheep' was also caught in controversy over suggestions his rhyme was racist - although scholars have since acknowledged it is unlikely the fable has any links to slavery or historic racism. The re-imagined tales come among an influx of woke story books and picture books peddled to kids, including gender-swap fairytales and 'My First Little Book of Intersectional Activism'. Baa, Baa, Black Sheep (original): Bah, Bah, a black Sheep, Have you any wool? Yes old mate I have Three bags full, Two for my master, One for my dame, None for the little boy That cries in the lane Little Miss Muffet (original):  Little Miss Muffet Sat on a tuffet, Eating her curds and whey; There came a big spider, Who sat down beside her And frightened Miss Muffet away Pop Goes the Weasel (original):  Half a pound of tuppenny rice, Half a pound of treacle. That's the way the money goes, Pop! goes the weasel Three blind mice (original): Three blind mice. Three blind mice. See how they run. See how they run. They all ran after the farmer's wife, Who cut off their tails with a carving knife, Did you ever see such a sight in your life, As three blind mice? This Little Piggy (original): This little piggy went to market, This little piggy stayed home, This little piggy had roast beef, This little piggy had none, And this little piggy cried 'wee wee wee' all the way home.

The four-day conference in a luxury resort for leading creators and investors in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies featured talks by spotty computer nerds and such well-known financial luminaries as Tony Blair and Gisele Bundchen. Actor Orlando Bloom and his pop singer wife Katy Perry were among other celebrities who flew in for a private dinner with fellow investors. In between sessions with titles such as 'Winning' and 'How Crypto Empowers Global Citizens', attendees could attend 'Sunrise Yoga' and a 'VIP pool party'. The mood was self-congratulatory, but how could it not be, given that everyone involved in 'crypto' -- the controversial digital currencies that exist only online -- have spent the past few years being reassured that they are the prophets of the future. They've been riding a wave of hype that has seen Bitcoin and its ilk hailed as a revolution that will transform how economies function and governments govern. In the process, some people have made a fortune from a gigantic speculative bubble. But this glitzy celebration, in one of the world's most notorious tax havens, was just a little ill-timed. Financial analysts predict a 'crypto winter' for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency rivals such as Ethereum and Solana. Sceptics have often been proved wrong -- or at least premature -- as the currencies have suffered yet another precipitous crash in value, only to recover. Now, some believe the horrendous slump in the cryptocurrency market could be the one that ends the party for good. A perfect storm of circumstances, not least a looming fall in tech stocks that many fear will turn into a historic crash, has led to predictions that we are about to see another repetition of the fate of the dotcom boom. And cryptocurrencies are slap bang in the firing line -- along with a spin-off fad for digital art, known as NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. The crypto 'bear market' (technically a prolonged fall of at least 20 per cent in share or market prices) has so far seen Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, more than halve in value since its peak in mid-November. It is now worth an estimated PS24,000. Other cryptocurrencies have experienced even worse decline, dropping as much as 80 per cent. The amount of business done by crypto exchanges, which hold the 'blockchain' ledgers that record transactions, is also dropping heavily. This has happened many times before, only for buyers to purchase the crypto coin in the expectation that its value will recover. And when they pile in, it often does bounce back. This time, however, sceptics say that trend hasn't been repeated, as speculators see less potential for making a fast buck. Rising interest rates around the world are a major part of crypto's problem. The pandemic was a golden time for cryptocurrencies, as central banks pushed interest rates down to record levels to boost economies. This low propelled investors to look for assets that provided a healthy rate of return and many inevitably targeted Bitcoin and its rivals, dubbed altcoin. Now that interest rates are rising, investors can make better returns buying global government bonds -- which are less risky than crypto. Meanwhile, rising inflation -- up to a 30-year high in the UK -- has exposed another weakness of cryptocurrency. At the pandemic's height, when fears of galloping inflation were rife, it was hailed as a hedge against it that was more effective than gold. While central banks can print as many banknotes as they like, Bitcoin is designed so that there will only be 21 million coins. There are currently about 19 million in circulation, owned by an estimated one million people. In fact, cryptocurrencies have recently been falling in value even faster than 'real' currencies such as the pound. Cryptocurrencies have also seen governments undermine another of their perceived strengths -- that the system's anonymity protected them from official interference -- by regularly finding ways of tracking crypto transactions to discover where the money is going. China has also clamped down heavily on the industry, seeing it as a threat to its sovereignty, while the vast energy output used to mine the coins continues to cast a long shadow. Some predict that the excitement surrounding cryptocurrency will wear off, laying bare its inadequacies -- both as a means of exchange that is vulnerable to fluctuations in value and so secretive that many of its users appear to be criminals. In the past, there's been a healthy supply of investors and bankers with a vested interest in maintaining the cryptocurrency excitement. Crypto speculators largely manufactured the hype over turning digital images into Bitcoin-like certificates of ownership, known as NFTs, bidding millions of dollars for pictures that anyone could copy for free. However, that sort of spending cannot last. This week, El Salvador president Nayib Bukele -- whose tiny country became the first to make Bitcoin legal tender -- unveiled plans for his cryptocurrency city, harnessing the power of a nearby volcano to mine crypto coins. The eccentric leader boasts that he wants it be a safe haven for Bitcoin investors. If so, he had better start arranging some deals with cut-price airlines: his target clientele may not be quite so flush with cash as he hopes.", "cbc85381dba40fae2b00b3736e314db7aaa8e2fed83f03f977e67029": "To report an inaccuracy, please email corrections@mailonline.co.uk.

The losses - equal to the Central American country's next bond payment - come amid a so-called 'crypto winter' and the president's plans to build a volcano-powered 'crypto city' to mine bit coin. President Nayib Bukele announced in September that El Salvador would become the first country in the world to accept Bitcoins as legal tender and forked out $105 million on the digital currency. But since then its value has fallen 45% amid a general bursting of the crypto bubble, slicing the value of the 2,301 Bitcoins bought by state coffers down to $66 million. The decision to make Bitcoin legal tender has nonplussed bond investors, who see it as exposing the state coffers to the volatility of the crypto market and thus hitting the country's ability to make bond payments. 'It's risky because it's an extremely volatile asset, and it's an investment that is totally at the discretion of the president,' Bloomberg report former El Salvador Central Bank Chief Carlos Acevedo as saying.  'He buys it on his phone when he wants to take advantage of the dip, but he doesn't do it right because when he buys there's always a bigger dip.'  El Salvador owes bondholders $382 million in interest this year, with July being the heaviest month for payments as $183 million comes due. The nation has $3.4 billion in reserves in April, according to the central bank, and there are plans to raise $1 billion through a Bitcoin-backed bond, although given the collapse of the cryptocurrency's value this is now in doubt.  Despite these reserves, markets now seriously doubt El Salvador's ability to service its debt due to its dalliance with cryptocurrency. Ratings agency Fitch downgraded El Salvador's debt to CCC, or 'junk' in the industry, worrying that increasing debt to GDP levels, expected to hit 86.9% in 2022, 'increases concerns around debt sustainability over the medium term.' Bukele has maintained his enthusiasm for the digital currency even as its price plummets, having double-downed with the purchase of another tranche of 500 bitcoins on May 9 for $15.5 million - now valued at $14.1 million just four days later. On the same day, he tweeted lavish architectural plans for a 'crypto city', a lush and green sci-fi vision of a megalopolis on the coast complete with landmarks and an airport. 'Trees everywhere,' he said on Twitter. 'With a beautiful lookout in the volcano.'  The plans for Bitcoin City put its construction - the start date of which is unclear - near the Conchagua volcano on the Gulf of Fonseca in the south-east of the Central American country. Nayib Bukele, the 40-year-old self-described 'coolest president in the world', has been developing a new form of authoritarianism that other savvy democratic leaders may soon adopt. Since the start of May he has his supporters have made the classic authoritarian moves to cement their hold over power and neuter democracy. He has fired the country's top prosecutor and the highest court, packing both institutions with loyalists. He has used state agencies to harass journalists, investigate political opponents and dismantle government checks and balances. He is also drafting a new constitution. He has explicitly stated that his mission is to ensure that his opponents never return to power. Yet he retains over 80% popular support in polling. He has seemed to achieve this by positioning himself as the antidote to El Salvador's notorious and endemic corrupt establishment - the opposition he wishes to never return to power. He has deliberately appealed to the illiberal tendencies of younger voters disillusioned with democratic politics that have produced decades of corruption.  They prefer to have an authoritarian leader who represents their interests. First proposed in 2001, it is slated to be a 'smart' city fully-based on the use of Bitcoin as the digital currency, where the citizens will be free from most taxes. 'We will have no income tax, forever. No income tax, zero property tax, no procurement tax, zero city tax, and zero CO2 emissions,' Bukele said in a statement in November.  'The only taxes that they will have in Bitcoin City is VAT, half will be used to pay the municipality's bonds and the rest for the public infrastructure and maintenance of the city.'  El Salvador has struggled with which currency to use over the years. It abandoned its own volatile fiat currency - and thus control over its own monetary policy - in favour of the US dollar in 2001. The move to Bitcoin was intended to help the citizens of the country relying on remittances from the USA and other countries avoid the notoriously predatory services that the money had to pass through.  The government developed an app called Chivo Wallet to facilitate daily crypto transactions with a $30 giveaway to citizens who downloaded it to promote its use. But only 20% of users continued to use it after spending the giveaway, with the volatility that makes crypto such an attractive unregulated security making it a poor day-to-day currency. El Salvador's travails come against the backdrop of plunging in values in digital currencies across the board in a so-called 'crypto winter' that has lost investors billions.  More than $200billion has been wiped off the cryptocurrency market yesterday alone.  During the pandemic, record low interest rates intending to boost economies led to investors buying riskier assets like cryptocurrency with higher rates of return. As skyrocketing inflation leads to a rise in interest rates in order to safeguard savings, these assets are being sold in favour of safer government bonds - which will provide better returns.", "0d2dcac4064daef9935d42c58e1c14c299d563942185b8b8ac8bcd4e": "Follow MailOnline's live coverage for all the latest updates on Rebekah Vardy vs Coleen Rooney's Wagatha Christie libel trial: Rebekah has also appeared alongside a security guard - whereas Coleen doesn't appear to have any bodyguard by her when entering court. Coleen has been joined in court by her football superstar husband Wayne as well as Hollywood's favourite lawyer David Sherborne and rising legal mind Ben Hamer. Here, FEMAIL reveals who's who at the trial that's kept the nation gripped. Ahead of the resumption of the Wagatha Christie libel trial at 10.30am today, here's a quick refresher of what we've heard so far -  - Rebekah Vardy likened Coleen Rooney to a 'pigeon that s**ts' in your hair, then broke down in tears twice yesterday; - Jamie Vardy's wife asked the High Court 'who's Davy Jones?' following a nautical reference by Coleen's barrister concerning claims that Rebekah's publicist, Caroline Watt, lost her phone containing WhatsApp message 'evidence' when it fell off a boat into the North Sea; -  PR agent Caroline Watt told Rebekah in text messages read out in court that she had leaked information about Coleen Rooney's car crash in 2019 to the media. Rebekah then allegedly tried to throw Coleen off the scent with 'disingenuous messages' to her suggesting her Instagram account might have been hacked by journalists; - The High Court heard that Rebekah told her publicist Ms Watt to use her personal Instagram account to 'monitor' Coleen's account. She denies the allegation; - Rebekah allegedly tried to use Coleen Rooney's dead sister as an excuse to get back in contact with her again after she had been 'blocked' by the WAG on Instagram; - Jamie Vardy's wife allegedly 'orchestrated' a 'staged' photo of fellow WAGs at the 2018 World Cup with the help of her publicist Caroline Watt in order to 'create attention', and allegedly christened herself the 'unofficial leader of the WAGs' in an interview. She denies the claim; - The High Court also heard how Rebekah allegedly plotted to leak information about model Danielle Lloyd's miscarriage to the media, and described Peter Andre's manhood as a 'chipolata' in a 2004 kiss-and-tell newspaper interview. Read today's coverage here. Coleen has been forced to wear a medically approved moon boot after breaking a bone in her foot. The wife of Derby County boss Wayne Rooney prompted speculation regarding the nature of her injury after she was spotted hobbling around a local supermarket in Cheshire in March. Friends have since confirmed that Coleen sustained the injury following an accident at the sprawling new build mansion she shares with Wayne and their four children. Coleen and Wayne Rooney walked through a crowd of photographers as they entered the Royal Courts of Justice for the fourth day of the Wagatha Christie libel trial. Coleen, who wore an all-white outfit, arrived in a silver Mercedes van with her husband, who donned a blue suit for the proceedings. The couple did not respond to calls from the press as they passed through the main entrance of the court building. Weeping WAG Rebekah Vardy yesterday claimed Coleen Rooney 'weaponised' her fans when she accused her of leaking stories to the Press. The 40-year-old wife of Leicester City star Jamie Vardy said she was immediately bombarded with vile abuse and death threats. She told the High Court: 'It seemed she had weaponised her fan base against me.' The mother-of-five wiped away tears as she was accused of leaking private information about Coleen, attempting to destroy incriminating evidence and pinning the blame on her agent and friend Caroline Watt. Read more here. Coleen Rooney is expected to start her evidence in the libel claim brought by Rebekah Vardy at the High Court. On the fourth day of the trial today, Rebekah is due to finish her evidence, with Coleen then taking her place in the witness box in Court 13 of the Royal Courts of Justice. Rebekah has been giving evidence for around 10 hours, at times becoming emotional on Wednesday and yesterday. The case comes after a viral social media post in October 2019, where Coleen, 36, said she had carried out a 'sting operation' and accused Rebekah, 40, of leaking 'false stories' about her private life to the press. Rebekah, who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, denies leaking stories to the media and is suing her fellow footballer's wife for libel, while Coleen is defending the claim on the basis her post was 'substantially true' and in the public interest. Wayne Rooney has been giving his wife more than just emotional support at London's High Court. Coleen's ex-England star husband has been pictured carrying a leather handbag containing a bulging file the past two days. His wife was seen carrying it on Tuesday. While his wife has been giving evidence in London's High Court, Jamie Vardy has been kicking the bladder about. During the week he scored two goals to help secure his team Leicester City's 3-0 victory over Norwich City. Meanwhile Wayne Rooney has accompanied his wife Coleen Rooney every day of the blockbuster libel trial. From Chanel and Aspinal of London to Givenchy and even Zara, Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney's war in the court room has even spilled out into the world of fashion. Yesterday Rebekah paired a white and blue vintage PS1,316 Chanel patterned dress with a PS650 tote bag from Aspinal of London, noted as one of the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite handbag designers, as well as a PS556 blazer from Veronica Beard. Coleen Rooney looked ready for business in an all-black blouse and trousers combo, which she teamed with one loafer; she has been sporting an air boot on her other foot since suffering a fracture after a fall at home in March. She opted for a PS580 blouse from French fashion brand Isabel Marant, which featured a round neck and puff sleeves. The day before, Rebekah donned for a PS1,847 Prada black dress, a PS1,245 McQueen jacket and a PS1,650 Givenchy handbag - while Coleen wore a 'down to earth' PS32.99 patterned Zara dress and Chanel shoes.  The phrase Davy Jones' Locker has long been used to describe the dreadful resting place of sailors who have died at sea and are destined to remain forever at the bottom of the sea.  The earliest known reference of the negative connotation of Davy Jones occurs in the Four Years Voyages of Capt. George Roberts, by author Daniel Defoe, published in 1726 in London.  The idiom inspired a fictional character in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series who served as the tyrannical captain of ghost ship the Flying Dutchman.  The fictional Davy Jones should not be considered with Monkees singer David Thomas Jones, who also adopted the name.    On the first day of the Wagatha Christie libel trial, the court heard how Rebekah had described Peter Andre's manhood as a 'chipolata' in a 2004 kiss-and-tell newspaper article.  Andre, 49, yesterday said that he has managed to see the funny side of the manhood reference. He took to Instagram to say that despite his positive stance, there would outrage if a man had made a similar slur about a woman's anatomy. 'I'll be laughing about it for a while, but think about how it would feel if it was the other way around, that's all I'm saying,' he said in a video. Read more about it here. One of the key players in the whole Wagatha Christie drama is Rebekah's PR agent Caroline Watt.  Ms Watt and Rebekah have been accused of plotting to leak a series of stories to the Press. Rebekah denied claims that she had conspired with Ms Watt, but admitted in London's High Court that she allowed her publicist to use her Instagram log-in to access Coleen's private account. On Tuesday, Rebekah's lawyer said she thought it was possible that Ms Watt 'was the source of some or all of the stories' after the PR agent withdrew a witness statement from the trial in which she said she had not leaked stories. Yesterday the court heard how Ms Watt had told Rebekah in a text that she had leaked information about Coleen's 2019 car crash.  The court also previously heard how Ms Watt's phone fell into the North Sea in August 2021 before further information could be extracted from it - a claim which Coleen's lawyer called 'improbable'. Rebekah Vardy asked the High Court 'who's Davy Jones?' following a nautical reference by Coleen Rooney's barrister. The High Court burst into laughter after the exchange - which concerned the claim that Rebekah's agent, Caroline Watt, lost her phone containing WhatsApp messages when it fell off a boat into the North Sea. Coleen's barrister, David Sherborne, has accused Rebekah of deleting key evidence that, it is said, would prove that Rebekah had been leaking stories to the media. 'We know that Ms Watt's phone is now in Davy Jones' Locker, don't we, Mrs Vardy?' Mr Sherborne said. Rebekah then replied: 'I'm sorry, I don't know who Davy Jones is'. The judge then had to describe the idiom, which refers to the legendary resting place of sailors who have drowned at sea. Read more here.  Twitter has taken the mick out of the sketches coming out of London's High Court this week. After users questioned why Wayne Rooney looked 'like a potato' on the first day, the illustrations have improved. Yesterday's sketches show Coleen with defined cheek bones, styled hair and statement jewellery, while sat next to husband Wayne Rooney, whose cheek bones and jawline have also been emphasised. And the image of Rebekah does not have the same white, highlighted gleam, instead showing her crying into a tissue with a forlorn look. 'Wagatha Christie' was the nickname given to Coleen after she accused Rebekah of sharing 'false' stories to The Sun newspaper. Hoping to find the Instagram account responsible for sharing these stories, Coleen said she had changed the privacy settings of her posts so it was visible to just one person's account - Rebekah's. Coleen's apparent sleuthing skills quickly led to her being nicknamed 'Wagatha Christie' - a play on the term WAG for footballers' 'wives and girlfriends' and a nod to crime writer Agatha Christie. In a tweet on October 9, 2019: 'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It's .......... Rebekah Vardy's account.' Rebekah has denied the allegations and is suing Coleen for libel. So far we've heard incredible tales of gossip, rivalry and even 'betrayal'. Here's a quick summary of the key developments -  - Rebekah Vardy likened Coleen Rooney to a 'pigeon that s**ts' in your hair, then broke down in tears twice yesterday; - Jamie Vardy's wife asked the High Court 'who's Davy Jones?' following a nautical reference by Coleen's barrister concerning claims that Rebekah's publicist, Caroline Watt, lost her phone containing WhatsApp message 'evidence' when it fell off a boat into the North Sea; -  PR agent Caroline Watt told Rebekah in text messages read out in court that she had leaked information about Coleen Rooney's car crash in 2019 to the media.

London's High Court has heard a series of astonishing and lurid claims so far - from Rebekah likening Coleen to a 'pigeon' that 's**ts in your hair', plots to leak stories about celebrities and fellow WAGs including Danielle Lloyd, and even talk of Peter Andre's 'chipolata' manhood.

'She just looked at me as if to say, are you even asking me this?' recalls Kristiina Tolkki. In a situation where most aspiring politicians would try to hide their ambition, Mrs Marin was refreshingly straightforward.  Two years ago - aged 34 - she fulfilled that ambition and became the world's youngest prime minister. Now it's her moment to step on to the world stage alongside Boris Johnson, who made a historic agreement with Finland (and Sweden) earlier this week to help defend each other if attacked by Russia. Having a much bigger - and terrifying - next-door neighbour, Finland has long pursued a policy of neutrality. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has changed everything.  Even before the conflict began, as Russian troops were massing on the Ukrainian border but the Kremlin was denying any plans to invade, Mrs Marin broke ground in her New Year's address.  Finland had the right to join Nato, and should consider it, she said. The Russian media was outraged, with critics claiming 'Moscow was stabbed in the back'. The Russian crisis has revealed a steely side to the Finnish PM who had previously attracted most attention - perhaps unfairly - for her youth, good looks and progressive social policies. Some say if the creator of Love Actually was to write the character of a 21st-century female prime minister (akin to Hugh Grant's dancing PM), he would come up with someone very like Mrs Marin.  Now leader of 5.5million people, she was raised in challenging circumstances by her mother, who had split with Mrs Marin's alcoholic father Lauri at a young age. Her mother's next partner was a woman, meaning Mrs Marin grew up in an all-female environment - or a 'rainbow household', as she herself later put it.  Plagued by financial difficulties, the family were often surviving on benefits and Mrs Marin had to work from a young age, working in a bakery and delivering magazines. And she was far from a child prodigy. Pasi Kervinen, her secondary school teacher in the small town of Pirkkala - on the outskirts of Tampere in southern Finland - told the BBC she was an 'average' student, though sometimes asked for extra homework.   In her final year of studies she met partner Markus Raikkonen, a professional footballer who she would date for the next 16 years before marrying in 2020. Graduating in 2004 at the age of 19, her grades were good enough to get her into university in Tampere - the first in her family to attend - where she studied Administrative Science. It was while studying that she had her 'political wake-up call', when she recalls as a sudden awareness that hard work could not just benefit her own life but the lives of those around her - the poor and women, in particular. Her affiliation with the Social Democrat party that she now leads began with membership in 2006, and saw her become its first vice president from 2010 to 2012. Marin's first foray into active politics actually began with defeat: A loss in the Tampere City Council elections when she was aged just 22. But at the next election, in 2012, she won - and within months had been promoted to council chairman, a position she held from 2013 until 2017. During that time she was also elected second deputy chairman of the Social Democratic Party (2014) and elected to the Finnish Parliament as an MP from the electoral district of Pirkanmaa (2015). Winning a second council election in 2017, she roe to public attention due to popular videos of her chairing council sessions which appeared on YouTube. She also won a second election to parliament in 2019, and then took on her first truly high-profile job as Minister of Transport and Communications in June that year. That role introduced Marin to the global stage, representing Finland at EU summits of other transportation ministers. It was during her first journey to Brussels, in December 2019, that the crisis erupted which would propel her to the very top of politics. Marin actually had to depart that summit early after Antti Rinne - Social Democrat leader who had been Prime Minister for just six months - summoned her home to help respond to a crisis involving a postal strike. Rinne eventually lost the confidence of his coalition partner over the crisis and was forced to step down, with Mrs Marin taking his place as the leader of a new five-party coalition led entirely by women - only one of whom was aged over 35 at the time. A politician for the Instagram generation - she has posted pictures of herself breastfeeding and pasta recipes - Mrs Marin's policies have included raising the school-leaving age to 18 and extending parental leave.  Inspired by her own upbringing, her centrepiece legislation has been an Equality Programme aimed at benefiting women and those from low-income backgrounds. The programme has so-far included policies to encourage parents to share caring responsibilities equally, crack down on domestic violence, close the gender pay gap and improve education for children from poorer backgrounds and immigrants. Her handling of the pandemic won her plaudits and a majority of public support, though some accuse her of being too dogmatic and unwilling to compromise. Somehow, amidst the turmoil of her first year in power, she found time to marry Markus - with whom she has a two-year-old daughter, Emma - in a ceremony held at her Prime Ministerial retreat on the Baltic Sea in 2020. Not long after she took over as head of Finland's coalition government she caused a sensation by posing for a 2020 magazine photoshoot in a sleek jacket - with nothing underneath. Some thought the picture eroded her credibility but #imwithsanna quickly took off online, with legions of fans praising her style. 'In every position I've ever been in, my gender has always been the starting point - that I am a young woman,' she told Vogue.  'I hope one day it won't be an issue... I'm no better and no worse than a middle-aged man.'", "cf9abd9b0cb92a97662ac2f8b305a89d78a2b7be2c8b9b6510bbbb7d": "A mother had no other choice but to give birth in her own shower after her daughter arrived two weeks early - with shocked firefighters arriving to find the pair in the bathroom. A worried neighbour had rang triple zero after hearing mother Nikki Ross in Warriewood, in Sydney's Northern Beaches, crying out in distress. Police and a NSW Fire and Rescue crew arrived at the home just after 10am on Friday and were ready to ram the front door down when nobody came to answer. Thankfully due to a quick-thinking five-year-old girl who lived in the home, she managed to use a step ladder to open the garage door for the emergency service workers who then found an exhausted Ms Ross nursing her baby in the shower. The baby girl had surprised everyone - including her father who was at work - by arriving two weeks early. Female firefighters comforted the mum while they waited for paramedics to transport her to hospital. The Warriewood mother, who was taken to nearby Northern Beaches Hospital in a stable condition along with her new daughter, said she was still trying to process her daughter's sudden arrival. 'I'm still in shock ... it was a bit crazy this morning but now all is good,' she said. '(The emergency workers) were fantastic with everything ... they were so helpful and I really appreciate what they did for me.' Firefighters also gifted one of their red helmets and a care bear to the five-year-old for her help in getting emergency workers into the townhouse.  FRNSW Leading Station Officer Tracey Spindler said the call was one she would never forget. 'I've been faced with some interesting scenarios in my 24 years as a firefighter... but this tops the lot and is this the most special without a doubt,' she said.

A smiling Coleen - dressed all in white and wearing a striking gold watch - stepped out of a black taxi alongside her husband, who wore a navy jacket over a suit and held a leather handbag containing a file.  The WAG will take to the witness box today to deliver her first day of testimony - after her bitter rival Rebekah went through a brutal cross-examination yesterday which reduced her to tears.  Rebekah broke down in court and the hearing had to be halted twice as she described the fall-out from Coleen's famous 'Wagatha Christie' tweet. It declared that she had been betrayed, adding: 'It's... Rebekah Vardy's account.' The 40-year-old wife of Leicester City star Jamie Vardy said she was immediately bombarded with vile abuse and death threats.

Rebekah sobbed: 'She's been driven to suicidal thoughts by these proceedings and the antics of the defendant [Coleen].' The footballer's wife was led from the court in tears twice during the hearing and at the end of the day as she struggled during cross-examination by Mr Sherborne. She has told how she received a 'torrent of insults' and death threats within moments of Coleen's social media post in 2019. She was seven months pregnant and feared she could lose her unborn baby. Rebekah is suing Coleen - wife of former England striker Wayne Rooney - for libel over the post, which led to her being dubbed 'Wagatha Christie'. She accused Coleen of deliberately provoking the furore, saying: 'She knows exactly how aggressive and nasty the social media community can be... She should have used her influence and reach to call the trolls off. She didn't.' In a series of tense exchanges with Mr Sherborne, Rebekah was repeatedly accused of leaking information from Coleen's private Instagram account to The Sun and of lying in her evidence to the court. Mr Sherborne asked: 'Would you not agree, Rebekah, that if it looks like a leak and it sounds like a leak - and you even use the word leak - that it's more likely than not to be a leak... That's what you are, isn't it, a leak?' 'No,' Rebekah said repeatedly, shaking her head and wiping her eyes. The lawyer claimed she had betrayed Mrs Watt, expecting her 'to do the dirty work' by contacting journalists and then attempting to pin the blame on her. He said: 'It's you that betrayed her by throwing her under the bus.' Rebekah broke down, shaking her head and muttering: 'That's a joke.' WhatsApp messages between Mrs Watt and Rebekah have been read to the court in which the two women discussed posts on Coleen's private Instagram account. Rebekah insists they were gossiping and she was joking about leaking the information, although she has admitted that Mrs Watt may have contacted journalists. Mrs Watt, 40, was expected to be called as a witness but the court has heard she is now receiving psychiatric care and has been deemed too unwell to give evidence. Experts were also unable to analyse her iPhone after she accidentally dropped it overboard while filming the Scottish coastline on a boat trip - days after the court ordered the mobile should be searched. Mr Sherborne said the episode was part of a 'catalogue of so-called unfortunate events' which had affected the case. The court heard that screenshots and videos sent on the WhatsApp chat between Rebekah and Mrs Watt were permanently deleted during a data transfer and Rebekah's laptop was discarded after it stopped working. Rebekah repeatedly denied she had deliberately deleted potentially incriminating evidence and disposed of her laptop. She said she believed the messages would have been 'extremely helpful' to proving her case. Earlier, Mr Sherborne accused her of 'selective amnesia' over her recollection of events. She denied she had orchestrated a tip-off to paparazzi over a photo of her with other England Wags - wives and girlfriends - during the World Cup in Russia in 2018. She and Mrs Watt exchanged messages in which they appeared to plan the photo, but Rebekah said it was only intended to be a picture of her. The photo led to complaints from Wags and at least one player as English football bosses wanted media coverage focused on the team and the tournament rather than the wives and girlfriends. In a message to Mrs Watt, Rebekah said: 'England will do their nut.' Asked about an article about the Wags at the World Cup, Rebekah said: 'If I'm honest, I can't remember that at all.' Mr Sherborne replied: 'Well, I would much rather you were honest because you are in a witness box under oath.' The court also heard a message she sent to Coleen in which she suggested that her phone could have been hacked. She denied it was an attempt to divert suspicion away from her. In an uncomfortable exchange, she was also asked about an article which claimed the Rooneys' marriage was over - while Coleen and Wayne sat feet away from her. Coleen, 36, is expected to start her evidence in the PS3million libel trial today. She took copious notes throughout former friend Rebekah's evidence and has reportedly signed a contract with Netflix to make a documentary about the trial. The case continues. September 2017 to October 2019 - The Sun runs a number of articles about Coleen, including that she travelled to Mexico to look into baby 'gender selection' treatment, her plan to revive her TV career and the flooding of her basement. October 9, 2019 - Coleen uses social media to accuse Rebekah of selling stories from her private Instagram account to the tabloids. Coleen says she spent five months attempting to work out who was sharing information about her and her family based on posts she had made on her personal social media page. After sharing a series of 'false' stories and using a process of elimination, Coleen claims they were viewed by one Instagram account, belonging to Rebekah. Rebekah, then pregnant with her fifth child, denies the allegations and says various people had access to her Instagram over the years. She claims to be 'so upset' by Coleen's accusation, later adding: 'I thought she was my friend but she completely annihilated me.' The public dispute makes headlines around the world, with the hashtag #WagathaChristie trending. February 13, 2020 - In a tearful appearance on ITV's Loose Women, Rebekah says the stress of the dispute caused her to have severe anxiety attacks and she 'ended up in hospital three times'. Coleen says in a statement that she does not want to 'engage in further public debate'. June 23, 2020 - It emerges that Rebekah has launched libel proceedings against Coleen. Rebekah's lawyers allege she 'suffered extreme distress, hurt, anxiety and embarrassment as a result of the publication of the post and the events which followed'. November 19-20, 2020 - The libel battle has its first High Court hearing in London. A judge rules that Coleen's October 2019 post 'clearly identified' Rebekah as being 'guilty of the serious and consistent breach of trust'. Mr Justice Warby concludes that the 'natural and ordinary' meaning of the posts was that Rebekah had 'regularly and frequently abused her status as a trusted follower of Coleen's personal Instagram account by secretly informing The Sun of Coleen's private posts and stories'. February 8-9, 2022 - A series of explosive messages between Rebekah and her agent Caroline Watt - which Coleen's lawyers allege were about her - are revealed at a preliminary court hearing. The court is told Rebekah was not referring to Coleen when she called someone a 'nasty bitch' in one exchange with Ms Watt. Coleen's lawyers seek further information from the WhatsApp messages, but the court is told that Ms Watt's phone fell into the North Sea after a boat she was on hit a wave, before further information could be extracted from it. February 14 - Coleen is refused permission to bring a High Court claim against Ms Watt for misuse of private information to be heard alongside the libel battle. A High Court judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, says the bid was brought too late and previous opportunities to make the claim had not been taken. April 13 - Ms Watt is not fit to give oral evidence at the upcoming libel trial, the High Court is told as the case returns for another hearing. The agent revokes permission for her witness statement to be used, and withdraws her waiver which would have allowed Sun journalists to say whether she was a source of the allegedly leaked stories. April 29 - Rebekah 'appears to accept' that her agent was the source of allegedly leaked stories, Coleen's barrister David Sherborne tells the High Court. He argues that a new witness statement submitted by Rebekah suggests Ms Watt was the source but Rebekah claims she 'did not authorise or condone her'. Rebekah's lawyer Hugh Tomlinson says the statement did not contain 'any change whatever in the pleaded case', with her legal team having no communication with Ms Watt. May 10 onwards - The trial begins.   Team Rooney vs Team Vardy! Rebekah is supported by crisis manager who's an expert in online reputation and a VERY burly bodyguard in Jamie's absence - while Coleen has Hollywood's favourite barrister By Bridie Pearson-Jones for MailOnline  Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy have enlisted some of the country's finest media experts and legal minds as they go head to head in the celebrity trial of the decade. Yesterday was the second instalment of the PS3million 'Wagatha Christie' libel trial between the two footballer's wives which  featured a tearful appearance in the witness box, Whatsapp 'gossip' about a mystery celebrity affair and yet more foul-mouthed text messages - all brought to an end by a fittingly dramatic fire alarm. Coleen publicly 'outed' her fellow WAG when she accused her of sharing three fake stories she had posted on her personal Instagram with The Sun as part of what she described as a social media 'sting' operation. Rebekah vehemently denied the allegation - leading her to launch the pricey legal action which saw its second day on Wednesday. While Tuesday's hearing dredged up Peter Andre's alleged 'chipolata' manhood, yesterday focused on Rebekah's relationship with her agent Caroline Watt. In the Vardy corner is Hacked Off founder Hugh Tomlinson QC - as well as two glamorous members of the legal team, including one who was once named one of the 'sexiest lawyers' in the UK, and another who is a crisis manager who's experienced in online reputation. Vardy has also appeared alongside a security guard - whereas Coleen doesn't appear to have any bodyguard by her when entering court. Meanwhile, Coleen has been joined in court by her football superstar husband Wayne as well as Hollywood's favourite lawyer  David Sherborne and rising legal mind Ben Hamer. Here, FEMAIL reveals who's who at the trial that's kept the nation gripped...  TEAM VARDY Dr Rosa Malley In Rebekah's legal team is Dr Rosa Malley, 37,  an Associate in the Dispute Resolution team at top law firm Kingsley Napley. Rosa was a part of the Hacked Off campaign and specialises in reputation and media matters, according to her online bio. She previously worked as a paralegal at top city law firm Mishcon de Reya, who led the High Court bid to stop Boris Johnson triggering Brexit. One of their barristers, Anthony Julius, acted for Princess Diana in her divorce from Prince Charles. The firm also represented Heather Mills in her divorce case against Beatles star Paul McCartney, before separating 'amicably' from their client. The company also acted for former Liberal Democrat Cabinet minister Chris Huhne when he faced allegations of perverting the course of justice by 'swapping' speeding points with his wife. Mr Huhne was later sentenced to eight months in prison. Rosa got her PhD studying the Representation of Women in British Politics at University of Bristol in 2011. She works in pre and post-publication for broadcast media, and has also worked in crisis management with politicians, sportspeople, celebrities and high profile criminal defendants.  Before her legal career, Rosa worked in politics, as a researcher at the ThinkTank Institute for Government and as a Special Projects Manager for the Hacked Off campaign.  She also taught British Politics at Birkbeck, University of London. Fittingly for the case in question, Rosa has experience in online reputation and  abuse on social media. Charlotte Harris Like Rosa, Charlotte Harris, 44, worked at Hacked Off and for eminent law firm Mishcon de Reya. Described as 'one of the most sought out privacy lawyers in the land' she boasts a client base of 'MPs, celebrities, PR experts, sports agents, sports people'. In 2013, she married  investment banker James Burr, with a very star-studded guest list including Hugh Grant, MP Tom Watson, MP Chris Huhne, and Max Clifford. At the wedding millionaire former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne enjoyed his last night of liberty before he was sentenced the next day at Southwark crown court to eight months' imprisonment.  Writing in the Diary column for the New Stateman at the time, Mr Watson said he 'entertained' the gathering of celebrities, MPs, bankers and highly remunerated senior Mishcon staff with a karaoke rendition of the new wave anthem Teenage Kicks.   Clearly beauty and brains, she was named one of the country's sexiest lawyers in 2015 in a list put together by the website Legal Cheek. Charlotte has appeared before Parliamentary Select Committees throughout her career, including the Leveson Inquiry and was described as a 'force of nature and always ready for a fight' by Chambers and Partners High Net Worth Guide in 2020. Hugh Tomlinson QC  Hugh Tomlinson QC, who is representing Ms Vardy, is a top-flight privacy silk who has launched dozen of battles with the press in his four decade career. The Leeds-born, Oxford-educated lawyer last year advocated successfully in a claim against a journalist and author after she made false allegations that Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea FC on Vladimir Putin's orders. He was one of several lawyers representing Russian oligarchs whose ethics were questioned in parliament by the Conservative MP Bob Seely following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The lawyer was on the side of Jeremy Clarkson's ex-wife Alex Hall when he tried to - but dropped - efforts to stop her claiming they had an affair during his later marriage. He also successfully represented Prince Charles as the royal sought to stop the publishing of his Hong Kong travel diaries, saying public interest justifications were 'far-fetched'. And in an earlier case, he won substantial damages for Christopher Jefferies after press coverage incorrectly associated him with the murder of his tenant Joanna Yeates in 2010. A year later he co-founded Hacked Off, the group campaigning for tighter media regulation, which he now chairs, and which has backers such as Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan. Tomlinson was born in Woodhouse in Leeds where he went to Leeds Grammar School and then Balliol College, Oxford, leaving with the top first in PPE. He then took up philosophical studies at Sussex University before going to the University of Paris in 1977. In 2000 he was a founding member of Matrix Chambers in London.  Security   Rebekah  has also been seen going into court accompanied by a burly security guard - whereas Coleen doesn't appear to have any bodyguard alongside her. She's previously discussed how security is important to her and added that she's faced threats since her feud with Coleen went public.  She told OK! magazine ahead of the 2018 World Cup that she and her family were bringing their own security to the games. Nicola McLean  Fellow WAG Nicola McLean has seemingly thrown her support behind Mrs Vardy several times - once stating that Mrs Rooney is 'not as private' as she is considered while also insisting Mrs Vardy is not interested in the fame game. Nicola is married to Tom Williams, who now plays for Hashtag United of the Essex Senior League. Tom is a defender and midfielder and made nearly 300 appearances in the Football League playing for numerous clubs, including QPR and West Ham. The I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here star, who has been married to Tom since 2009, told Closer Magazine in 2020: 'I've had different experiences at different clubs but the WAG world can be a b****y mean girls like existence... 'There can be rivalry and unfriendliness with someone in the group and the top dog and there can be a lot of drama. It isn't just amazing holidays and designer clothes there can be a lot of behind-the-scenes politics between the girls.' On some of the most famous WAGS, she went on: 'A lot of women want to emulate Victoria Beckham, Alex Gerrard, Elen Rivas - they dine out on the fact they're a WAG and it can consume you.' Nicola then pointed out that it is not all it seems with Mrs Vardy and Mrs Rooney: 'I know some WAGs will only be interested in the hierarchy, fame and drama but I don't believe Rebekah is like that. She's not fussed about the press or limelight. 'Everyone thinks Coleen is really private - but remember she's done countless interviews, books and even her own TV show.' Caroline Watt  Mrs Vardy's friend and agent, Ms Watt has featured in some of the preliminary hearings, despite not being a party to the claim or giving evidence at the trial. She is a former Virgin Atlantic air hostess who has been Rebekah's agent for the past seven years, helping to build her profile in the national media. Reports that she no longer represents her following the current controversy engulfing the two have been dismissed as inaccurate with Ms Watt remaining close to Ms Vardy both professionally and personally. Ms Watt, 39, is married to former footballer Steve Watt, who played briefly for Chelsea, making one Premier League appearance for two minutes in 2005 and Swansea City. He is currently manager of Kent non-league side Hythe Town and they have two children. After leaving the airline industry, Ms Watt began working as an agent in the world of entertainment, quickly developing a reputation for her communication skills and ability to network. She was formerly employed by talent agency The Frontrow Partnership but left in 2019 to go it alone and took her main client and close friend, Ms Vardy with her. Ms Watt has been credited with building Ms Vardy's public profile by ensuring that she regularly featured in the national media and also brokered the deal for her to appear on the hit reality TV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2018. Ms Watt started representing the high-profile WAG in 2015, when her husband, Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy shot to fame. She is a regular visitor to the Vardy's Lincolnshire home and also socialises with Ms Vardy, attending glitzy parties and bars. Her other clients include the former Page 3 girl Nicola McLean but it is Ms Vardy that has been the biggest asset in her career as an agent. TEAM ROONEY  David Sherborne   Unlike Rebekah, Coleen arrived at court with just her husband and not an entourage of lawyers. However, her legal team is just as impressive and versed in the world of celebrity as her fellow WAG's. David Sherborne, 53, who has been dubbed one of Hollywood's favourite lawyers, is acting for Mrs Rooney. He was lead counsel for victims of press intrusion in the Leveson inquiry, and represented Johnny Depp in his libel suit against The Sun. In November 2020, the High Court ruled that Depp had lost his case. In September 2020, Sherborne was dropped from the Duchess of Sussex's legal team in her case against The Mail on Sunday following an early setback. Sherborne's previous clients also include Princess Diana, Melania Trump, Sir Paul McCartney, Sienna Miller, Kate Moss and Harry Styles. His father was a QC, but while he comes from a legal family, he is seen as a 'rebel' in many ways due to his apparent fondness for the limelight. A former colleague told The Times: 'He likes to present a fun, outgoing persona and is very limelight-seeking. All the other barristers in chambers were hyper-critical of him breaking the rules.' While he's known for rubbing shoulders with A-listers, Tattler and Evening Standard both commented he is 'so handsome'  he could be a celebrity himself. The twice-married barrister was revealed to be having an affair with a member of Lord Leveson's junior counsel, Carine Patry Hoskins in 2013-. Ms Hoskins, dubbed the 'thinking man's Pippa Middleton' -was Lord Leveson's number two, while Mr Sherborne was defending Hugh Grant and other hacking  victims. Ben Hamer There was a rare moment of light relief amidst the morning's fierce cross-examination when Mr Sherborne mentioned that his junior, Ben Hamer, 29,  was 'very adept at searching online through social media on his phone.' Rebekah shot back, without smiling: 'I know, Mr Hamer follows me on Twitter' to laughter in the court. But this isn't Ben's first celebrity case. He's previously  Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard  and acted for the claimant in Blackledge v Person(s) Unknown where libel and harassment damages of PS70,000 were awarded against the Defendant.  The Durham University graduate was first called to the Bar in 2017 at Lincoln's Inn, where he was a Lord Bowen and Lord Denning scholar. Very accomplished at a young age, he's previously was presented with the Benjamin Franklin House Literary Prize for his work on free speech and fake news.  He now provides pre-publication advice to various publications such as The Times and The Sunday Times as well as HarperCollins and Bloomsbury publishers. He is security cleared to SC level. Ben began as a tenant at 5RB after successful completion of pupillage at Chambers. His supervisors were Adam Wolanski QC, Jonathan Barnes QC, Richard Munden and Adam Speker QC. Ben was called to the Bar in 2017 at Lincoln's Inn, where he was a Lord Bowen and Lord Denning scholar. In 2017, Ben was presented with the Benjamin Franklin House Literary Prize, run in conjunction with the Daily Telegraph, for his writing on free speech, social media and 'fake news'. As an undergraduate, he edited Palatinate, where he won the Hunter Davies Prize for Student Journalism. Mrs Justice Steyn The High Court judge overseeing the case, Mrs Justice Steyn (pictured right) was appointed in 2019 and sits in the Queen's Bench Division - the part of the High Court which deals with defamation, personal injury and breach of contract claims. As well as overseeing the 'Wagatha Christie' claim, other prominent cases she has heard include Arron Banks' libel claim against journalist Carole Cadwalladr and the FDA union's unsuccessful legal challenge over Boris Johnson's decision to support Priti Patel following bullying accusations. The daughter of former Law Lord Lord Steyn, Mrs Justice Steyn covered a variety of cases as a barrister, including a case over the expansion of Heathrow airport.    WAYNE ROONEY Coleen has been joined in court by supportive husband Wayne, with whom she shares four children, while Jamie Vardy is yet to be pictured in court. Wayne, who has been with Coleen since the age of 16, last played with Jamie for England in 2016. Both husbands have kept mostly quiet on the clash, however Wayne did note in his Sunday Times column before last year's European championships that he would have drafted Jamie Vardy into the England team. He added: 'Some people may be surprised at this, especially with the legal case between my wife and Jamie's wife.' The former Premier League and England striker will take to the witness stand at London's High Court where he will be questioned under oath over how much he knew about his wife's 'Wagatha Christie' investigation. A source close to the case told MailOnline: 'Wayne is 100 per cent going into the witness box and this is just going to add to the drama of the whole occasion. Hugh Tomlinson is a very experienced barrister, and this could be one of the toughest opponents Wayne has ever faced. 'Rebekah's lawyers are adamant that he should be cross examined under oath about how much he knew about what Coleen was getting up to and that the truth will emerge.' Ms Rooney has always maintained that nobody was aware of her 'sting operation' when she decided to post a number of fake Instagram stories and eventually limit who could see them to just Ms Vardy. Three of these were later published in The Sun and are at the centre of the sensational libel battle. But Ms Vardy's lawyers insist that several people could have been the source of the leaks and that Ms Rooney told Wayne and others about what she was getting up to while also sharing details of the false posts with them. In addition to giving evidence, Wayne, the former Manchester United striker who is currently manager of Derby County, is also expected to accompany his wife when she attends the High Court for the trial, which is expected to last a week. Meanwhile, when Rebekah furiously denied the allegation in a lengthy Twitter statement, her husband showed his support by liking her post.  OTHER WAGS  Mrs Rooney thanked her fans and said there 'are a lot of really good people' in the world in an Instagram story in February 2022. And along with her devoted fans, the WAG has also been publicly supported by Danielle Lloyd, who came forth with similar claims about Mrs Vardy leading to a row between the duo on social media in 2019. Mrs Lloyd made a thinly-veiled dig at Mrs Vardy after weighing in on the Mrs Rooney row during an episode of This Morning. The TV personality detailed her 'similar run-ins' with the footballer's wife, before Mrs Vardy claimed Mrs Lloyd was only upset because she didn't 'recruit' one of Jamie's footballer pals for her after her divorce from Jamie O'Hara This came amid reports that many of the WAGs had distanced themselves from Mrs Vardy at the time and were busy 'scrutinising' past conversations with her, following the fallout from her feud with Mrs Rooney. Following Mrs Lloyd's appearance on This Morning, Mrs Vardy was quick to retaliate, as she took to Twitter to claim that the TV personality's admission was 'utter b******s' and their feud was sparked by her refusal to try and find Mrs Lloyd a man following her split from Jamie [O'Hara]. She wrote: 'Danielle Lloyd making false claims on @thismorning that we have had 'similar run-ins' is utter b****cks. She is just fuming that I 'didn't get Jamie recruiting' for her like she asked me to...'

In partnership with Pulpex, who also created a paper bottle for whisky brand Johnnie Walker, the condiment company want to make all their packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. Paper bottles will not affect the taste of the ketchup, but boffins are fighting to develop the container so it won't affect the product's longevity. The bottle is made from wood pulp and would be made available alongside the current classic glass and plastic bottles. Trials are to find out if the paper version will keep the customary 'tapping' on the bottom of the bottle which gets the ketchup to dollop onto food. The company already uses 30 per cent recycled plastic and has uses recyclable caps. Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio said: 'Packaging waste is an industry-wide challenge that we must all do our part to address. 'That is why we are committed to taking steps to explore sustainable packaging solutions across our brands at Kraft Heinz, offering consumers more choices. 'This new Heinz bottle is one example of how we are applying creativity and innovation to explore new ways to provide consumers with the products they know and love while also thinking sustainably.' Heinz, whose net sales are over PS21 billion dollars, aim to have net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Scott Winston, the CEO of Pulpex, said: 'We are delighted to work with HEINZ to bring our patented packaging technology to such a famous name in food and are excited about the potential of this collaboration. 'We believe that the scope for paper-based packaging is huge, and when global household names like Heinz embrace this type of innovative technology, it's good news for everyone - consumers and the planet.' Heinz already use refill options across the UK, partnering with Tesco's Loop programme to cut down on unnecessary and oversized packaging. Last week, brand When in Rome became the latest wine company to offer a paper bottle, made from 94 per cent recycled paper. The sustainable brand developed the bottles in collaboration with the British packaging company Frugalpac.  Some drinks giants have run trials on paper bottles for spirits, including Diageo's Johnnie Walker whisky. The three wines, Pecorino IGP Terre di Chieti, Rosato and Primitivo IGP Puglia, will be launched this month priced at PS10.99 and sold on online supermarket Ocado. Founder of When in Rome, Rob Malin, said: 'We feel we're really making our mark on the industry, particularly when it comes to encouraging others to follow in our footsteps towards a more sustainable future.'", "6d892ea2c01ff29dd76c8bfb9e90c8df3e5abd200369ac230fba74f2": "A mystery woman in spectacles and and a casually-dressed man captured on security footage may hold the key to unravelling the mystery of a dead drug mule diver and a staggering 54kg of cocaine haul recovered off the Australian coast.   Detectives investigating the massive drugs haul are desperate to trace a woman with blonde highlights carrying a green bag and a man believed to be of South American descent captured on CCTV shortly after the dead diver and the huge cocaine consignment was seized at 9.30am on Monday.  The appeal for help comes after police stopped superyacht boss Jimmy Blee, 62, from leaving the country on board a flight from Cairns to Singapore on Wednesday. He is expected to be extradited from Queensland to NSW on Friday to face charges of  large scale drug smuggling. Now police have released images of the new pair they now want to quiz over the $20million drug bust. 'As investigations continue into the circumstances surrounding the death of the diver - who has yet to be formally identified - detectives believe the man and woman may be able to assist with inquiries,' said a police spokesman. 'The man is described as being of South American appearance, about 178cm tall and of an athletic build. 'The woman is described as being of a thin build, about 150-160cm tall and has a tanned complexion with blonde/grey hair.' Detective Superintendent Robert Critchlow said the pair may have been in Newcastle between May 1 and 11, and warned the man could be dangerous. He said they both entered the country illegally via ship.  Detectives launched an interstate taskforce, taking in NSW, Queensland and the Northern Territory, after the drug smuggling operation went tragically wrong on Monday.  A diver - wearing sophisticated breathing gear which disguised his movements and hid any tell-tale trail of bubbles from his scuba gear - was found dying in the water. He had been trying to recover a $20million drug haul hidden in a ship's hull and was found surrounded by large floating bricks of cocaine wrapped in yellow plastic. Police dive teams found a further 54kg of the drug in the underwater sea chest inside the hull of the Argentinean cargo ship which had arrived in Newcastle on Sunday evening. Now detectives suspect it may be linked to a similar 'spectacular' cocaine discovery found floating in the ocean off Indonesia at the weekend. Police are probing to see if there is a connection between the two after 179kg of the drug was discovered in the water near Java's Merak port on Sunday. The Indonesian haul - valued at $80million - was found in four black plastic blocks, floating in the ocean off the docks. 'This is a spectacular seizure of cocaine considering its huge value and the impact on the people as a result of the illicit drugs,' said Indonesian Navy Vice Admiral Ahmadi Heri Purwono. No-one has been arrested in connection with the discovery and local investigations are continuing, but it is understood Australian police have been in touch with their Indonesian counterparts. 'The logistics of this operation were huge with many moving parts and we're also looking at Indonesia and what may have happened there,' added Det Supt Critchlow.  NSW detectives suspect 300kg was originally stashed in the haul in the hull of the Argentinean cargo ship which docked in Newcastle. They believe 46kg was successfully removed in Australia before the tragic death of the drug mule diver, leaving 200kg still to be accounted for.", "ebd0d6e65f05f733e6a66aabaace349e65385df4a870e42486a06c90": "A British passenger has been arrested after starting a huge brawl on a Wizz Air flight to Crete, throwing punches at other travellers and even the pilot, holidaymakers said. The mass fight started shortly after the flight landed on the Greek island and saw women and men injured in the melee on Tuesday night. The passenger and his friend were badly behaved throughout the flight and his anger boiled over when he was told police would escort him to the airport, according to witnesses. Tourists said the pair were smoking and vaping throughout the journey, threatening fellow travellers, and were drunk before they even got on the plane. Stewardesses continued to serve them alcohol despite the pair claiming they had been drinking since 10am and other passengers saying they had had enough.  The pilot then emerged from his cockpit in an attempt to calm down the situation but he was then thumped, witnesses said. Police eventually dragged the blood-stained man away from the plane with his trousers around his ankles.  Dramatic footage shows screaming passengers demanding the man be taken off the flight as he wildly swings his arms. The flight departed Gatwick at 6pm and saw two men in their 30s from South London involved in the commotion. They were joined by a third man who had a litre of vodka with him on board. A woman, 37, travelling to Crete with her husband, told The Sun: 'The man and his friend had been so loud and abusive throughout the whole flight. 'But something clicked when the air stewardess told them they would be taken off the plane by police when we landed. 'It kicked off and he was just swinging punches as a group of guys tried to restrain him. 'The pilot came out and the guy hit him. He seemed okay but was understandably pretty shaken up. It was disgraceful.' Some passengers escaped through the rear exit but then had to wait two hours at security while they gave police statements, meaning many missed their transfers. A scheduled return flight to the UK had to be cancelled while blood was cleared up. Stranded Britons had to wait another 24 hours for the next flight home.

Putin's troops were trying to rescue men and vehicles that had got stranded on the wrong side of the Donets River, near Biolhorivka, after the first attempt on May 8 ended with their pontoon bridges being sunk by an artillery barrage that destroyed dozens of armoured vehicles and may have killed more than 1,000 troops. But their rescue mission was found out and subjected to the same fate. Fresh satellite images taken near Biolhorivka show yet another sunken pontoon bridge along with half a dozen destroyed or abandoned vehicles.  Russia has lost more than 70 vehicles and seen two infantry battalions mangled in four days of attempts to bridge the river, according to Ukrainian investigative site InformNapalm. It is just the latest humiliation for Putin's army - once ranked second in the world - after commanders failed to capture the capital Kyiv, were beaten back from Mykolaiv by a rag-tag band of territorial defence troops and civilians, and got their Black Sea flagship Moskva sunk by Ukrainian missiles. Commanders are now trying to seize control of the Donbas region - cynically claiming that was their true objective all along - but have so-far failed to make any significant breakthrough in almost a month of fighting, with Kyiv claiming Russia has suffered 'colossal' losses. The attack on Bilohorivka was almost certainly designed to surround the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk - which straddle the Donets River - in a pincer movement from west and east. Had it succeeded, Ukrainian defenders would have been cut off from reinforcement and re-supply, facing a similar fate to those in Mariupol. Having failed to take Bilohorivka, Russian forces now pushing into the outskirts of Severodonetsk face street-to-street fighting in order to take it. Seizing Lysychansk will require them to make a river crossing somewhere, after Ukrainian defenders destroyed permanent bridges. It remains to be seen whether they are capable of doing so. If Russia can seize the two cities, it would allow them to claim the Luhansk region has been 'liberated' from Ukrainian control - providing a propaganda boost to the Kremlin months after Putin declared it to be independent and vowed to 'defend' it against what he claimed was Ukrainian aggression. His commanders would then face a bitter fight to take Sloyansk and Kramatorsk - some 40 miles to the west - using the same surround-and-capture tactics. Coupled with the fall of Mariupol, where hundreds of Ukrainian troops are staging a last stand inside a steel works, it would allow Putin to claim victory in Donbas. Provided he has enough men left to defend against Ukrainian counter-attacks, that could prompt a declaration of overall victory for his 'special military operation' and may see a halt in the fighting while some kind of peace deal is hashed out between the two sides. Alternatively, the 'victory' could prompt Putin to push further - perhaps renewing attacks along the Black Sea coast towards Mykolaiv and Odesa, leaving what remains of the country landlocked and deprived of lucrative oceangoing trading routes. But such an outcome is far from certain, and Kyiv is likely to be extremely mistrustful of any ceasefire agreement - fearing it will only give Russia time to rearm and renew its attack, as happened between the last invasion in 2014 and the current war which began on February 24. At the very least, the country is sure to demand security guarantees from the West to protect it from being victimised a third time - or will simply refuse to sign and keep trying to break Russian lines using weapons supplied by the West. In the event that Russia cannot take the Donbas, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said this week that Ukraine's 'victory' aim would be to reverse the tide of the war and push Russia back - not just to the areas it held before the invasion but entirely out of Ukrainian territory. That would mean re-taking areas of Donetsk and Luhansk held before the current invasion, and an assault on Russian naval bases in Crimea. It remains to be seen whether Ukraine has the manpower for such attacks. Russia faced mounting accusations of war crimes in Ukraine Friday including forcing thousands of people into interrogation camps, as the number of refugees reported to have fled the conflict surpassed six million. The Russian invasion has also led to a seismic policy change by Finland, whose leaders said Thursday the previously neutral nation must apply to join NATO 'without delay' - triggering a blunt warning of retaliation from the Kremlin. Throughout the 11-week conflict, Russian forces have been accused of committing atrocities - including the killing of unarmed civilians, torture and rape. CNN and the BBC on Thursday released what they said was security camera footage showing Russian soldiers with assault rifles shooting two Ukrainian civilians in the back. The two men appeared unarmed - the footage showed the soldiers frisking them before allowing them to walk away at a business premises on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv. One man died on the spot, the other shortly after, according to the outlets. The killings took place on March 16 and are being investigated as a war crime, CNN said.  Separately, investigators and witnesses interviewed by AFP Thursday accused Russian forces of shelling a residential home in an eastern Ukrainian village from a tank, killing three civilians. The incident took place on March 27 in the village of Stepanki outside Kharkiv, the Ukrainian prosecutor general's office said on Telegram. Local resident Denys, 40, said he saw the barrel of the tank turn towards him. 'Someone said: let's go hide inside the house,' Denys said. 'I entered last and as soon as I entered, the tank fired. Everything collapsed, I couldn't see anything.' The UN Human Rights Council voted 33-2 on Thursday to investigate alleged atrocities by Russian troops in Ukraine. Ukrainian prosecutors say they have received reports of more than 10,000 alleged crimes. The UN refugee agency said Thursday more than six million people had fled Ukraine, more than half of them going to neighbouring Poland. Women and children make up 90 per cent of the refugees, UNHCR said. The United States on Thursday accused Russia of forcibly taking tens of thousands of Ukrainians to 'filtration camps' in Russia or Russian-controlled territory where they are subjected to 'brutal interrogations'. 'These actions amount to war crimes,' said Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). 'We must not allow this evil to stand.' The remarks backed Kyiv's allegation that 1.2 million people have been taken to Russia or Russian-controlled areas. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that Russian forces had destroyed 570 healthcare facilities. 'What for? It's nonsense. It's barbarity,' he said. In the northeastern region of Chernihiv, three people were killed and 12 others wounded early Thursday in a strike on a school in Novgorod-Siversky, the emergency services said. In the southern port city of Mariupol, troops at the Azovstal steelworks have been holding out against Russian bombardment for weeks, refusing demands to surrender. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 'difficult talks' were under way on the evacuation of 38 seriously wounded soldiers. Russia's army said it struck Donetsk and Kharkiv on Thursday, killing more than 170 people and destroying Ukrainian drones and rockets. When launching the invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin had cited in part what he called the threat from NATO, which has expanded eastwards since the end of the Cold War. Rather than containing the bloc, however, the war appears to have had the opposite effect. The leaders of Finland, a declared neutral state in East-West crises for decades, said Thursday their country should join the bloc. 'As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance,' President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said in a joint statement. The Russian foreign ministry warned Moscow would be 'forced to take reciprocal steps, military-technical and other, to address the resulting threats'. Finland shares a 1,300-kilometre (800-mile) border with Russia and its past is studded with conflict with its giant neighbour. NATO has already declared it will warmly embrace Finland and Sweden, two countries with deep pockets and well-equipped militaries. A special committee will announce Finland's formal decision on Sunday. Sweden, another neutral state, is widely expected to follow. The flow of gas from Russia to Europe meanwhile fell, spurring fears for Germany and other economies heavily dependent on that source of energy. Russian energy giant Gazprom announced it would stop supplying gas via the Polish part of the Yamal-Europe pipeline following retaliatory sanctions that Moscow imposed Wednesday on Western companies. Gazprom also said gas transiting to Europe via Ukraine had dropped by a third. Ukraine and Poland are major supply routes for Russian gas to Europe and the two sides have kept flows going despite the conflict. Europe must end its reliance on Russian gas and cut off Moscow's 'energy oxygen', Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Thursday. Kuleba has been invited to the meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Germany, which started Thursday with the Ukraine war set to be the main topic on the agenda.", "d72996b125289d222a93695daa77c91a110335b6e340ab7b2a2e0993": "Boris Johnson's plan to brutally cull a fifth of Civil Service jobs will work because Brexit is done and extra staff brought in during the aftermath are no longer required, a senior minister claimed today. Jacob Rees-Mogg said the PM's decision to axe 91,000 posts within three years would simply take Whitehall numbers back to their pre 2016 levels, after they were swollen by the EU departure and Covid. The Brexit Opportunities Minister spoke out as unions reacted with fury to the proposal to use public sector job cuts to save PS3.5billion and give ministers leeway to bring in tax cuts for millions of UK families struggling with the cost of living.    The Prime Minister used a 'cost of living' Cabinet meeting in the Midlands yesterday to order his top team to redouble their efforts to ease the financial pressure on struggling families. He claimed the Civil service had become 'swollen' during the pandemic. Ministers were given one month to come up with plans to cut the size of the Civil Service by 91,000 - almost a fifth of the current total. The changes will come in over the next three years.  Mr Rees-Mogg used a media round of interviews to defend the move and vow to move even faster within his own Cabinet Office department He told Sky News: 'I know it sounds eye-catching but it's just getting back to the civil service we had in 2016... since then we've had to take on people for specific tasks.  'So dealing with the aftermath of Brexit and dealing with Covid, so there's been a reason for that increase, but we're now trying to get back to normal.'   Mr Johnson last night told the Daily Mail: 'We have got to cut the cost of government to reduce the cost of living.'  And he suggested the billions saved could be ploughed into tax cuts, saying: 'Every pound the Government pre-empts from the taxpayer is money they can spend on their own priorities, on their own lives.' Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union for civil and public service workers, accused the Government of 'picking a number out of the air'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that part of civil servants' jobs was to look at efficiency.  'They've already committed to 5 per cent cuts in their budgets as part of the spending review,' he said.  'That kind of ongoing efficiency is what the civil service does all the time. But if you're going to just simply pluck a figure out of the air and say it's now 90,000 because there's a convenient point in time where we liked the number, that's not a serious way to look at what does a government want to do and how can it deliver that in the most effective and efficient way.'      The PM's chief of staff, Steve Barclay, is also investigating plans to use new technology, including artificial intelligence systems, to improve efficiency at struggling agencies such as the Passport Office and DVLA. Mr Johnson said the public 'deserve better' from organisations which have allowed huge backlogs to build up.  And he remains convinced of the need to get more officials back at their desks, adding: 'We need to get back into the habit of getting into the office, getting into the workplace. 'There will be lots of people who disagree with me, but I believe people are more productive, more energetic, more full of ideas, when they are surrounded by other people.' But the PM said technology also had a major role to play in improving efficiency - and potentially cutting the cost of official documents such as passports. 'I'm not antediluvian about technology,' he said.  'Things like Zoom and Teams can increase productivity, rather than just be an excuse for people to stay at home. 'We should be asking ourselves, why does it cost so much for a passport? Often it's because the cost has been jacked up over the years to support the cost of the organisation providing them.  'What is the chief driver of those costs? Headcount. If we can do more with AI... potentially it could be cheaper.' The move will put ministers on a collision course with the powerful Civil Service unions, which are already complaining bitterly about a Government drive to persuade thousands of staff to return to their desks after the pandemic. There were fresh calls yesterday for Rishi Sunak to cut taxes after official figures showed that the economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1 per cent in March - even before the latest round of energy price hikes last month. NatWest chairman Sir Howard Davies urged ministers to focus on helping the worst-off households, pointing out that the poorest fifth of the population will have to cut their non-essential spending by 20 per cent. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson followed Chancellor Mr Sunak in saying he would look at introducing a windfall tax on the profits of energy giants to help struggling families. BP sought to head off pressure for such a levy by announcing it would reinvest all its profits from North Sea oil and gas over the next decade back into the UK. The PM's plan to reduce civil servant numbers comes at a time when ministers are grappling with the so-called Whitehall 'Blob' over a range of issues, including Brexit. A Government source said the Civil Service had become bloated during the pandemic and needed to be cut down. The source said it was right that the Government makes renewed efforts to tighten its belt in the same way that businesses and families are doing. 'All businesses are looking at ways they can reduce their costs and increase performance and government should be no different,' the source said.  'We have seen the Civil Service headcount rise by 90,000 since 2016. A lot of that was pandemic-related and it was the right thing to do at the time. 'But we are past the pandemic now and we cannot let this bigger state become the new normal - we need to get back to pre-pandemic levels. 'It will help save a substantial amount of money, freeing up resources that could be used to help people with the cost of living.' The current Civil Service headcount stands at 475,000, the highest level since 2010. Ministers have been given two years to reduce that total by 91,000.  Downing Street declined to put a figure on the estimated savings, but the average civil servant earns PS28,100, with other costs such as National Insurance and pensions adding around PS10,000 to the wage bill. Based on these figures, cutting 91,000 jobs would save about PS3.5 billion a year. Government sources said ministers would focus initially on reducing numbers through 'natural wastage', such as recruitment freezes.  But Jacob Rees-Mogg warned the Cabinet yesterday that compulsory redundancies may be needed. He said the cuts would restore the Civil Service to the size it was a decade ago, adding: 'It has been done before and it can be done again.' Mr Rees-Mogg, the minister for government efficiency, outlined the plans to the Cabinet yesterday when ministers gathered in Stoke-on-Trent to discuss ways to accelerate action on tackling the cost of living. He said that on current projections the Civil Service was due to expand over the next three years, 'despite the requirements of Brexit and the pandemic now receding'. Ministers were told that 30,000 to 40,000 civil servants leave every year, meaning major reductions could be achieved through recruitment freezes.

Exam regulator Ofqual has said exams should use clearer language, a clear and consistent layout and 'source material, context, images and colour in ways that do not disadvantage students'. English exams may 'test the use of complex sentence structures, or analogy, inference and allusion', but the watchdog has said maths exams testing numeracy skills 'should not contain overly complex text'. It comes after Ofqual launched a consultation on accessibility in exams in November last year. At the time, the regulator said pupils may be 'unfairly disadvantaged by irrelevant features' that could stop them showing their full potential in a subject. There was also concern expressed over exams having a middle-class bias, with modern languages or maths exams asking questions about the theatre and skiing holidays. In 2017, an Edexcel GCSE maths paper asked students about a theatre where 'each person had a seat in the circle or had a seat in the stalls'. The question asked pupils to calculate how many of the 2,600 theatre seats were occupied, but pupils would have needed to understand that the circle and stalls are different areas of the theatre to answer correctly. An International GCSE maths paper, also from Edexcel, last year asked students to calculate percentage increases in house prices.  And a 2019 German GCSE examiners' report from exam board AQA said 'some students struggled to state advantages and/or disadvantages of a skiing holiday'. At the time, a spokesperson for AQA said the exam had questions covering 'lots of different topics'. They added: 'To suggest one question out of five questions on one task creates a cultural bias across an entire exam is false and misleading.' But a report published by the National Association of Language Advisers in 2020 found that pupils who had to 'make up' answers to language questions where they could not draw on their own direct experience were put at a disadvantage. It also found that some candidates found tasks 'unrealistic or irrelevant'. One teacher said in the report: 'I have bright capable students who struggle with answering many of the questions and I am constantly telling them that their answers don't have to be true and they can just 'make it up'. 'Unfortunately, however, this makes their learning less meaningful as they are talking about things that are not relevant to them or even true so their willingness and motivation drops.' The report said topics concerning the topics of family and friends, house and home, holidays, leisure activities, charity and volunteering, lifestyle, social issues and work were seen as the most difficult for poorer pupils. Ofqual chief regulator Jo Saxton today said it is 'crucial' for exams in all subjects to be 'accessible to give all students a fair opportunity to demonstrate what they know and can do, and to achieve results which reflect this'. She added that exams 'must remain rigorous', but also should not 'unfairly disadvantage any student because of poor design or presentation'. Dr Saxtion continued: 'This isn't about making exams and assessments easier, but about breaking down the barriers that stop young people achieving their true potential and making sure that exams actually test the things they are designed to test. 'If an exam is intended to assess understanding of complex language, then of course the questions will use complex language.  'But if an exam is assessing numerical skills, it does not need to include complex language which could get in the way of some students showing those skills.' This is of particular importance for pupils who have special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), she added. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said exam questions should not rely on pupils' 'cultural capital, nor should they be overly wordy, but should test the knowledge or skill that is being assessed'. Charities supporting people with disabilities have also welcomed the new guidance. Caireen Sutherland, head of education at the Royal National Institute of Blind People, said it is very important for exams to be accessible 'if all children and young people with vision impairment are to achieve their full potential'. And a spokesperson for the Autism Education Trust described the move as a 'positive step towards creating a more inclusive education system' - recognising that adjustments need to be made to help autistic pupils reach their potential. They added: 'This new guidance will also support students from other countries for whom English is an additional language.' A Pearson spokesperson said: 'We welcome today's Ofqual guidance on accessibility in assessment. Since our own internal review in 2017/18 we've worked with teachers, parents and students to make the language in our exam papers more accessible and ensure that any contexts used are simple, representative and age appropriate.  'We have processes in place, working with practicing teachers and language specialists, to check that scenarios used have no barriers for students.  'Our question papers are also reviewed to ensure they reflect our diversity, equity and inclusion principles.' It comes two days after Ofqual confirmed  that GCSE and A-Level exams will return to pre-Covid rules from next year.

Staff Sgt. Seth Michael Plant, 30, was killed by a brown mother bear protecting her cubs outside Air Force base Elmendorf-Richardson, Anchorage. Commander Lt. Col. David J. Nelson said: '[Plant] always had a smile on his face, he always went above and beyond what was asked of him, and he served as an inspiration to all who had the privilege to know him.' Plant was from Saint Augustine, Florida and had been at Elmendorf-Richardson since July 2021, the Army said.  He was an infantryman from the 3rd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment.  Plant and two other soldiers were out training when they came upon the bear den. The mother bear crawled outside in defence of her cubs before pouncing. All Plant and his fellow troopers saw was a 'flash of brown mass', an Army captain said. Alaska Wildlife Troopers commander Capt. Derek DeGraaf told the New York Times: 'From the soldier's perspective, there was a flash of brown mass. 'They were attacked and didn't even see it coming.' The Alaska Department of Fish and Game said a den with two brown bear cubs was found nearby.  They said a brown bear later approached the area and officials who responded to the attack used bear spray, an irritant that can deter bears.  The bear left and hasn't been spotted since, the department said. Hair collected during an initial investigation into the attack was consistent with a brown bear, they added. The bear attack took place in a remote section of the military base, the department said.  Cyndi Wardlow, a regional supervisor with the department, said information gathered so far suggests this was a 'defensive attack by a female bear protecting her cubs'. 'We are trying to learn everything we can about what happened to increase public safety around wildlife in Alaska,' she told AP. The department said it will kill bears that are considered public safety threats or are involved in deadly attacks. It added that game cameras placed during its investigation indicated that an adult bear had returned to the area and left the den site with the cubs. The area has since been closed to the public for all recreation activity to prevent further attacks.", "93877541883836887bf0a7307f242f72abcffc2dab10a58297469f55": "Elon Musk has blasted America's poor work ethic and praised toiling Chinese staff who stay at the factory 'burning the 3am oil'. The Tesla CEO, who once slept on his Fremont factory floor during production of the company's Model 3 car, said Americans are 'trying to avoid going to work at all' compared to their Chinese counterparts. Speaking in an interview with the Financial Times, he said: 'I think there will be some very strong companies coming out of China.  'There's just a lot of super talented and hardworking people in China that strongly believe in manufacturing.  'And they won't just be burning the midnight oil. They'll be burning the 3am oil. So they won't even leave the factory type of thing.  'Whereas in America, people are trying to avoid going to work at all.' Last month, staff at Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory were made to sleep at work when production resumed after a three-week shutdown, according to Bloomberg.  The factory started operating as a 'closed-loop system to avoid further shutdowns caused by China's draconian Zero Covid policy.  Workers were given a sleeping bag and mattress and a part of the factory floor to sleep on. Food of around $63 a day was provided to each employee but they were expected to work 12 hours a day, with one day off every six days. Before the temporary measures were imposed, staff reportedly worked eight-hour shifts with four days on and two days off.  Before Shanghai's lockdown on March 28, the Gigafactory produced 2,000 cars a day and made half of the vehicles the company delivered worldwide last year.  Last year, the world's richest man, said he sleeps only six hours each night while juggling his portfolio of multi-billion dollar businesses. 'I work a lot,' Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan. 'Normally, I'll be in meetings at work until 1 or 2 in the morning. Saturday [and] Sunday, usually not, but sometimes. 'I tried sleeping less, but then total productivity decreases,' he said.  'I don't find myself wanting more sleep than six [hours].'  Musk has developed a reputation as a workaholic. In 2018, Tesla employees told Business Insider that they would frequently see their boss asleep while curled under tables, desks, and even on the factory floor. 'He's here all the time,' Miguel Carrera, a manufacturing tech lead, told Business Insider. 'I know people have seen him sleeping on the floor under a desk. 'All of a sudden, everybody's all walking out and you look around and someone is curled up under the desk, come to find out it's Elon.' In November 2018, he told the Recode Decode podcast that during Tesla's efforts to ramp up production of its Model 3 sedan, he found himself constantly working. 'There were times when, some weeks ... I haven't counted exactly, but I would just sort of sleep for a few hours, work, sleep for a few hours, work, seven days a week,' he said. 'Some of those [weeks] must have been 120 hours or something nutty.' Musk acknowledged that his crazy work schedule had 'burnt out a bunch of neurons.' In 2018, he told Axios: 'No one should put this many hours into your work. '[It's] not recommended for anyone. You're gonna go a little bonkers if you work 120 hours a week.' Yesterday, it was revealed that Musk's purchase of the largest individually-held stake in Twitter is being investigated by U.S. regulators after he delayed reporting the buy - and thus failed to provide sufficient warning that a takeover bid was looming. The investigation, currently in its early stages, could provoke a firestorm between the mercurial entrepreneur and the financial regulators, just as Musk is trying to wrap up his purchase of Twitter, approved on April 26. It also comes amid frenzied speculation about what the world's richest man will do to Twitter once he takes the reins.  He said this week he would allow Donald Trump back on Twitter, in line with his previous declarations that he planned to err on the side of free speech rather than bans and censorship. On Wednesday, Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and former CEO, also denied recent speculation that he had been brought back to head the Musk-owned company. With the deal to take Twitter private expected to take two to three months to finalize, speculation is mounting as to what Musk will do. The 50-year-old's first move towards buying Twitter was his purchase of a 9.2 percent stake in the tech company in mid February. But he did not disclose his purchase to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) until at least 10 days later, on April 4. Any investor who crosses a 5 percent stake must file a form with the SEC within 10 days. It serves as an early sign to stakeholders that a big investor could seek to control the company. Musk's April 4 filing also characterized his stake as passive, meaning he did not plan to take over Twitter or influence its management or business. The next day, however, he was offered a position on Twitter's board, and a couple of weeks later, the world's richest man had clinched a $44billion deal to buy the social media giant. The SEC investigation was first reported on Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal. Musk, known for his candid Twitter posts, has a long history of skirmishes with the SEC. Most recently, a U.S. judge slammed him for trying to escape a settlement with the SEC requiring oversight of his Tesla tweets. In April, the Information reported that the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Musk violated a law that requires companies and people to report certain large transactions to antitrust-enforcement agencies. Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November, replaced by Parag Agrawal, has been broadly supportive of Musk's moves and has been consulting with him over the direction of the company - most recently, confirming that he and Musk discussed reinstating Trump, and agreed it was the right thing to do.", "4406bf00de58ed57bfee00d916e99fd59bffaf930e21213786d98be3": "A typically arid outback town in Central West Queensland was drastically transformed into a murky brown swamp after being lashed by days of torrential rain.  Incredible photos show the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum, located on an 1800 hectare mesa plateau near Winton, submerged underwater after recording 160mm since April 23.  Nestled in the Mitchell Grass Downs, the savanna area - 1200km northwest of Brisbane - features rolling red earth plains, with patches of spinifex and vibrant green gums.  But the plains have turned into an apocalyptic-looking lake after the state was battered by downpours, with the Dinosaur Stampede feature copping a whopping 200mm.  Birds-eye view images taken by museum employee Trish Sloan shows kilometres of water, dyed sepia from the dirt. Ms Sloan said there has been no reported damage to the museum itself so far, but the wild conditions have blocked off access to the site.  'We just can't get to it,' she told 9News.  Ms Sloan said it was 'unreal' to see so much water in the dry region.  Although unusual, the sight is not unprecedented - with the usually drought-stricken area being hit by two other major flooding events in recent years.  In March 2018, the rural town - which sits 900km west of Rockhampton - was turned into an inland island after being smashed by 232mm of rain within a week.  The downpours far exceeded the usual March rainfall of 53.8mm and cut off roads and led to residents being evacuated.  Two years earlier a similar drenching saw major highways closed and the town surrounded by water after more than 100mm of rain fell in less than 24 hours.  At the time, the March 2016 weather event broke records, marking the wettest day for Winton since the year 2000.

Queensland police released bodyworn vision on Friday showing officers rescuing the pet-owners, after their van was swept off the road by floodwaters at Morwincha, 90km south-west of Brisbane yesterday. The frightening video was captured just after 4pm on Thursday after police had attended the scene of a fatal traffic crash on the Cunningham Highway. But the officers from Ipswich District then received an urgent call for help, several hundred metres away, where they found the men's van had been washed off the flooded bridge and was wedged against a tree. One man could be seen clinging to the passenger door while another elderly man was trapped inside with three dogs as floodwater rose rapidly around them. Police waded more than 100 metres out and retrieved the first man and a puppy. The officer then returned to the vehicle and carried the elderly male on his back through the flood waters to higher ground. The remaining officers coaxed the dogs, a kelpie and a Great Dane, out of the submerged van and carried them out. One of the officers involved in the rescue is currently caring for the dogs, Ghost, Molly and the puppy (yet to be named), until conditions ease in the Scenic Rim area. Police again urged the public to avoid roads, creeks and bridges likely to be impacted by rapidly rising water, storm debris and flood damage during the current wet weather.

Major flood warnings also remain in place for the Cape, Condamine, Balonne, Logan and Macintyre rivers, and the Bureau says flash-flooding is possible in many areas. The town of Laidley in the Lockyer Valley has been particularly impacted, with the main street of the historic town resembling a river on Friday morning. A Queensland town is underwater with a massive swathe of the state is set to get smashed by yet another heavy rainfall event spurred by a massive low-pressure system. The main street of Laidley - a historic valley town just off the highway between Brisbane and Toowoomba - was so consumed by floodwater on Friday morning it more resembled a river.  Residents of the Lockyer Valley area fled low-lying homes overnight after being woken up by a flood siren, door knocks, and instructions to evacuate, following days of heavy rain.

Officers raided the premises and were pictured taking away bags of evidence including computers on Tuesday. Three people including two men aged 32 and 61 have been arrested after Ofsted inspectors found a locked room with a bed and medical equipment at the unregistered school. One of those arrested is said to be from east London, sparking concerns of FGM being carried out further afield.  The exact number of women and girls in the UK who have undergone FGM is unknown. However, a 2015 study based on 2011 census data estimated that around 60,000 girls aged 0-14 were born in England and Wales to mothers who had undergone FGM.  It is thought to be the first alleged case of FGM in Britain involving an unregistered school. A West Midlands Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'We were called at 11.39am on Tuesday 10 May by Ofsted inspectors who were investigating reports of an unregistered school. 'There were concerns raised about possible illegal practices which may have taken place at the premises.  'As part of our enquiries two men, aged 32 and 61, have been arrested on suspicion of being involved in female genital mutilation and remain in custody for questioning. 'We understand the concern this will cause within the community but it's important to stress we're still working to establish whether any offences have occurred. Our investigation along with partner agencies is continuing.' MailOnline has contacted Ofsted for further information.  An unregistered school is a setting that is operating as an independent school but is not registered with the Department for Education. Anyone who wishes to run an independent or private school must register as a school with the Department for Education, the regulatory body for independent schools. If a school is not operating legally, the person who runs it is guilty of an offence under section 96 of the Education and Skills Act 2008.  If convicted, they could be fined an unlimited amount and/or imprisoned for up to six months. A 2015 study based on 2011 census data on FGM in the UK found around 103,000 women aged 15-49 and around 24,000 women aged 50 and over who have migrated to England and Wales are living with the consequences of FGM. It also found that around 10,000 girls aged under 15 who have migrated to England and Wales are likely to have undergone FGM The study also reported that women who have undergone FGM do not only live in urban centres in England and Wales. London has the highest prevalence rate in England and Wales, with an estimated 2.1% of women affected by FGM, the 2015 study found. Outside the capital, the highest estimates were for Manchester, Slough, Bristol, Leicester and Birmingham.", "305033b97221fbfcfa8427294f2ef4957398bb96fc04c8ac21615d24": "Hundreds of annoyed travellers at Manchester airport were forced to queue on the travelator to get through security as early as 4am today. Britain's airport nightmare rages on, with photos and videos posted to Twitter this morning showing holidaymakers snaking through the terminal building - and one flyer warning he could miss his flight to Corfu after queueing for a 'quarter mile'. Other travellers shared images of packed queues at Birmingham and Leeds Bradford, the latter the latest airport to be engulfed in chaos. Email jack.wright@mailonline.co.uk  Airport bosses are blaming an industry-wide problem with staffing shortages caused by Covid self-isolation and mass layoffs during the pandemic. Tweeting from Manchester, one person raged: 'Manchester airport is an absolute shambles! 3 and a half hours early for a flight and we just about make it #disgrace #manchesterairport'. Another said: 'Oh dear, flying to Corfu at 06:10, it's 04:25 and we are, literally, 1/4 of a mile away in a queue for the check-in desk.... I'll let you know.' A third posted on Twitter: '#manchesterairport #easyJet the queue at 3.00am this morning! What is the point in telling people to turn up 3 hours before their flight and then have no one on Check-In?? People already queuing out of the door - madness!!' MailOnline has contacted Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds Bradford airports for comment.  Yesterday holidaymakers at Leeds Bradford said they stood for more than three hours to get through security, with some feeling faint or bursting into tears as their flight times neared. One traveller claimed there was just one staff member checking the passports of around 3,000 people - with some waiting outside the terminal. He raged: 'The airport aren't interested. Get there early they say, but you're still going to queue for three hours.'  Two police officers were seen monitoring the 'standstill' queues during yesterday's chaos, Leeds Live reported. Another holidaymaker said she missed her flight to Fuerteventura despite arriving at Leeds Bradford three hours before take-off, adding: 'There was total chaos. After having no customer services available it was clear the whole of the airport was a queue'. Email jack.wright@mailonline.co.uk  She told the BBC: 'There were families crying, there were people feeling faint. I was in disbelief.' On Twitter, one person warned: 'For anyone coming to #leedsbradfordairport it really is as bad as people are saying. 3 hours at least this morning for security'. Another said: 'Huge queues at #leedsbradfordairport for security, Get there early even for fast track.'  One passenger told Leeds Live: 'I've been to this airport many times before and never seen queues quite like it - it really is as busy as everyone has been saying. Not the most thrilling thing to have to do on the way to a much-anticipated holiday.'  A spokesperson for Leeds Bradford Airport told MailOnline yesterday: 'We would like to apologise to passengers impacted by queues at LBA.  'We're working hard to overcome these challenges, that are impacting airports across the country, through recruitment and training initiatives, while managing queues safely.' Tweeting from Birmingham yesterday, one person claimed: 'Unbelievable. We followed your advice and got here just 2 hours before and were now queueing with hundreds of others in a security line which is taking forever - not impressed at all #whatawaytostartaholiday'. Another said: 'This is the worst I've ever seen at an airport. Unbelievable queues today. 400m long'. Later, he added: 'Scrap that. Queue is about 1 mile long - literally'.  One Twitter user posted: '@bhx_official the queue this morning is a disgrace. Why after days of this have you not sorted it!!!??? #birminghamairport'.  Heathrow bosses revealed some 7.5 million more travellers than expected are set to fly this year, sparking fears of further disruption at the terminals.  The west London airport said it was increasing its passenger number forecast for 2022 from 45.5 million to nearly 53 million. This 16% rise follows a 'strong' April, with 5.1 million people using the travel hub. Heathrow said outbound leisure travellers and people cashing in airline vouchers obtained for trips cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic are driving the recovery in demand, which it expects to last throughout the summer. The forecast means Heathrow expects passenger numbers to reach 65% of pre-pandemic levels this year - a 'realistic assessment', the airport insisted. A Birmingham Airport spokesperson told MailOnline yesterday: 'Queues were long but managed and moving this morning as we helped many of the more than 14,000 customers booked to fly out of BHX today. 'As always, we ask customers to arrive at the airport at the time your airline advises - and to help us help you keep queues moving by removing any liquids, gels, pastes and electrical items from your bags before our security x-ray scanners.' On Tuesday there were also delays for holidaymakers in Bristol, while in Manchester, one passenger told of waiting 40 minutes for the airbridge to get off the plane. Elsewhere, there were also questions over baggage, as another traveller reported losing their wallet in the chaos. One flyer tweeted: 'The queues at Birmingham Airport are worse than the media are reporting! Give yourself at least 5hrs before your flight!' Another traveller wrote: 'OMG queues for security are ridiculous!!! Anyone flying from here at the moment I'd suggest turning up at least 4hrs before your flight is due to depart.' A third said: 'Yet another ridiculously poor experience at BHX this AM. Security queue both upstairs and downstairs. Time for the management team to resign.' Airports up and down the UK continue to face staffing issues in the wake of Covid restrictions. Travel chiefs say the issues have been exacerbated by a huge increase in demand for travel following two years of Covid-enforced disruption. Some have warned the staffing issues, which came to a head last month as people rushed away for the first restriction free Easter Bank Holiday in more than two years, could last as long as a year. And last week EasyJet announced plans to remove seats on some of its planes this summer so that it can operate flights with fewer cabin crew as it too battles staffing issues. A Birmingham Airport spokesman said on Tuesday: 'Queues were managed and steadily moving this morning as we helped many of the more than 14,000 customers booked to fly out of BHX today. 'As always, we ask customers to arrive at the airport exactly when your airline advises - and to help us help you keep queues moving by removing any liquids, gels, pastes and electrical items from your bags before our security x-ray scanners.' A Bristol Airport spokesperson said: 'We apologise to customers impacted by above average queue times during early morning peak operations on Tuesday 10 May; airline check-in/bag-drop did not exceed 35 minutes with security experiencing a maximum queue time of 40 minutes. 'We work closely with all business partners to ensure staffing levels are sufficient to provide a good service to passengers with an average queue time of 30 minutes for security during peak times. 'However, on some occasions staff shortages can impact on waiting times and service standards. We constantly review resourcing across all areas and adapt plans to meet demand and build in resilience where possible. 'We have seen a strong increase in passenger numbers since the end of all COVID-19 travel restrictions. There is a huge pent-up demand for travel which has built up over the past two years during the pandemic and we are expecting a busy summer. 'Whilst recruiting and training new colleagues for the airport can take time, the Bristol Airport team and business partners will be working hard to ensure all customers have a smooth and easy journey through our terminal. 'We advise all customers to arrive in the terminal a minimum of two hours before scheduled flight departure time to allow sufficient time to complete all the necessary check-in, bag-drop, security, and boarding processes ahead of their flight.'

Entrepreneur and athlete Louis Phillips, 23, would normally be considered a picture of health and wellness -- he's very athletic, and is the cofounder of a gym business.  But a bout of influenza left Mr Phillips bedridden and on a hospital drip for the past week, as doctors warn the flu is coming back with a vengeance this winter after two years of Covid-safe measures.  Mr Phillips said his experience began as a regular bout of influenza - but when the going got tougher he knew he needed the help of medical professionals.  'It started as a normal flu and fever but it just didn't seem to be getting any better,' he said.  'I couldn't get any fluids or food down which also meant no Panadol or Ibuprofen. Then of course that made my headache worse and general condition decline.  'My energy was so low, I could hardly stand or walk.' Mr Phillips said he was coughing all the time, had a brutal headache and 'couldn't really see very well'. 'It felt like my eyes were crossing. I'd get super fatigued after doing really easy things like filling up a bottle of water,' he said. When his early symptoms got progressively more intense and serious Mr Phillips took himself to hospital.  'I was confident it was a flu but I just wasn't sure how rough it could get.  'When I kept declining I was getting more and more worried It was something else. Not sure what I thought it was but knew it needed someone with medical knowledge to look over it.' Mr Phillips headed to the hospital on Thursday. He went through two bags on an IV drip to get his fluid levels higher.  Because of his symptoms he had hardly consumed anything in 48 hours. 'I got put straight onto a drip and started to feel better. My mistake was a lack of fluids early on, I wish I drank more water, Gatorade, and general electrolytes.'  'My temperature went from 39.5 to 38.5 degrees in two hours. The nurses and doctors are genuine legends, they worked so fast.'  Mr Phillips was allowed out of hospital late on Thursday night and says he's feeling much better now.  His story is one many Australians have already faced. On Thursday, New South Wales Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said influenza cases have already been rising quickly already this year. 'There were 2,000 new flu cases notified in NSW in the week ending 7 May 2022, compared with 1,024 cases in the previous week, as well as around 60 emergency department presentations for flu-like illness that required an admission to hospital,' Dr Chant said. Doctors have warned that 'super' colds and flus will sweep across Australia this coming winter in the wake of Covid lockdowns. Doctors have urged the public to make use of the flu vaccines, Last November a so-called 'super cold' first appeared in the UK, with victims suffering flu-like or Coronavirus-like symptoms, but repeatedly testing negative to Covid. Now as Daily Mail Australia reported earlier this year, a similar outbreak is happening in Australia.  The symptoms of a 'super flu' are similar to colds, flu and Covid - which can can be difficult to tell apart. 'We are seeing more of these upper respiratory tract infections,' Sydney GP Dr Charlotte Hespe told Daily Mail Australia. 'A cold is a classic viral upper respiratory tract infection - irritable sneezing nose, lots of fluid from your nose, cough, sore throat, runny, sticky eyes.  'You may also get a sort of raspy cough but that's it by and large. You should recover within five to seven days.' But she warned Australia was ripe for a flu outbreak - and it is much harder to tell the difference between flu and the Omicron Covid strain with its milder symptoms.  'We will see the flu emerging more,' she said. ' 'The flu is very unpleasant.  'It's similar to the symptoms of Covid; you get headache, aches, pains and a fever. 'To diagnose flu, you need a fever and headache as well as some respiratory symptoms such as the sore throat or nose and cough - but you might not get those. 'It's predominantly often those more systemic symptoms of being unwell with fever, headache, aches and pains and feeling miserable. Recovery is 10-14 days.' Tell-tale signs such as a loss of taste and smell are often Covid-only symptoms which can differentiate it from flu. Rapid antigen or PCR test results still remain the best way of identifying Covid. But GPs are now warning that Australia has never been more susceptible to colds and flus than it is right now after being cut off from the rest of the world for so long.  Travel bans during the pandemic combined with lockdown measures and mask mandates have dramatically reduced our immunity to normal flus and colds.  'People who we've been protected against from for the last two years are travelling again,' Dr Hespe added.  'They're bringing with them viruses that are rampant in the winter countries that aren't rampant here.' There are even fears the flu may kill more people than Covid this year.   'We have less immunity against the flu now because we've skipped two flu seasons,' epidemiologist Professor Catherine Bennett warned. 'You might see fewer coronavirus deaths in winter because vulnerable people are actually more vulnerable to flu.' Health chiefs have a flu shot campaign set to rollout within weeks but medics are worried vaccine fatigue will stop many from getting the jabs.  'We do have a vaccine and it is highly effective,' Dr Hespe said.  'But I'm hearing a lot of people saying, 'For goodness sake, I've had enough of this...' Please don't think that - it really does provide you with really good protection.'  'I am sure we going to have a particularly bad cold and flu season this year. 'I recommend everybody continues to wear face masks when you're in crowded situations - and particularly when you're around anybody who may not be well.  'And if you've got symptoms, stay at home and don't go and spread it to somebody else.' The 'super-cold' can be difficult to differentiate from the Omicron strain of Covid-19. The main difference is the flu-like 'super cold' should not result in a loss of taste or smell. Those are Covid-only symptoms.  The 'super-cold' usually involves an extreme sore throat, a hacking cough and migraines.  The similarities with Covid are aches, pains, fever and fatigue. Rapid antigen or PCR test results are the best way of identifying Covid.", "96ecb091fecfbb202d6e57f86973df82f489787ae468588b2f316f9b": "Two motorcyclists are lucky to be alive after they drove into a wired fence and were ripped off their bike.  The pair were travelling down a road at Jimboomba in Logan City, south of Brisbane. Dashcam footage from a car driving behind them showed only the driver was wearing a helmet. His passenger, wearing sweat pants and a bum-bag, dangled his feet over the sides of the vehicle with his shoes hovering just centimetres from the road. The motorcyclist was then seen cutting across the opposite lane before heading towards an empty field. A front fence had been set up around the perimeter of the field with its wiring difficult to see. The motorbike passed through the fence before the motorcyclists were flung from their vehicle.  They were seen tumbling to the ground as the bike toppled over onto the grass.  Footage of the accident was uploaded to Facebook where social media users were unsympathetic. 'They rode* into a fence?? Wtf did they think was going to happen...' one person commented. Another added: 'Should of gone to spec savers'.

The Type 815 vessel bristling with the latest electronic surveillance equipment has been tracking 'close' to the coast for the last week or so, he revealed on Friday. The Dongdiao Class Auxiliary Intelligence ship was sighted at 0600 hrs this morning, 250 nautical miles north-west of Broome and tracking north-east at 12 knots. Its sudden appearance near the naval communications base supporting US and allied submarines in the Indian Ocean comes eight days before the federal election. 'It's strange timing and it's without precedent a vessel would be so far south,' Mr Dutton said. 'It is an aggressive act. Clearly, its intention is to gather intelligence.'  Defence chiefs are keeping tabs on the ship's movements - which has crossed into Australia's exclusive economic zone - from the air and sea, according to sources.  Mr Dutton added: 'It's obviously very strange that it's come this far south, and it's hugging the coastline as it goes north towards Darwin.  'Its intention will be to collect as much electronic intelligence as it can - and that's just very unusual. It does cause us concern. 'We haven't seen a ship from the People's Liberation Army Navy come this far south.'  He believed the warship may be gathering vital data for underwater submarine routes in the area and attempting to listen in on top secret radio messages. 'There's certainly the desire for them to to look hydrographically, which is why they've sent vessels from time to time, he said. 'So, to look at routes for submarines, to look at coastline, facilities and and importantly, the Harold E Holt facility is in that area.' The Harold E Holt Naval Communication Station near Exmouth, WA, is a top secret joint US/Australian Navy base. An intelligence source confirmed Chinese surveillance vessels have been tracking ships going in and out of the facility for years and have also been actively mapping the ocean floor topography in the area. Mr Dutton said China had ripped up the diplomatic rule book by arriving unannounced off the coast in this fashion. 'There is essentially an international protocol, which would normally include that contact to the Australian authorities which hasn't happened,' he said.  The defence minister insisted that publicly releasing the sensitive military intelligence so close to election day was not without precedent.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: 'They're looking at us, and we're keeping a close eye on them. I think we just have to highlight this is obviously an issue of concern.'  In February, the government revealed details of a flashpoint when Chinese military vessels turned blinding lasers on Australian surveillance aircraft in the Arafura Sea, north of Australia.  Mr Dutton added: 'I think people understand the difficulty that's the reality of the Indo-Pacific at the moment. 'The acts of aggression from the Chinese leadership and from the Chinese government - I think Australians deserve to know what what is taking place. 'We don't know whether [the spy ship] continues to traverse across the north of our country, or whether it goes back up further in a more northerly direction than what it currently is. 'But that's something that we'll monitor at the moment and I think it's it's best that we're able to release that detail. 'It's best to be open and honest with the Australian public and this is not a problem of Australia's making.' He warned of the situation Japan was now facing with 'hundreds' of Chinese 'militia' vessels in the East China Sea which 'are bumping up against the Japanese coast guard vessels on a daily basis'. He added: 'That's not an act of aggression from Japan. It's not Japan that's changed.' Mr Dutton said India had also faced confrontations with their Chinese neighbour too. 'There have been Indian troops killed at the hands of Chinese troops over the course  of the last three years,' he said. 'It's right that would speak out against that activity. Where we see acts of aggression in our own region, we're right to speak out about it.  'We're standing up for our values. We're not going to compromise on our democracy.  'I want to normalise the relationship with China - like anyone, I don't want to see them continue down the path of aggression.' But he warned: 'I just don't think people have learned any of the lessons of history. 'You see this collaboration now between Russia and China between President Xi and President Putin.  'That's the circumstances in which we're living and when you look at what's happening in Europe at the moment, that causes us great concern.' A defence department statement added: 'Australia respects the rights of all states to exercise freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters and airspace, just as we expect others to respect our right to do the same.' China and Australia signed a vital free trade agreement in 2015 - but the relationship has been in freefall in recent years.  The Communist superpower is still Australia's largest two-way trading partner, accounting for nearly a third of our trade with the world. But diplomatic relations have slipped dramatically, sparked by the Covid pandemic and Australia's demands in June 2020 for an independent investigation into China's role. China warned Australia's 'attitude' would come at a cost in terms of tourism and trade, launching a trade war on Australian exports of beef, barley, lobsters and coal. President Xi Jinping hit back further in November 2020 with a list of 'grievances' against Australia, alleging anti-China research, raids on Chinese journalists and  visa cancellations. An embassy official told one journalist: 'China is angry. If you make China the enemy, China will be the enemy.' China also spoke out against Australia's role in the elite Five Eyes intelligence network with the USA, UK, Canada and New Zealand, and was further incensed when Chinese companies were banned from bidding to install Australia's 5G network. Events escalated when Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian posted a social media image of an Australian soldier 'holding a bloodied knife against the throat of an Afghani child' in the wake of the Brereton Report into military operations. Prime Minister Scott Morrison demanded a formal apology for the shocking image, which was rejected by the Chinese government, and Twitter refused to take down the offensive post. In July 2021, two Chinese spy ships - including the Haiwangxing, currently off the WA coast - were seen close to the joint Australian-US Exercise Talisman Sabre, monitoring the wargames off the coast of Queensland. Tensions were ramped up again when Australia revealed its plans to scrap its submarine deal with France for the new AUKUS deal with the US and UK in September 2021. China reacted furiously to the news and said it would 'seriously damage regional peace and stability, exacerbate an arms race and harm international nuclear nonproliferation agreements....This is utterly irresponsible conduct.' Chinese military ships returned to Australian waters in November 2021 - sailing through the Torres Strait and down the eastern coastline - but at the time Prime Minister Scott Morrison insisted they were entitled to be there.  In February though, RAAF surveillance aircraft were blasted by blinding high-powered military-grade lasers fired at them from a Chinese naval destroyer in Australian waters, north-east of Darwin. And in March, the Solomon Islands revealed details of their controversial new security pact with China on Australia's doorstep. ", "e39f5701b404e5cc343a23f319797c2853700c9039b6f8a59c2e8aa2": "The man who may become Australia's Deputy Prime Minister met with Chinese embassy staff and officials three times after Beijing froze the nation out, sparking concern among his own party and spy agencies.  Labor's Richard Marles even held talks with former ambassador Cheng Jingye - who kickstarted China's campaign of economic coercion against Australia and penned the notorious list of 14 demands the Communist superpower wanted the country to kowtow to.  Mr Marles' regular contact with the openly hostile embassy raised eyebrows even within his own party, who passed their concerns to intelligence agencies, according to reports.  The meetings came as Australian ministers were unable to meet with, or even speak to, their counterparts in Beijing and the country launched an unprecedented campaign of economic bullying against Australia.  That included arbitrary tariffs and bans on crucial Australian exports such as barley, seafood, coal and red wine, as well as copper and cotton.   In his discussions with the Chinese, the Victorian MP is understood to have inferred that 'diplomatic relations would improve under a Labor government', The Australian reported. By comparison, Foreign Minister Marise Payne has only met with Chinese officials twice since 2018, with her last sit down coming in January, 2020, before Beijing diplomats and embassy staff refused to answer the phone calls of Australian officials. The diplomatic deep freeze came after the Morrison government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the Covid pandemic in April, 2020. Beijing reacted with fury to the suggestion of transparency, punishing Australia with punitive measures involving more than $20billion worth of key exports for daring to speak out.  But despite tensions escalating between the two nations, Mr Marles held meetings with Chinese officials - once in 2020 and twice in 2021. Yet another sit down was also scheduled to go ahead in March 2022 with the new Chinese ambassador, Xiao Qian, but the meeting was postponed. Sources revealed that the former deputy chair of the joint committee on intelligence and security, Anthony Byrne, and the late Kimberley Kitching, were among those who were alarmed. Part of their initial concern focused on a speech he gave to the Beijing Foreign Studies University in 2019, where he said Australia must 'respect China'. The Chinese embassy organised the trip and demanded he clear his speech with Chinese officials in Canberra before letting him board the plane. His address made no mention of the erosion of democratic freedoms in Hong Kong or the horrific treatment of the oppressed Uyghur population. Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Mr Marles for comment. His office told The Australian that Mr Marles always had staff members present for the meetings and was never alone when meeting with Chinese officials. 'Mr Marles has always engaged in professional diplomacy both during his time as a minister and shadow minister- this is not a secret,' a spokesperson said. 'Desperate attempts by others to suggest otherwise, are now getting beyond the pale and don't stand up to the facts.' Liberal Senator James Paterson, Australia's Intelligence and Security Committee Chair, said the meetings are no laughing matter. 'The Australian people deserve complete transparency about Richard Marles' relationship with the Chinese government,' he told Radio 2GB. 'While he was having this extraordinarily high number of meetings with Chinese officials, the Chinese government was economically coercing Australia and refusing to meet with Australian government ministers. 'It really is questions for Richard Marles to answer, and not to flippantly dismiss with jokes about Peking duck.' The revelations come after Australia's top spy chief Mike Burgess warned in February there has been an 'unprecedented' threat of foreign espionage and interference in recent years. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) Director-General said several nations were working hard to influence lawmakers, government officials, media figures, business leaders and academics.  'The level of threat we face from foreign espionage and interference activities is currently unprecedented,' Burgess said in the agency's annual threat assessment. 'It is higher now than it was at the height of the Cold War.' 1. 'Incessant wanton interference in China's Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan affairs' 2. 'Siding with the US' anti-China campaign and spreading misinformation' 3. 'Thinly veiled allegations against China on cyber attacks without any evidence' 4.  'An unfriendly or antagonistic report on China by media' 5. Providing funding to 'anti-China think tank for spreading untrue reports'  6. 'Foreign interference legislation' 7. 'Foreign investment decisions' 8. 'Banning Huawei technologies and ZTE from the 5G network' 9. 'Politicisation and stigmatisation of the normal exchanges and coorperation between China and Australia' 10. Making statements 'on the South China Sea to the United Nations' 11. 'Outrageous condemnation of the governing party of China by MPs and racist attacks against Chinese or Asian people'  12. 'The early drawn search and reckless seizure of Chinese journalists' homes and properties'   13. Calls for an independent inquiry into Covid-19 14. 'Legislation to scrutinise agreements with a foreign government' ", "e0557d8304b131739cdc5b6e7f55a54c97ea24b3c68cb0f1411af1bf": "Senator Lindsey Graham has said he was wrong to describe Joe Biden as 'the best person' to lead the country after the January 6 insurrection. Graham was recorded praising Biden while speaking to New York Times reporter Jonathan Martin on the day of the riot itself - but changed his tune Thursday during an interview on Fox News. Anchor Jesse Watters asked the South Carolina senator during an evening broadcast whether he stood by his 2021 comments. 'I was wrong,' replied Graham, 66, who has been in the Senate since 2003. Graham said he had high hopes for the presidency of his friend - but that they were dashed just months later following a series of crises. 'I've known Joe for 30 years. He's a nice guy, but he's been a disaster as president.' The original quote of Graham recommending Trump resign and praising Biden as a unifier was originally shared in a new book Martin wrote with his colleague at the Times, Alexander Burns, titled This Shall Not Pass. 'We'll actually come out of this thing stronger,' Graham told Martin on Jan. 6, 2021. 'Moments like this reset. It'll take a while. People will calm down. People will [say] 'I don't want to be associated with that.' This is a group within a group. What this does, it'll be a rallying effect for a while, where the country says, 'We're better than this.'' When Martin asks if Biden will help bring the country together after the insurrection, Graham replies: 'Totally'. He'll add: 'He'll be maybe the best person to have, right? 'I mean, how mad can you get at Joe Biden?' Though in his interview with Watters Wednesday, Graham said he had changed his mind over the past  year. He was critical of Donald Trump's role in the run-up to the Capitol Riot, and said he had expected Biden, 79, calm the tensions. 'This was literally happening on the day of January 6. And I was hoping he would bring us together,' said Graham. 'Common sense tells you you want the president to be successful. 'But not only has he failed to bring us together. He has made us less safe. He's ruined our economy. All the bad guys are moving around the world. 'They didn't do this on Trump's watch because they were afraid of him. 'Nobody fears Joe Biden abroad, and at home his policies are failing.' Graham said he had been disappointed in his friend, who spent 36 years in the Senate. 'I would have loved him to have been successful, but the truth of the matter is that he has not been,' said Graham. 'So now it's time to pick a new president, that comes in 2024.

The scale of the crisis is revealed in the new analysis, which shows that only 43 percent of the usual national supply of baby formula is available. In Tennessee, 54 percent of the state's usual supply is out of stock, in Delaware the figure is 54 percent and in Texas it is 52 percent.  Montana and Nevada were also hard-hit by the crisis.  On the other end of the scale, Colorado was reporting the fewest problems, with 26 percent of the usual supply being out of stock. New Mexico and Indiana were the only other states to have supply issues at less than 30 percent. The data, captured during the first week in May, was obtained from Datasembly, which collects real-time data from 11,000 grocery stores nationwide to calculate the shortages per state. The situation this week is likely to be significantly worse, as parents panic-buy supplies and yet more stores run out of the products.  The problem began earlier this year, when a Michigan-based factory was found to have flouted Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hygiene procedures, and four babies were hospitalized after eating contaminated formula, with one dying. A spokesman for Abbott, which produces formula at the plant, denied that the bacteria had come from their factory. 'After a thorough review of all available data, there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses,' the spokesman told DailyMail.com on Wednesday. Yet the factory remains shut, and the heavily consolidated industry - already struggling with supply chain issues as a result of the pandemic - has been unable to compensate. One Tennessee mother, Wynter Balthrop, said that she and her husband 'went to six different stores and searched and called multiple others as far as three hours away from us -- and we were not able to find one can or bottle of her formula.' Balthrop's daughter Blakely, aged eight months, takes Enfamil's Nutramigen formula - a hypoallergenic variety. Nutramigen was and is the only formula that her baby is able to tolerate. She told Fox News Digital that, when she was unable to find the specific formula, she gave her daughter a generic one, which made her sick. 'I broke down in the car,' she said. 'I was panicking and sad for my girl because we had enough formula left to make one bottle -- and I knew we would have to use the generic formula that hurt her stomach again. And that broke my heart. 'I mean, it just wasn't fair to her. But we had no other options.' She said she is now stockpiling as much as she can at her home in Gallatin, 30 miles from Nashville. 'We are now grabbing every can or ready-to-feed bottle we see, while also trying not to be greedy and leave some for others.' She said that there was rising panic among mothers. 'I've seen the fear in their eyes over the empty shelves at stores.' Biden on Thursday met with executives from two large producers of baby formula - Gerber and Reckitt - to discuss how they could increase production and how his administration could help. He also talked with leaders from Walmart and Target about how to restock shelves and address regional disparities in access to formula, the White House said. The administration plans to monitor possible price gouging and work with trading partners in Mexico, Chile, Ireland and the Netherlands on imports - even though 98 percent of baby formula is domestically made. Meanwhile, the shortage became politicized as Republicans including the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, criticized the Biden administration for providing baby formula to babies in detention at the U.S.-Mexico border.  Florida Congresswoman Kat Cammack, a Republican, tweeted two images on Thursday, protesting at the formula being sent to the border. One image showed full shelves of baby formula and food from a processing center at the southern border; the second was showing empty shelves where baby formula was supposed to be at an American grocery store. 'The first photo is from this morning at the Ursula Processing Center at the U.S. border. Shelves and pallets packed with baby formula,' Cammack wrote.  'The second is from a shelf right here at home. Formula is scarce. 'This is what America last looks like,' she added. The problem is the result of supply chain disruptions and a safety recall, and has had a cascade of effects: Retailers are limiting what customers can buy, and doctors and health workers are urging parents to contact food banks or physicians' offices, in addition to warning against watering down formula to stretch supplies or using online DIY recipes. The shortage is weighing particularly on lower-income families after the recall by formula maker Abbott, stemming from contamination concerns.  The recall wiped out many brands covered by WIC, a federal program like food stamps that serves women, infants and children, though the program now permits brand substitutes.  The Biden administration is reportedly working with states to make it easier for WIC recipients to buy different sizes of formula that their benefits might not currently cover. About half of infant formula nationwide is purchased by participants using WIC benefits, according to the White House. Belle Holmes, like many other parents, is struggled to find her six-month-old's preferred formula brand amid the nationwide shortage. 'We have had to switch brands three times and each one has eventually gone out of stock,' she told DailyMail.com. Her son suffers from a severe dairy allergy which makes it significantly harder to provide him with the proper nutrients he needs.  She also has to worry about adverse reactions caused by exposure to allergens.  Holmes shared photographs of her son's back covered in a rash that she has linked to consuming a new brand of formula. Additionally, the concerned mother explained that she cannot turn to breast feeding because she 'could not keep up with his demand' and was worried she 'would severely impact him' if she consumed any dairy whatsoever. 'We are on the last brand we can find and are nervous about what will happen next,' she added. Jillian and Chris Arroyo, of Falls Church, Virginia, have called on legislators to take action after Jillian was forced to resume breastfeeding amid the formula shortage. 'Our daughter needs this formula. Kids rely on this formula to survive,' Chris added, criticizing a remark made by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Monday.  'Based on yesterday's briefing by the White House, it seems like the attitude in general is to keep letting the FDA call the shots.  'Jen Psaki said the FDA is 'working around the clock to address any possible shortage.'  'The problem is - it's not a possible shortage. It's a very real shortage, and leaving this in the FDA's court is not solving the problem.' Jillian, adding to her husband's remarks, shared how she was forced to resume pumping and breastfeeding in an effort to feed their daughter Ellie, 21 months.

'I needed to be available to my daughter during this time and remove the stress and pressure around returning to the office,' she said. However, Ellie's return to breast milk was anything but smooth sailing.  'Our daughter has reacted to foods through my breastmilk since birth.  'After extensive food journaling and trial and error, I eliminated all the problem foods from my diet,' Jillian explained.  'We figured we'd be good to go, introduce her to solid foods, and wean her from breastmilk by her first birthday - the typical course. 'Ellie's journey has been anything but typical, and I breastfed on this elimination diet long past her first birthday until we finally found Elecare Jr.  'Once she'd been stable on her new formula for a few months, we made the decision to wean, and on February 12th, I nursed Ellie for what I thought was the last time.  'For six days I ate and drank whatever I wanted, carefree, with the weight of the world lifted off my shoulders.  'I was no longer the primary nutrition source for our medically challenging daughter, I no longer had to think about my own food intake around the clock, and I could eat and enjoy whatever I wanted. It was a really joyous week.' She continued: 'Six days later, we learned about the recall. I'm back on this diet for the foreseeable future.  'Until Ellie's formula is back in production, or we find a suitable alternative that she can tolerate, I am unable to eat dairy, wheat, soy, oats, peanuts, tree nuts, coconut, or tomatoes.  'The last time I saw my own doctor, she sarcastically told me it was kind of me to donate my skeleton to my daughter.  'It may have been sarcastic, but it was deeply rooted in truth - women who breastfeed are already at risk of nutritional deficits because our bodies will feed our babies first, leeching whatever nutrients are needed from our own stores. This is especially amplified by cutting out entire food groups, such as dairy. 'I never imagined I would be nursing my daughter past a year old. I certainly never imagined I would be nursing her at two or beyond, but the way things are going, I don't see a way out of this situation.  'I'm concerned for my physical and mental health.' Like many others, the Arroyo family has spent hundreds of dollars online purchasing their daughter's formula from price-gouging resellers.  They also started a Facebook group demanding authorities reopen the Abbott plant and are encouraging other parents to lobby their state and local leaders. Clara Hinton, 30, of Hartford, Connecticut, is among that group. She has a 10-month-old daughter, Patiennce, who has an allergy that requires a special formula. Hinton, who has no car, has been taking the bus to the suburbs, going from town to town, and finally found some of the proper formula at a box store in West Hartford.  But she said the store refused to take her WIC card, not the first time that has happened. Hinton said her baby recently ran out of formula from an already opened can she got from a friend. 'She has no formula,' she said.  'I just put her on regular milk. What do I do? Her pediatrician made it clear I'm not supposed to be doing that, but what do I do?' In Utah, fellow WIC card holder Elizabeth Amador has been going store-to-store every day after she finishes work at a call center in Salt Lake City in desperate search of one particular formula her nine-month-old daughter needs.  She recently was down to only one can, but had four cans on Thursday.  She said she won't stop her cumbersome daily routine until she knows the shortage is over. 'It sucks, you know because of high gas prices,' Amador said.  'We're having to drive everywhere to find formula. It's stressing.' Some parents are also using social media to bridge supply gaps. Ashley Maddox, a 31-year-old mother of two from San Diego, started a Facebook group on Wednesday after failing to find formula for her five-month-old son, Cole, at the commissary on the Navy base.  Abbott Laboratories, the biggest baby formula supplier in the U.S., ceased production at its Michigan plant in February 2022 amid reports of fatal bacterial infections. A timeline of events shows reveals the shut down was the plant had previously been under scrutiny by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  September 2021: The FDA conducted a four-day inspection of the Abbott Laboratories plant in Sturgis, Michigan. The inspection report revealed the plant 'did not maintain' clean and sanitary conditions in at least one building that manufactured, processed, packaged or held baby formula. FDA officials also observed poor hand washing among Abbott plant staff who 'worked directly with infant formula.' The FDA also noted an instance of improper equipment maintenance and temperature control.  October 2021: A whistleblower sends the FDA a 34-page document outlining potential concerns with the Sturgis plant.  The document, which was made public by Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro in April 2022, was written by a former plant employee.  The employee accused the plant of lax cleaning practices, falsifying records, releasing untested infant formula, and hiding information during an FDA audit in 2019, among other issues.  January - March 2022: The FDA conducted multiple inspections at the Sturgis plant over the course of three months in 2022. A ten-page inspection report revealed multiple violations at the facility. The agency alleged the plant failed to ensure that all surfaces that contact infant formula were maintained to prevent cross-contamination. The report states the facility 'did not establish a system of process controls' to ensure the baby formula 'does not become adulterated due to the presence of microorganisms in the formula or the processing environment.' Officials also alleged the plant failed to disclose in an investigation report whether a health hazard existed at the facility. Additionally, the report stated plant workers were did not wear the 'necessary protective material' when working directly with infant formula. February 17: U.S. health officials urgently warn parents against using three popular baby formulas manufactured at the Abbott plant in Michigan. Investigators claim the products were recently linked to bacterial contamination after an infant died and three others fell ill. Abbott voluntarily recalled several major brands and shut down its Sturgis plant.  The FDA also said it is investigating four reports of infants who were hospitalized after consuming the formula, including one who died. February 28: Abbott Laboratories expanded its recall of Similac baby formulas after a second infant who was exposed to the powdered baby formula died. April 15: Abbott releases a statement alleging it is working closely with the FDA to restart operations at the Sturgis plant.  Week of April 24: The nationwide share of out-of-stock baby formula hit 40 percent. Texas, Tennessee, Missouri, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota, seemingly hardest hit by the shortages, reported out-of-stock rates of about 50 percent. May 10: Abbott releases a statement to DailyMail.com claiming 'thorough investigation' by the FDA and Abbott revealed 'infant formula produced at our Sturgis facility is not the likely source of infection in the reported cases and that there was not an outbreak caused by products from the facility'. Abbott claims they are 'working closely with the FDA to restart operations' at the plant, with the spokesperson noting: 'We continue to make progress on corrective actions and will be implementing additional actions as we work toward addressing items related to the recent recall'. The FDA told DailyMail.com it was holding discussions with 'Abbott and other manufacturers to increase production of different specialty and metabolic products' but refused to say when the Sturgis plant could reopen. Sen. Mitt Romney issued a letter to the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) urging leaders to address the formula shortage and work to prevent future threats to infant health. May 11: Lawmakers on Capitol Hill announce plans to hold a hearing in two weeks on infant formula shortages. Abbott announced it would take up to ten weeks for the company to get baby formula to retailers once the Sturgis plant reopens. Abbott also said: 'After a thorough review of all available data, there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses.' 'I connected with a gal in my group and she had seven cans of the formula I need that were just sitting in her house that her baby didn't need anymore,' she said.  'So I drove out, it was about a 20-minute drive and picked it up and paid her. It was a miracle.' She said there was already a stigma attached to being a non-breastfeeding mother, and that the group has become supportive.  'To not be able to have that formula, it's scary,' she said. Jennifer Kersey, 36 of Cheshire, Connecticut, said she was down to her last can of formula for her seven-month-old son, Blake Kersey Jr., before someone saw her post on a Facebook group and came by with a few sample cans.  She said she and others in the group are helping each other, finding stores that might have the formula in stock and getting it to mothers who need it. 'At first I was starting to panic,' she said.  'But, I'm a believer in the Lord, so I said, 'God, I know you're going to provide for me' and I just started reaching out to people, 'Hey do you have this formula?'' Kimberly Anderson, 34, of Hartford County, Maryland, said her 7 1/2-month-old son takes a prescription formula that has been nearly impossible to find locally.  She turned to social media and said people in Utah and Boston found the formula, which she paid to have shipped. 'They say it takes a village to raise a baby,' she said.  'Little did I know my village spans the entire U.S. as I ping friends, family for their zip codes so I can check their local Walmarts to have them ship directly to me.' Melissa Paolini, of Sicklerville, New Jersey, is organizing a rally of mothers struggling to feed their children and calling on federal officials to take action. 'It is unreal that we live in America in 2022 and can't feed our babies,' she told DailyMail.com.  'Moms are having to switch formulas for their babies nonstop. It's so unfair. We need to stand up about this. We are our babies voice!' Paolini's four-month-old son is on a special diet and uses a formula from a company called Stymco.  The New Jersey mother said she ordered the product more than a week ago, but it has yet to arrive.  'I get my son's month supply from them,' she explained.  'They never contacted to tell me it wasn't coming.' She said that several other parents have cited the same complaints. 'This isn't the only company that people are having issues with. It's everywhere,' she argued.  'I've called the GI doctor and the pediatrician. No one can help.' Paolini argued that the shortage isn't just impacting families utilizing special dietary products, but has those who use standard, popular brands scrambling too. 'I know parents with children on nearly every formula are in a similar situation. They just may have a little more luck finding their formula in a store than me,' she said. 'As a mom we try to do everything we can for our babies. I have cried hysterical over this so much. A solution needs to be found.' In response, Paolini is working to organize an event in which parents can come together and rally on behalf of their children. She said event planning remains in the early stages, but in the meantime, she will continue to outreach to her congressmen and senators.  'If more people don't rise up, I don't think anything will be done about this crisis,' she said.  'I want the U.S. to be addressing this issue. This is our babies. This is our future.' Shortages of basic goods have been a problem since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.  Access to medical supplies, computer chips, household appliances, cars and other goods has been hurt by closed factories and outbreaks of the virus, as well as storms and other climate-related events. Parents desperately searching for infant formula on retailer websites such as Amazon and Google are being served up with products intended for toddlers, including powdered toddler goat milk and plant-based milk powders. One banner ad across Amazon offers 'organic non GMO formula for babies & toddlers,' but a closer inspection of the product's image shows that it is only intended for children over 12 months.  Other ads for toddler milk appear on Amazon's website on pages for out-of-stock infant formula. Toddler milk cans often closely resemble that of infant formula, but the ingredients are distinct, with toddler milks sometimes boasting more sugar, calories, said Frances Fleming-Milici, UConn's Director of Marketing Initiatives at the Rudd Center who has study toddler milk packaging.  Toddler milk also does not follow FDA standards for formula. 'It's not like you're buying a pair of shoes. This is a little bit more serious,' Fleming-Milici said.  'It's serving up something that you should not be giving to your child.' Dr. Navneet Hundal, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said she and other pediatricians have been grappling with the formula shortage for months.  Formula companies have stopped giving out samples that she could pass on to parents, she said.  She advises new parents to talk to their pediatricians to see if there are other brands of formula that they can safely give their newborns. 'This is ruling our clinical practices right now,' she said. A safety recall compounded the challenges. The Food and Drug Administration warned consumers on February 17 to avoid some powdered baby formula products from a Sturgis, Michigan, facility run by Abbott Nutrition, which then initiated a voluntary recall.  According to findings released in March by federal safety inspectors, Abbott failed to maintain sanitary conditions and procedures at the plant. The FDA launched its investigation after four babies became sick with a rare bacterial infection after consuming formula manufactured at the plant. All four were hospitalized and two died.  Chicago-based Abbott said in a statement: 'there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses.'  Samples of the bacteria collected from the infants did not match those found in the company's factory, Abbott noted. Abbott said that pending FDA approval, 'we could restart the site within two weeks.'  The company would begin by first producing EleCare, Alimentum and metabolic formulas and then start production of Similac and other formulas.  Once production began, it would take six to eight weeks for the baby formula to be available on shelves. On Tuesday, the FDA said it was working with U.S. manufacturers to increase their output and streamline paperwork to allow more imports. 'We recognize that this is certainly a challenge for people across the country, something the president is very focused on and we're going to do everything we can to cut red tape and take steps to increase supply,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.", "717b8b77e4546bdebfa5d9133572a1ea348e296dfdaa9232cb54d6f0": "Devastated residents returned to what's left of their multi-million dollar homes less than 24 hours after a wildfire ripped through the community of Laguna Niguel.  Heartbreaking images captured the moment residents realized they had lost everything. The community's former mayor Fred Minagar described the once quiet community as being like 'war-zone.' A woman who raised her family in a home that has been reduced to rubble said she wasn't sure if they would try to rebuild their $3 million house. 'Maybe it will be too hard,' she said. While a married couple whose wedding photo was one of the few salvagable items from their home said that less than a year ago, they lost their business to a fire.   At least 20 multi-million dollar mansions were reduced to rubble in just a matter of hours. The Coastal Fire, which began on Wednesday afternoon near a water treatment facility in Aliso Woods Canyon, has destroyed also damaged another 11, according to the Orange County Fire Department. More than 500 firefighters, some from as far away as San Diego and Long Beach, have been fighting the flames while 900 homes in the area have been evacuated.  When DailyMail.com visited on Thursday, most of the fire had been put out in the Coronado Point neighborhood but flames could still be seen licking up the other side of Seaview canyon on which the community sits. More than 24 hours after the outbreak, the blaze is only 15% contained, according Orange County Fire Authority division chief Shane Sherwood, who spoke at press conference on Thursday night. Sassan Darian, 38, sat on a curb watching firefighters douse the remains of his father's five-bedroom home and recounted how he, his daughter and his father fled as winds blasted flames toward them and embers fell on them and around them. 'The sky, everything was orange. It looked like an inferno, so we just jumped in the car,' he said. 'My daughter said, 'We're on fire.' There were sparks on her and we were patting ourselves down.' Darian earlier posted videos on his Facebook page showing his father looking down as the fire began in the valley beneath his father's home.   The day after the fire, Darian posted a photo of his father's burned down house. He wrote in the caption: 'My old friends from back in the day - remember the crazy party I had here when we were youngins?'   After being evacuated, Darian wrote on Facebook: 'That was too close for comfort. I got live embers on my clothes when we evacuated.'  Darian went on to tell NBC Los Angeles: 'It looks like it's completely demolished. It might look like a horror zone. It might look like a movie, but everyone will be able to repair and replace.' Orange County resident and former mayor of Laguna Niguel Fred Minager described the scene as being 'like a war zone,' in an interview with Fox11. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Sandy Vogel said that she lived in her Coronado Pointe neighborhood for three decades. The bird house pictured above had been part of their home for 20 years.  Vogel told the Times: 'We didn't think our house was going to burn, but the winds were so strong yesterday that once the fire came up the hill there was no stopping it. We didn't know the house had burned until we saw it on the news.' When asked if she would remain in the community following the destruction, Vogel said: 'We'll rebuild and we'll see if we want to stay here. Maybe it'll be too hard.'  According to Zillow, Vogel's home was valued at over $3 million.  In a separate interview with NBC Los Angeles, Vogel pointed at the rubble and said: 'That was the living room. That was the family room.' She added: 'You can get through whatever devastation you're dealt. It's not always easy but you can make it as long as you're OK.' One man, Andreas Frank, who lost his home told CBS News: 'It's so random because just behind us, our friend's home is safe, but on either side it's destroyed.' A resident of a nearby road who asked not to give his name spoke about the fire's astonishing speed, telling DailyMail.com that it exploded into life and consumed 20 expensive homes in less than two hours. He said: 'The speed of the fire was shocking - the homes were on fire within two hours. I was driving home at 4pm and they were all on fire by 5.30.' The fire is now thought to have been sparked by power lines with power company Edison saying it detected 'circuit activity occurring close in time to the reported time of the fire'. Strong winds from the Pacific fanned the flames which roared through Seaview Park and over the Aliso Summit Trail before slamming into upscale Coronado Pointe.   The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but not long after the outbreak the local electricity company revealed that there was 'circuit activity occurring close in time to the reported time of the fire,' as residents say power went out before the flames erupted. One resident of the area told ABC7 that her power went out moments before she first heard emergency service sirens.    One resident Abi Forsoni described the scene as he was told evacuate, telling NBC Los Angeles: 'I saw flashes of fires just coming in my house and that's the time I left with my wife.  'It's horrible for residents. You don't know if your home is still there. We don't know. I have a lot of things. I didn't have time to take them.' Fortunately for Forsoni his home was still standing.  During the evacuation, resident Carson Williams told the NBA affiliate: 'The entire street is chaotic, right now.'  'It takes your breath away,' Julianna Shapiro, 52, told the LA Times as she watched her community burn. 'It's just so hard to watch, but I can't help not watch it. It's our neighbors losing their homes. You feel so hopeless.'  Lynn and Keith Morey's five-bedroom, four-and-a-half bathroom home with a two story library and office burned to the ground, less than one year after the couple lost their business to another fire. They had left the home earlier in the morning, ABC7 reports, and they did not have time to grab any of their belongings. As a result, Lynn lost the only photos she had left of her sister, who had passed away four years earlier. 'I'm more in shock than anything else,' Lynn said Wednesday night. Firefighters did manage to salvage the couple's wedding portrait from the wreckage. Orange County Fire Authority Captain William Lackey received a hug from Lynn.  Lackey told ABC7: 'Well it's a great feeling. It really is. It is a small reward in a really devastating day.'  A GoFundMe has now been set to help the couple rebuild. It was then shared on Facebook, by Lynne's niece, Heather Balaban, who wrote: 'My aunt Lynn and her husband Keith are the sweetest, most giving people I know. 'Their mission in life is [to] help heal others,' she explained, noting: 'They invite people in their home to stay with them all the time. 'Unfortunately, last night their home burnt to the ground, and they had no time to grab any of their belongings because they were evacuated in Laguna Niguel.' As of 1.30pm EST on Thursday, the online fundraiser had raised $1,550 from seven donors to help the family. Keith Morey told NBC Los Angeles that his Tesla was in their home's garage when the fire began. Neither him nor his wife were home when the fire made its approach to their community.  Hundreds of people were forced to evacuate from their homes in the area of Coronado Pointe, Vista Courte, Pacific Island Drive, Via Las Rosa, and the Ranch Golf Course and Resort at around 4pm. Sheriff's deputies ran between each house to tell people to leave. But Kevin Kothlow said he decided to stay, as he has fire fighting experience. He told the LA Times how he walked down a trail and watched as the fire spread. 'It literally just ran up the hill,' he said. 'I saw it hit the palm trees and as soon as I saw that I knew those houses were gone. You could see the embers blowing through the air.' Among those evacuated were Cheryl Flohr and her husband Mark, whose 48,500-square-foot home is in Palmea, the neighborhood next to the badly damaged Coronado Pointe. 'Fred Minagar immediately engaged and drove up and down the streets honking letting residents know,' Cheryl Flohr told The Orange County Register. 'They were so ready for us. I'm proud of my community and Laguna Niguel.' Mark Flohr told the paper he knew there was a fire when he heard aircraft overhead and then saw smoke. Then he drove over to a vacant area overlooking the steep canyons above The Ranch resort in Laguna Beach and saw the flames. Not long after, the couple got a knock on the door asking them to evacuate. Using a list they created more than a decade ago, they carried out what was important to them - photo albums, hard drives, devices and charging cords plus irreplaceable personal items. 'I brought a glass doll head my mother played with 100 years ago,' said Cheryl. Mark brought some old engineering tools and century-old books. The couple planned to stay with friends and family on Wednesday night. 'We came here first because we wanted to be where the information was,' Cheryl said. A spokesperson for the Southern California Con Edison, David Song said: 'Our thoughts are with the community members whose homes have been damaged and those who were evacuated because of the Coastal fire, and we're coordinating with fire agencies as needed to ensure firefighter safety.' Song added: 'Our top priority is the safety of customers, employees and communities, which is why we continue to enhance our wildfire mitigation efforts through grid hardening, situational awareness and enhanced operational practices.'    The blaze quickly reached the gated community at Coronado Pointe - where properties sell for between $1million and $10million - and the 30300 block of La Vue near the Summit Trail.  It then ripped across the area and began looming over homes on Coronado Pointe. As the first homes began to burn, the embers were cast into neighboring homes, causing a devastating domino effect. At least 20 homes in the exclusive enclave have already been engulfed by the fire and a further 100 were potentially in the wildfire's path, Orange County Sheriff's Capt. Virgil Asuncion said. Nine hundred homes remained under evacuation orders Thursday morning as flames continued to ignite. A state of emergency has now been declared, as the Coastal Fire consumed nearly 200 acres and firefighters continued to fight the flames.  There is no word on how much of the fire has already been contained. Meanwhile, photos show that one seven-bedroom, eight-bathroom home, which was listed for sale on Zillow for $9.89 million was completely gutted in the aftermath. The 10,000 square foot home at 5 Vista Court in Laguna Niguel, California had boasted its own 'children's wing' with a game room and study room, as well as a two-story bedroom and a 'wellness wing to house your meditation room, gym and very own Pilates studio with sauna and steam room.' It also included a separate outdoor pool overlooking the California mountains and Laguna Beach, as well as a four-car garage and a home theater. Property records show that it is currently owned by a shell corporation, which purchased the luxurious mansion for $6.275 million in September 2020. Another $6.6 million four-bedroom, seven bathroom mansion at 35 Coronado Pointe had also lost its roof entirely to flames as firefighters battled to save the walls and neighboring properties. Explosions were heard coming from one home - believed to be the sound of ammunition detonating. Smoke warnings remained in effect, and firefighters will likely remain on the scene through Friday, with Michelle Summers telling DailyMail.com her husband, who is a captain with the Ocean County Fire Association, 'it's the worst he's ever been on and he's got over 30 years.' Laguna Beach has been home over the years to famous faces including Diane Keaton, Bette Midler screenwriter and producer Ryan Murphy, and Hollywood's Golden Age star, Bette Davis. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has now approved federal funding to combat the growing fire. 'This support will ensure that state and local authorities have the resources they need to continue addressing this emergency to save lives and homes in our community,' Rep. Michelle Steel tweeted on Thursday. Sara Nuss-Galles also told DailyMail.com she and her husband, as well as their cats, are staying with friends a few miles from their home after they were forced to evacuate. They were able to grab important papers, passports, medications, toiletries and clothes, she said, as they keep a list of items they would need in case of an evacuation on their refrigerator.  Her house is now blocked off from traffic, she said, 'but apparently apart from ash, smoke and embers, the street is OK.' Most of the destruction, she said, was just about a quarter mile away from where she and her husband live, and they 'often walk on the ridge where so many houses burned. 'It's a beautiful hike and outlook,' Nuss-Galles said of the area, adding that the situation is 'heartbreaking for the people [who] live there.'   She said she is just grateful 'for the amazing firefighters themselves staying and keeping us all safe.' Residents near Moulton Meadows and Balbo Nyes were also advised to be prepared to evacuate at a moment's notice, but the warning was lifted before 10pm as officials said there is no immediate threat to the area. Laguna Beach high school had also been evacuated, and shelters have been set up in the area.  The fire spread quickly because wind had driven up embers into palm trees, attics and dense, dry brush on slopes and steep canyons that hadn't burned for decades, said Britain Fennessy, chief of the Orange County Fire Authority. Fennessy said climate change has made even small fires that once would have been easily contained into extreme threats to life and property throughout the West. Fennessy told ABC7 his team was trying to save as many homes as they could. 'It's all about defending the homes that have not already burned,' Fennessy said from the scene. 'The firefighters behind me are really putting on an aggressive fight,' Fennessy said at a press conference on Wednesday night he expected winds to die down after sunset, which would help slow the spread. He said there were no other major fires in Southern California, enabling firefighters from the area to concentrate their resources on Laguna Niguel. The hilltop city of about 65,000 people is just inland from the coastal city of Laguna Beach about 50 miles south of Los Angeles. Dry brush covers the surrounding hills and canyons, as California experiences historic drought.    The US Drought Monitor says that at the time of the fire, California is covered by 60% 'extreme drought.'  Meteorologist Bill South told CNN   'It's way too early' for a fire such as the one that burned through Laguna Niguel.  'Unfortunately I think this is what we're going to be experiencing over the next several weeks and years,' said Fennessy. The vegetation is so dry it is not taking much for the fire to take off running and burn very quickly.'   Mike Garcia, the Laguna Beach fire chief, said: 'It was a wind-driven fire. And since it started around 3pm on Wednesday it's gone eastward. 'It's becoming a pretty big fire, burning several homes in the city of Laguna Niguel. I want to tell our community that the city of Laguna Beach is safe. We don't expect any changes.  'But we want all of our residents to remain vigilant, be prepared, be aware.' He said they would notify residents of any changes, but people should be prepared to 'react quickly'. Ground and air crews from the Orange County Fire Authority and Laguna Beach Fire Department were working to extinguish flames moving uphill through light and moderately dense vegetation. Winds gusting up to 20 mph were fanning the flames, and relative humidity in the area was measured at 52 percent, said Mark Moede, from the National Weather Service. 'Gusts were up to 25 mph when the fire started,' Moede said at about 5pm. 'It will stay breezy for the next hour or so, but should drop-off as the sun drops below the horizon.' The last major fire in the area was the Emerald fire on February 24. The earlier fire grew to about 150 acres before it was extinguished. The first three months of 2022 have been the driest on record.   Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, responded on Tuesday by pledging to spend $100 million on a statewide advertising campaign to encourage water conservation.  The campaign will include traditional radio and television spots while also paying people with large followings on social media to urge others to save water.  He also promised to spend an $211 million to conserve more water in state government buildings by replacing plumbing fixtures and irrigation controls. In Los Angeles - the second most populous city in the U.S. - Mayor Eric Garcetti said residents and businesses would have to reduce outdoor landscape watering from three days per week to two.  Irrigation makes up 35 percent of the city's water use. Urban water use accounts for a relatively small percentage of California's overall water use when compared to agriculture. But the state's farmers have been suffering, too, as state and federal officials have reduced water allocations to zero in some places. Demand for non-agriculture water is typically low in March, which comes near the end of the state's rainy season. It can sometimes rain so much in March that it makes up for the rest of the year, a phenomenon officials have dubbed the 'March miracle.' But California got just 1 inch of precipitation in March while the temperatures were 3 degrees warmer than usual, further increasing water demand. A series of April storms have improved things slightly since March.  Still, most of the state's reservoirs are well below their historic averages.  The reservoirs depend on melted snow from the Sierra Nevada to replenish them for the dry summer months. But the statewide snowpack was at just 27 percent of its historic average as of April 1. 'This is what we have. This is what we're going to get. We can't expect anything significant past this date,' said Jeanine Jones, manager for interstate resources with the California Department of Water Resources. State officials said 20 percent of the wells they monitor are reporting all-time low water levels, while nearly half of them have less than 10 percent of their historic averages.  In some cases, the state is helping to haul water to small communities that don't have access to it. State officials said they were assisting 687 households through a small community drought relief program. Some larger communities were also in danger. Lindsay, a city of about 13,000 people in California's Central Valley, was projected to run out of water on July 1.  Federal officials approved an additional allocation for the city, which they now say will have enough water to last through February - provided they continue to conserve.", "bd48dec91201b1d6959836e75444a2c73da1341c4b0be9a8720c321f": "My jaw hit the floor during the Stonewall discrimination trial this week when the LGBT charity's 'head of trans inclusion' Kirrin Medcalf took the stand and declared: 'Bodies are not inherently male or female. They are just their bodies.' But as those words sank in, my heart sank to my boots too. I was one of the six co-founders of Stonewall in the 1980s. Along with the others, I poured all my energy into making the organisation a formidable force for gay and lesbian rights. All that work is now in danger of being wrecked, Stonewall's reputation discredited, and its credibility squandered, by trans activists -- not all trans people, I hasten to add -- who believe they can dictate what everyone is allowed to say and think. People such as Kirrin Medcalf imagine that reality can be reshaped to fit their requirements. Asked whether there is a difference between biological sex and gender preference, Medcalf denied it. According to the official Stonewall position -- and to disagree is to be regarded as a heretic or, in the current lingo, 'transphobic' -- people are literally whichever biological sex they choose to be. Medcalf appears unaware of the screaming contradictions in this position. One barrister asked pointedly about whether there are any circumstances where it would be OK to treat someone according to their biological sex. The Stonewall employee offered that this would be OK 'at a cervical screening service'. So it seems that even in Stonewall's world, there are still occasions when the reality of sex stubbornly resists the pretence. But it is Stonewall's trans activists, apparently, who have the privilege of choosing those occasions. Other people don't -- and, in particular, the definition of what 'a woman' is must never be left up to women themselves. This trial has become a spectacle of ludicrousness. The barrister Allison Bailey is suing her legal chambers, Garden Court in London's Lincoln's Inn Fields, for allegedly curbing her work and her income because of her view that there are only two sexes. She says she has been punished for speaking out against Stonewall's trans policies and arguing that it is undermining the hard-won rights of gay, lesbian and bisexual people in its determination to promote its trans doctrine. The trial descended into confusion before Kirrin Medcalf even took the stand. The activist's mother, solicitor and dog all had to be present at the tribunal to provide 'support' -- requirements that were apparently sprung upon the court without warning. When the hearing finally got under way, the statements became ever more baffling. Medcalf claimed that Stonewall had no choice but to advise people to avoid Garden Court Chambers, for fear of meeting Allison Bailey. Her statements were supposedly so virulent and hateful that any trans person who encountered her would be 'at risk of physical harm'. This is simply nonsense. Allison Bailey has never physically threatened anyone. She doesn't believe transwomen are actually women, and this enrages Stonewall, but it's a world away from physical violence. Medcalf appears to believe that words are the same as actions, that to say 'I don't like you' is the same as punching you in the face. A difference of opinion is being painted as a physical threat. According to Medcalf, any trans person encountering Bailey is at risk of attack. This is a completely imaginary scenario. Nothing of this kind has happened in real life. Yet Medcalf talks as though saying these things out loud somehow makes them true. It was former U.S. president Donald Trump who first gave us 'alternative facts'. When people challenged his version of reality, he used any form of coercion he could to shut them up. But it breaks my heart to see Stonewall adopt the same sort of tactics. I helped set up the campaign group in 1989, as a response to legislation known as Section 28 that prohibited the 'promotion of homosexuality' in schools. At that time, horrible bigotry was rife. James Anderton, the recently deceased former chief constable of Greater Manchester, had described people with Aids as 'swirling in a human cesspit of their own making'. A TV reviewer on one newspaper accused Ruby Wax, Julian Clary and me of 'seeping through broadcasting like the Aids virus'. Stonewall was born in an era of hostility, and we had to find a way of breaking down prejudice and building alliances with our critics. The best way to do this, we discovered, was not by screaming abuse or attempting to lay down the law. Instead, we used data and research to construct a wall of credibility. By amassing evidence about the effect of bullying and exclusion on gay teenagers, we were able to show how dangerous Section 28 was. We argued about the reality of prejudice and we forced Parliament to consider the facts, not the rhetoric. And then we did it again, on issues such as allowing gay people to serve in the Armed Forces. We did it so well that the social mood changed completely, enabling gay and lesbian people to enjoy real equality -- with same-sex couples eventually being given the right to marry, for example. The problem is now the reverse of what Stonewall faced three decades ago. Society is so keen to be inclusive and to respect diversity that it is open to manipulation. Everyone is terrified of appearing prejudiced. Any business that signs up to Stonewall's Diversity Champions programme, at PS2,500 a year, would certainly think long and hard before quitting it. The wrath of Stonewall is not a thing to be lightly provoked, as Allison Bailey has found out. Her lawyers have described this as a protection racket. I wouldn't go that far, but it highlights a serious problem with Stonewall's approach. Most Britons are very happy to see trans people treated fairly and equally, with decency and tolerance. Most trans people welcome that. But a small minority of activists, including those who have taken over Stonewall, do not want to extend that decency and tolerance to the rest of the population. Equality, to them, means imposing their views on everyone else, without debate. That should concern anyone who believes freedom of speech is sacrosanct. It is especially alarming to women who see their safe spaces breached by transwomen with intact male bodies. Sexual violence against women must never be ignored or belittled, yet Stonewall is saying that no one has the right to question the presence of a naked and obviously male interloper in a female changing room. Equally, women are told they cannot object to transwomen competing in their sports, despite copious data showing that cyclists, tennis players, swimmers and others with male bodies are at a colossal advantage when competing against females. Women who do speak out, even those as highly regarded as J.K. Rowling or Martina Navratilova, are told with vehemence to shut up. It often feels as though the trans debate has plunged us back into an era before feminism, when women were often treated as airheads with nothing to contribute to social discourse. By polarising the debate, and treating their version of trans rights as non-negotiable, Stonewall has opened up divisions. That makes me deeply frustrated and sad. I've spent my life trying to bridge those divides and build coalitions. Now people such as Kirrin Medcalf are taking a wrecking ball to that work and squandering Stonewall's hard-won credibility. I wish trans activists could see they don't need to force their views on everyone else. Their greatest strength is in diversity. When we marched in the first Pride demonstrations, we weren't asking to be straight -- we sang that we were 'Glad to be gay!' Let's celebrate our differences, not wipe out our diversity.", "2ede442b67f47560106d78f2f374aa3829dcf8db388c8e93a70e36fd": "R&B icon Bobby Brown believes that ex wife Whitney Houston would still be alive today had they stayed together - and fought their hard drug addictions. Emotional Bobby admits he remains heartbroken that Whitney could not kick cocaine and crack after he got sober. In his most frank ever interview, the R&B icon claims he speaks to his ex wife and their deceased daughter Bobby Kristina from beyond the grave. In a preview clip of a new A&E Network documentary, leaked to DailyMail.com, Brown also mustered the strength to visit his ex wife and their daughter's graves at Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, New Jersey for the first time. Bobby, 53, claims that the 'frightened' pair 'are looking down, watching me.' The former New Edition star serves up a raft of bombshells on camera including Whitney's out of control drug use, his heroin habit and even their intense impulsive sexual chemistry. However Bobby says their romance failed when he cleaned up but the Grammy winning star was still enjoying coke and booze binges. Bobby suffers daily heartbreak believing that had he fought harder Whitney would not have been found dead in an LA hotel room 10 years ago. He spoke too of how Whitney reached out to him in dreams to pull the plug on daughter Bobbi Kristina's life support after being found unresponsive in her Atlanta home bathtub in 2015. The jaw dropping revelations emerge in the new A&E special new series Biography: Bobby Brown. Reflecting on Whitney's shock death aged just 48, Bobby said: ' I think we could have helped each other out. 'I think she would still be here if we hadn't divorced. 'I wasn't there. I beat myself about it because I wasn't there. I wish I could have been there for her. 'We had made our beds and had to lie in them. We always felt that our love was strong enough to overcome any obstacle put in front of us. 'We would still be together if it wasn't for drugs. Drugs got the best of us.' He maintains Whitney is in touch with him in the afterlife visiting him in 'dreams'.  Bobby described the moment he realized that Bobbi Kristina would be a 'vegetable' for the rest of her life after a near-fatal drowning and drug intoxication. Bobbi Kristina spent months in hospice care before her father pulled the plug in July 2015. Bobby said: 'They told me she would not live a normal life. I was prepared to care for her for the rest of my life, being a vegetable. But my daughter would not like to live like that. 'Whitney came to me in dreams and (said) 'let my baby go!'. And that is what I had to do.' Getting tearful, he recalled how his daughter: 'lived life to the fullest'. 'Being her father meant everything to me. To know how special she was can only be seen through love. 'My daughter is with me every day. She is one of my angels.' Cameras followed the poignant moment he visited the graveside. Bobby kissed the head stone of Whitney whispering: 'I love you'. Addressing his late wife and daughter, he said: 'I brought you guys some flowers. Sorry I have not come by. 'Sorry this is my first time. But you guys know I don't like cemeteries. 'I know you are looking down watching me, watching your siblings. I hope you are taking care of little Bobby I know you guys are frightened up there. I miss you guys so much. Y'all take care of each other okay.' Welling up with tears, he then reached out to the head stone, he told his ex superstar wife: 'See you later. I love you.' Bobby was candid about the chemistry with Whitney. 'Me and Whitney's sex life was pretty intense. 'It did not matter where we were. It was about a certain look. She looked at me a certain way and it was on and poppin'. There was something about her that made me smile. Her smell - this certain perfume she wore.' However Bobby learned that Whitney's drug needs were as extreme as his moments before they tied the knot on July 18, 1992. 'I walked in and saw her doing a line of coke. 'It was a shocker to me seeing her sniff for the first time. 'It was then I realized we had more in common than I thought. I was new to it and I guess she had been doing it for a while. That became a problem for us in our marriage.' Bobby labelled their increasing drug dependency a 'disease', adding: 'After I got married that is when I started using hard drugs. We were going through the stresses of stardom, fame, money, drugs and rock'n'roll. 'We started not working, getting high and it became a part of our daily routine.' His lowest point came before he quit the New Edition Home Again reunion tour crippled with addiction and paranoia in 1996. 'I used to smoke preempt - crack cocaine inside weed. You roll them up. I was so high. 'I thought Whitney was trying to kill me. I ended up running through a field. I had a 57 magnum on me, cocaine, crack and weed in this. 'My addiction affected my career big time.' Bobby says a jail stint for probation violations on a DUI in 2003 helped him get clean - but with Whitney still using it began the demise of their marriage. 'Before I went to jail I had started using heroin, along with crack and weed. I was only sniffing, not shooting it. I was able to kick heroin and crack in jail. I did it on my own.' Whitney picked him up with drugs and booze in the car. 'I knew I had moved into a different realm. Whitney was still using hard drugs. That is when the problems started with me and her I wanted her to become sober like I was but it was really hard for both of us to stay together and be together.' They filed for divorce in October 2006. Bobby never knew Whitney had a lesbian relationship with childhood friend Robyn Crawford before they wed in 1992. But once he tied the knot, Robyn had no place in their lives. 'I didn't know Whitney's relationship with Robyn was more than just friends 'til later on in our marriage. It was what it was. 'You are newly married you want to spend all your time with the person you're married to, and a third person is usually a hanger on. 'I did not kick Robyn out of the relationship. Our marriage was growing and there was no room for a third person. 'Robyn was a good friend to Whitney and I can say I wish Robyn was still in her life in the end, because Robyn was all around a good person.'

Other offending related to large amounts of extremely graphic child exploitation images, including screaming babies being abused, which he viewed and discussed with other pedophiles. Grant Harden, 31, pleaded guilty to 179 state and commonwealth charges relating to the sexual abuse of seven young boys, and online dissemination and storage of child abuse material involving thousands of images. In the NSW District Court on Friday, Judge Sarah Huggett jailed him for 30 years with a non-parole period of 22 years. The earliest date he can be considered for parole is in May 2042. The contact charges included multiple counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years, while some of his filmed abuse was of sleeping or preoccupied boys. The abuse included digital and anal penetration as well as fellatio. Harden had gained the trust of the boys and their parents, creating an environment where he could abuse the victims and conceal his offending for his own sexual gratification, the judge said. 'The majority of the contact offences are captured in video recordings,' she said. He posted these online, trading the images for other explicit images. After his arrest in May 2020, he co-operated with authorities, made significant admissions and handed over his passwords. This co-operation, his guilty pleas and acceptance of responsibility was evidence of remorse and contrition, the judge said. But she noted it could be said the case against him was overwhelming given he created a record of his abuse. A 'troubling' matter was his limited insight into his offending, revealed in his statements that one boy had enjoyed and initiated some of the acts and no harm was done to abused sleeping children. In a victim impact statement, the mother of one boy said because of the abuse she had no trust left for anyone. '(Her son) doesn't go to play dates, sleepovers, birthday parties,' she said. 'He will not have the childhood he deserves because you annihilated my trust.' The nine-year-old is now 'a very lonely little boy' who's confused as to why he can't see his friends outside supervised school time. One victim has nightmares and becomes angry, confused and terrified when he hears Harden's name and when meeting new people, especially men. He regularly says: 'But I trusted him, he told me it was OK, why did he do it?'. One parent lamented at having to explain to their child that abuse material about him was on the internet. Harden, who had a positive and loving upbringing, said he was abused by a family friend when he was aged 10 but he didn't believe that had any bearing on his own offending. He said he was not attracted to 'all boys' but rather ones who were fun-natured and innocent. 'Obviously I knew it was wrong,' he said of his offending. He also said the impact statements made him realise the full ramifications of what he had done and words could not explain 'how sorry I am'. The judge noted he was willing to take part in psychological and biological treatment - including anti-libido medication - to address his pedophilic disorder. She found he poses a moderate risk of re-offending and said she was guarded about his rehabilitation.", "d718816f23e3f4cb86a40b92e9deb2582043d5942f33e5da2fe9bf86": "The streets of downtown Chicago descended into chaos on Wednesday evening as hordes of teens and juveniles flooded the streets in a flash-party organized on social media.   Alderman Michele Smith, of Chicago's 43rd ward, said in a statement that about 400 individuals - mostly consisting of juveniles and young adults - took over the streets in the vicinity of North Avenue Beach. 'This promoted event was un-permitted by the City and the Park District,' Smith said in a statement on Thursday, 'Police received advance warning of the event and placed extensive resources at every entrance to the beach, including the pedestrian bridge.'  Footage from the night shows rowdy youths running through the streets of Chicago, dancing and even climbing on top of cars and public transit buses.  At one point the mayhem reached within a block of Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker's mansion, prompting police to block off the area with snow plows. The night was organized through a digital-brochure that was circulated on social media. The brochure is titled 'North Ave Beach Takeover,' and advertises a 'drinking contest,' 'twerking contest,' 'boxing gloves,' and a 'camera man in attendance.' It is unclear whether any of those events occurred. According to the brochure, the event was organized by 'Reddy Ent' and 'Teambreezy.' Reddy Ent is a self described 'party entertainment service,' according to its Instagram.  Chicago police confiscated a 'significant amount' of alcohol over the course of the night, but that the event was ended safely.  'No one was hurt, and very few arrests were necessary,' Smith said. She added that the attendees ranged between 14 and 21 years old. 'Police responded to a crowd of youths which were dispersed from the beach and monitored as they left the area,' Chicago PD told Fox News Digital, 'one arrest [was made] for open alcohol on the public way.'   Former CEO of Chicago Public Schools and budget director of the city, Paul Vallas, posted a video from the night on Twitter and decried the scenes of 'absolute chaos.' 'Tonight downtown is in absolute chaos. Juveniles jumping on top of buses, cars, terrorizing residents, tourists & businesses,' he wrote in the post. 'These mass groups fought CPD & only minimal arrests were made. Why? Because CPD isn't allowed to, they have no plan & they didn't have enough manpower.' At the end of April, Chicago PD said that there had been 556 carjackings in 2022, and that 56% percent of them had been committed by youths, according to Fox 32 Chicago. In an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune on May 9, Vallas blamed Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Police Chief David Brown's 'closure of the city's Juvenile Intervention and Support Center' for the staggering rise in juvenile crime. 'Because juveniles have been so heavily involved in recent lawlessness, procedures for managing young arrestees could also use some reform,' Vallas wrote.", "5f57f20e87476ac2b5ae82691e435243f2af495ba45b0d94b175880a": "The brother of Comanchero boss Tarek Zahed who died in a gangland hit at Bodyfit Gym has been laid to rest under the watchful eye of police as a brutal gangland war grips Sydney. Heavily-tattooed mourners gathered in drizzling rain at Rookwood Cemetery, in Sydney, on Friday to farewell 39-year-old Omar Zahed - the 12th underworld execution in just 18 months.  Omar died in a hail of at least 20 bullets aimed at himself and older brother Tarek, 41, as they left  the gym in Auburn, in Sydney's west, on Tuesday night. He died at the scene while fellow gymgoers hid behind treadmills and other equipment. His brother, Tarek, was rushed to hospital, where he continues to fight for his life.    Following a service inside the prayer room at Lakemba mosque, Omar's body arrived at the grave just after 11am inside a green coffin draped with a tapestry inscribed with Arabic script. Mourners, some wearing balaclavas, arrived at the gravesite and embraced Muslim friends and family of the slain man. Among them was underworld identity, Ahmed Elomar, the brother of ISIS terrorist Mohamed Elomar.   Elomar told Daily Mail Australia that Omar's fatal shooting was evidence of the 'shocking state of affairs for young Muslim men in Sydney'. 'This generation is all over the place,' he said. 'What happened, who knows?'.   Mr Elomar said he had been a good friend of Omar who he had known in and out of jail. A former champion boxer, Elomar served three years in prison for assaulting a policeman at the infamous 2021 pro-Islamic State riots in Hyde Park. At 11.15am, the back of the hearse was opened and an imam began conducting prayers among the male mourners while the women were held back. Two minutes later, his coffin was removed from the hearse by eight male pal bearers to a freshly dug grave. Omar's body was removed from the coffin, which was inscribed in Arabic with the words 'every soul shall taste death' - as further prayers were uttered by the sombre-faced attendees. A mourner, who did not want to be identified, told Daily Mail Australia that Tarek was 'out of a coma, but still not talking'. Tarek has undergone surgery to remove ten rounds from his head and body in Sydney's Westmead hospital, where he remains in a serious but stable condition.  Police are investigating whether the brazen gangland hit may have been an inside job sparked by an internal power struggle within the Comanchero.   Police had warned the brothers as recently as Thursday last week that their lives were at risk, however their advice went unheeded.  Homicide Squad Commander Detective Superintendent Danny Doherty said police are investigating possible motives for the assassination attempt, refusing to rule out the possibility of an inside job. 'We can't discount an internal conflict,' he told reporters.  'There is opportunities for people to take their place and there's a real power struggle within organised crime organisations.' A second line of inquiry is whether there is any connection to the shooting death of Mahmoud 'Brownie' Ahmad almost two weeks ago. NSW Police Commissioner Karen Webb noted Tarek had a target on his back due to his senior role within underworld crime networks. 'He's a senior member of the Comancheros... Australia's largest criminal organisation,' she said. A police source earlier confirmed the hit on Tarek was considered the 'biggest of the year' in the criminal world.  'Whoever has done this is game to go toe-to-toe with the Comancheros and nobody does that,' they said. Raptor Squad - a taskforce of specialist officers responsible for monitoring outlaw criminal groups in NSW - will receive a boost of 30 new officers, taking the team to 145, to help fight organised crime.  Commissioner Webb said there will be a targeted, intelligence based operation to combat increasing crime rates. 'We're not targeting mums and dads,' she said twice. 'It's a small number of people causing fear and we know who they are.' She insisted police had 'not lost control' of the crime networks and vowed to stop at nothing to ensure the community continues to feel safe and protected.  Commissioner Webb noted Tarek was warned just last Thursday about a legitimate threat to his life and was told to leave NSW as soon as possible. 'He went about his usual business, his normal routine.' Police sources claim the Comanchero are in bed with the Alameddine crime family and help to supply the network. By extension, the Alameddines rivals the Hamzy family are considered enemies of the Comancheros. But the Hamzy network is in a world of pain itself as top members have been 'picked off like flies' in recent months. Detectives and forensic investigators remained at the scene of the crime on Wednesday morning, collecting bags of evidence and examining the surrounds. A Volkswagon GTI sport model remains parked in the cordoned off area of the complex, while more detectives are at a second site several blocks away, believed to be where a burnt out luxury getaway car was found. Bullet holes riddle the entrance of the gym, which is closed for business while the investigation is underway. Police confirmed there are two other crime scenes - one in Berala and another in Greenacre - which are subject to investigations.

Addressing the media at a manufacturing site in inner-Melbourne, Mr Morrison agreed he hadn't got everything right but went further, saying he'd change aspects of his prime ministership if re-elected. 'What Australians have needed from me going through this pandemic has been strength and resilience. Now, I admit that hasn't enabled Australians to see a lot of other gears in the way I work,' he said on Friday. 'I know Australians know that I can be a bit of a bulldozer when it comes to issues. I know there are things that are going to have to change with the way I do things because we are moving into a different time.' Mr Morrison's preferred prime minister status peaked in February 2021 at 61 per cent and is now at 44 per cent, according to Newspoll. He has been avoiding inner-Melbourne and inner-Sydney seats held by moderate Liberals facing challenges from strong, climate-focused, pro-integrity independents where he's personally unpopular. Focus groups have revealed part of his unpopularity stems from his refusal to take responsibility, always going on the attack and three more years would result in 'more of the same'. Coalition members have continually run the line that the election isn't a 'popularity contest'. 'This is actually a contest around whose best place to be able to manage the economy to make sure it's strong,' campaign spokeswoman Anne Ruston told the ABC on Friday when asked about Mr Morrison's popularity. '(It's) a very choice between a very strong prime minister with a very strong plan. ... as opposed to (Anthony Albanese) who clearly doesn't understand the policies that have been put out there by his own party.' Labor continues to argue Mr Morrison is someone who doesn't accept responsibility and always seeks to blame others. Opposition frontbencher Tanya Plibersek was direct when asked if Mr Morrison's standing was hampering the Liberals' electoral chances. 'This is one of the most important choices Australians have faced in many years,' she said. 'Between a leader, Anthony Albanese - who's prepared to turn up take responsibility, show leadership, who's got a plan for the future - and Scott Morrison who has only ever got excuses.' The prime minister was in Melbourne on Friday promising to secure modern manufacturing and supply chains in Australia. A $324 million pledge will safeguard Australia's supply chains seen as key to prosperity, resilience and national security. It includes $15 million for a monitoring support mechanism to help predict future shocks to the system. The CSIRO will be funded $4 million to enhance its transport network tool, which models domestic supply chains in Australia. In addition, a $53 million investment will go towards building an animal health vaccine research and manufacturing facility. Mr Albanese is in Cairns, in the seat of Leichhardt, to announce extra funding to save the Great Barrier Reef. The opposition leader addressed Mr Morrison's comments in his press conference.   'Scott Morrison has today said he's a bulldozer. That is, a bulldozer wrecks things. A bulldozer knocks things over,' Mr Albanese said.  'I'm a builder, that's what I am. If I'm elected prime minister, I will build things in this country.  'I find it quite extraordinary. This Government had been there for almost a decade, this Prime Minister has four years in office, and what he's saying is, 'If you vote for Scott Morrison, I'll change.'  'Well, if you want change, change the government...  Because we can't just have three more years of the same.' The election will be held on May 21.", "d2d8169f35b0dd713f43d1242358f0c944f7e0845c5f912c9acfe386": "An ex-teacher, Natasha Fyles, will be the Northern Territory's next chief minister following Michael Gunner's surprise resignation earlier in the week. Ms Fyles was selected by Labor's 14-member caucus on Friday following days of behind-the-scenes wrangling between the party's left and right factions. 'This morning the caucus has selected me as the unanimous choice for leader of the Territory Labor Party,' Ms Fyles said in a statement. She will be sworn in as chief minister by the territory's administrator later on Friday. Ms Fyles, from the left faction, is the second woman to be appointed chief minister and the third to lead Territory Labor. She is also the second of the NT's 12 chief ministers to be born in the territory since the Legislative Assembly's first election in 1974. No one publicly nominated for the top job but it was expected to go Mr Gunner's right-aligned deputy, Nicole Manison. Ex-health minister Ms Fyles, 43, was viewed as her likely deputy. Former union boss and AFL player Joel Bowden is also understood to have expressed an interest in the top job from the back bench but his left-faction challenge faded on Thursday. Mr Gunner, 46, stood down on Tuesday moments after handing down the NT budget, saying his head and heart were no longer in the job. Mr Gunner cited a heart attack in 2020, the pandemic, and the birth of his second son as key reasons for leaving the NT top job, saying he was tired. 'I can no longer keep looking Territorians in the eye and say 'I can keep giving 100 per cent every day', and if I can't do that I shouldn't be in the chair.' he told reporters on Tuesday.  'When I held Nash for the first time, that was it, game over.

The worker was stood down from his position at the retailer on the Gold Coast after the car parts franchise conducted a review into the incident. He has now taken a new job with local rivals Autobarn Burleigh Heads. In the video, the woman was stopped over the contents of her pram - where she was apparently hiding three stolen items.   On Friday, the franchise issued a statement revealing the man who tried to stop the alleged thief has since decided to leave the company. His departure came not long after Daily Mail Australia revealed he had been bombarded with job offers and was 'struggling' with his newfound fame. 'I can confirm that the team member involved in the incident has decided to leave the business,' a Supercheap Auto spokesman said in a statement.  'We are continuing to offer support for the team member.'  The statement said a 'comprehensive review' had been conducted into the incident - which occurred in April. It's understood the incident was reported to Queensland Police.  Supercheap Auto reiterated the company's policy that staff should not confront suspected shoplifters. 'These policies and standards, which prohibit confronting suspected shoplifters and physical contact with customers, are designed to protect our team members and customers,' the spokesman said.  'We have extensive video surveillance in our stores and suspected cases of shoplifting are referred to the police with footage of the alleged offenders. 'The health, safety and wellbeing of our team members and customers is our highest priority and we are committed to maintaining a safe working and shopping environment. 'Our standards on health and safety are not just words on a page. They are central to the way we operate our business.' The employee will be paid out in full following the incident.  Meanwhile, staff at Supercheap Auto have been emailed by managing director Benjamin Ward reminding them about 'the company's policies and standards on interacting with customers'. Michael Farrar, who owns Autobarn in nearby Burleigh Heads, said the still-unnamed Supercheap Auto worker contacted him after he publicly offered him a job.  Mr Farrar said the worker admitted he has been 'struggling mentally' amid the turmoil with his employer and accidental internet fame.  Mr Farrar said he offered the man the position after being impressed by how he handled the situation. He told the Gold Coast Bulletin: 'He didn't like how it all went down, but it'll be all good from now on. He starts next week, next Tuesday.' Mr Farrar said his business had lost around $15,000 worth of goods over the past two years due to thieves. 'His actions showed to me that he is a loyal person and someone we would want on our team,' Mr Farrar said previously.  Dozens of people were threating to boycott the Supercheap Autos chain over the 'woke' decision. 'After watching the video it's crazy that Supercheap have stood him down after the commitment to them he demonstrated!'  Video shows the worker stopping the woman outside Supercheap Auto in Ashmore, on the Gold Coast, after she allegedly tried to flee with items stashed in the pram. The video posted online last month showed the woman tightly gripping her decoy pram, pretending there was a baby inside, as she bickered with the employee.  The employee threatened to 'call the cops' if she didn't return the allegedly stolen items as the woman tried to move the stroller out of his reach. 'Let my baby go,' she screamed as the man took hold of its handles and looked inside. 'You haven't even got a baby in there,' the man calmly replied. 'Don't touch my baby,' the woman screamed again as the employee noticed a box stowed inside the pram that was covered with a blanket. 'Oh there's a box in there!' the man cries in mock surprise. The woman then seemingly gave up on her ploy and told the retail worker he could have 'the f**king motor'. She pushed a large cardboard box out of the pram and onto the pavement for the man to collect before finally calling him a 'f**khead'. A second video later posted online showed the woman barging him out of the way and storming off down the carpark, away from the automotive supplies store. Queensland Police said detectives were unaware of any complaints made about the incident. The alleged thief then fled.

Shanazia Williamson and her husband Jarawd Owens of Dayton, Ohio, say they were expecting a child when they attended the Astroworld Festival on November 5, 2021. They say they lost the fetus due to injuries Williamson sustained at the festival.  10 people were killed during the crowd-crush at the Astroworld music festival in Houston, Texas, last November, and nearly 5,000 say they were injured. Reports say Scott continued performing despite warnings that the crowd was in danger.  In December, Williamson and Owens filed suit against Scott, festival promoters Live Nation and ScoreMore, the security companies Valle Services SMG and ASM Global, and the Harris County Sports and Convention corporation.   'While in attendance at the festival, Shanazia was trampled and crushed resulting in horrific injuries and ultimately the death of her and Jarawd's unborn child,' the suit claims, 'In addition, Shanazia sustained injuries to her shoulder, back, leg, chest, stomach and other parts of her body.' 'Defendants' failure to plan, design, manage, operate, staff, and supervise the event was a direct and proximate cause of Shanazia's injuries and death of her and Jarawd's unborn child,' the suit states.  The suit also alleges the defendants did not provide adequate security or medical personnel, and that they failed to recognize the hazards of the event's setup.  Attorneys for Williamson and Owens, Jason Itkin and Kurt Arnold, have declined to comment on the suit, according to Rolling Stone, citing a February gag order that limits what attorneys can say publicly about Astroworld lawsuits. Williamson and Owens' lawsuit is one of hundreds filed against Scott and companies involved in the festival. Scott, his label Cactus Jack, Live Nation, ScoreMore, Apple, the festival's security companies, and the venue itself face billions of dollars in damages from people injured at the festival.   A document filed in Harris County, Texas, on Monday showed that over 700 people who are suing over the festival suffered injuries that needed 'extensive' medical treatment. More than 4,900 reported they suffered some kind injury at the festival. Live Nation and the primary security company at the festival, Contemporary Services Corporation, have denied all allegations against them.  Scott himself has continually denied any responsibly for the tragedy at Astroworld. He performed onstage for the first time since the tragedy at a concert in Miami last weekend. He is scheduled to perform at the Billboard music awards ceremony this Sunday.  A representative for Scott declined to comment when contacted by DailyMail.com.", "aba366f21dce942e1208ae90392142e4e14d4535268db0a27e8413f8": "A music producer dressed as North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un gatecrashed a campaign event held by Scott Morrison. The prime minister had been holding a press conference with MP Gladys Liu at Extel Technologies manufacturing facility in Mount Waverley, Melbourne, on Friday. He then left the facility before the music producer, who goes by the name of Howard X, walked onto the scene dressed as Kim Jong-Un.   'Kim Jong-un', dressed in a pin-striped button up outfit and sporting a pair of glasses, then addressed reporters.  He accused Liberal MP Gladys Liu of being a communist before saying he supported the Liberal candidate for Chisholm.  'If you want the Chinese Communist Party to be in control of Australia, vote Liberal,' he said.  Reporters and camera crews huddled around the impersonator as he declared himself the Supreme Leader.  One person tried to confront Howard X and tell him to leave before labelling the stunt the 'most offensive thing I have ever seen in a campaign'.  'Don't tell the Supreme Leader what to do,' the impersonator responded. 'I support Gladys Liu.'  The music producer was repeatedly asked by reporters for his proper name. 'Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-Un,' he replied.  One reporter remained determined to get the true identity of the impersonator and continued to badger him with questions. 'Sir, that's not good enough,' he said. 'Just tell us who you are.' Howard X kept up the act before turning the tables on the reporter. 'Who are you? Okay, tell me your family, where they live, and their routes to work,' he said. His jibe drew laughter from the reporters who continued to film the stunt.  Police were later called to the scene and officers were spotted speaking with the impersonator.  Queensland anti-China activist and senate candidate Drew Pavlou later took to Twitter to praise Howard X.  'This is actually one of the best things we've ever managed,' he posted. 'Love you Howard you beautiful genius.'  Howard X is an Australian-Hong Kong Chinese music producer and political satirist. The music producer has regularly posed as the North Korean leader and impersonated him at the South Korea Winter Olympics in 2018. The latest stunt came after Mr Morrison was pressed by reporters whether his tough stance against China had cost him Australian-Chinese voters. 'I talk about the assertive and aggressive nature of the Chinese government,' he said. 'Not the Chinese people. Chinese Australians are the greatest patriots you could hope for in this country. I'm proud of what they have done for our country. 'That's why I draw a sharp and distinct line between the actions of an authoritarian government that is seeking to be coercive against Australia and to interfere in our region, and the wonderful Chinese people.' Ms Liu swooped in to defend her party's hardline stance against China. 'I can tell you when you talk to Chinese people in Australia, you don't start by asking whether they are holding a Chinese passport, visiting this place, or come to help their children look after children,' she said. 'I have seen a lot of people throughout my three years as a member of parliament at citizenship ceremonies. And I hear them pledge loyalty to Australia. 'So if anyone suggests that Chinese Australians are any different from all other Australians, whether you are born here or not, I think this is offensive, divisive.'", "f2954c908bdca43e1b04505d4a6ef7d83307b528d63ba1e397ae7125": "Firefighters are battling a major inferno in Melbourne's west, with flames reaching three storeys into the air.

Ariel Robinson, 30, of Greenville, South Carolina, was found guilty after jurors deliberated for an hour and a half following a four-day trial.  Robinson and her husband Jerry, 35, were arrested in 2021 after the death of their three-year-old foster daughter, Victoria Rose Smith. In April Jared pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting homicide by child abuse.   Police found Victoria unresponsive after responding to a 9-11 call at the Robinson's house on January 14, 2021. Robinson claimed at the time that the toddler 'went limp' after ingesting an excess of liquids, and that she thought the girl had choked. When asked about other bruises found all over the toddler's body, Ariel allegedly blamed Victoria's brother, who the Robinsons also fostered and claimed had 'anger issues'. Prosecutors argued that Robinson had in fact fatally beaten Victoria that night.  Greenville County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Ward testified on Wednesday that the child was beaten so severely that her blood vessels burst. He said that the blood that subsequently collected in her muscles and body fat may have killed her.  'If we lose enough blood, the heart doesn't have enough volume to pump,' Ward said.  Jerry Robinson later told authorities that the fatal beating was spurned by an incident the day before, when Victoria vomited on the way to church and angered Ariel.  Two witnesses, Jean Smith and Avery Santiago, testified on Wednesday that they saw Ariel washing Victoria's dress in the church bathroom that day. Asking if the child was sick, Robinson told Smith '[The girl] eats too much and makes herself throw up. [It'] a game.' Santiago testified that she heard Ariel telling Victoria 'Oh, you're cold. You're cold. Girls that make themselves throw up deserve to be cold,' FOX Carolina reported. 'I was frustrated,' Ariel testified on Thursday when asked about the incident at the church.  It was not the first time Ariel had lost her temper over Victoria's eating habits, according to Jerry, who testified that his wife would beat the child with a wooden paddle or a belt. 'Sometimes I'd take a piece of [her] food just to help her out,' he testified. Ariel teared up talking about Victoria on the stand on Thursday, describing her as 'a perfect child.'  'We had a good relationship,' Ariel said, according to FOX Carolina's Maya Ruiz, 'She was my mini-me.'  Ruiz reported that Robinson said 'he's lying,' when asked about her husband's statements.  Before her homicide arrest, Ariel was known for winning season 20 of the Food Network show 'Worst Cooks in America' in 2020, and receiving a $25,000 cash prize.  She and her husband Jerry have two children of their own, and began fostering Victoria and her two brothers, aged five and seven, in 2020.  Victoria's biological great aunt, Michelle Urps, blames social workers for not paying proper attention to the situation.  She says she noticed possible bruises and markings on Victoria's body in pictures Ariel had uploaded to social media.  'I knew something was wrong by looking at her social media so why couldn't they?' Urps told DailyMail.com last year.    'You have to question, do these case workers have the right training? Is the screening process adequate? Are they looking in the right places?' she said.  Urps started a petition on the Change.org website calling on state lawmakers to pass a bill called 'Victoria's Law' which would reform the South Carolina Department of Social Services.

Zucker was seen exiting his Upper East Side apartment before heading to a Chase Bank ATM. From there he strolled a block and walked in the front door of a building, where he could be seen talking to the front desk.  Zucker looked comfortable, sporting a blue quarter-zip over a white t-shirt, blue jeans, and his signature round-framed eyeglasses.  Zucker has been elusive since his resignation from CNN on February 2, where he had been president since 2013.  He left the $6million-a-year post after admitting to employees that he violated the company's Standards of Business Conduct when he failed to disclose a 'consensual relationship' with Allison Gollust, 49, the executive vice president and chief marketing officer of the network. In his resignation announcement he acknowledged he was 'wrong' to not disclose the relationship when it began. On February 3, Rolling Stone reported that during the pandemic Gollust and Zucker both gave New York governor Andrew Cuomo talking points and advice on how to deal with President Trump's criticisms of him.  Soon after, an investigation found that Gollust had also mislead CNN executives about her relationship with Zucker. Gollust resigned on February 15.  Zucker and Gollust, 49, had worked together for 20 years. They claim their relationship turned romantic during the pandemic but others say it far predates COVID.  Media sources have said the affair was an 'open secret' for more than 10 years - claiming even the doormen at their Manhattan apartment building tried to keep Allison and Zucker's now ex-wife from interacting.  Zucker and Gollust lived in the same apartment building on the Upper East Side with their respective families until Jeff sold his in 2020, after he and his ex-wife Caryn Nathanson split.  Zucker and his wife split in 2018, and Gollust is understood to have separated from her husband, Billy Hult, around the same time, if not earlier. Zucker resided in apartment 3W, while Gollust lived in the unit right above him. Their secret relationship emerged when Zucker was interviewed as part of an investigation into ousted CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who was fired as a primetime host in December.  Cuomo was sacked for advising his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, through accusations of sexual harassment.  It has since emerged that Cuomo was the one who raised Zucker and Gollusts' affair to executives.  Cuomo's attorneys are said to have told Jason Kilar, the CEO of WarnerMedia - which is CNN's parent company. He then informed AT&T boss John Stankey. Brian Stelter, the host of CNN's 'Reliable Sources,' said on the show in February that everyone at the media company was 'lawyered up' following the ousting of Zucker, Gollust, and Cuomo. Turmoil has continued to rock CNN, culminating in the catastrophic cancelling of the network's $300 million streaming service, CNN+, after just three weeks in April. During his tenure at CNN, Zucker had negotiated pumping $1billion into CNN+ over four years. A critic on Twitter aptly declared the fiasco 'the biggest flop in the history of broadcasting.'    The $300million startup service was unveiled to huge fanfare - and a glitzy New York City launch party - but drew in a pathetic 150,000 subscribers. It was previously reported executives thought its growth rate could have competed with the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post at up to 2.9million. Critics mocked CNN for shutting down the streaming service so quickly, with one asking: 'Wait... there was a CNN+?' Donald Trump released a statement 'congratulating' CNN for 'their decision to immediately FOLD for a lack of ratings, or viewers in any way, shape, or form'. CNN's new president, Chris Licht, took up the post in early May and pledged to dedicate the network to 'truth.'  'Too many people have lost trust in the news media,' he said in a statement to CNN employees, 'I think we can be a beacon in regaining that trust by being an organization that exemplifies the best characteristics of journalism: fearlessly speaking truth to power, challenging the status quo, questioning 'group-think, and educating viewers and readers with straightforward facts and insightful commentary, while always being respectful of differing viewpoints.' Licht said. 'First and foremost, we should, and we will be advocates for the truth.'", "80ddf42ec74a0264fde72069b0e9e85b407233a3b8ee0cac5c26d8f8": "A high-ranking Twitter staffer who was fired while on paternity leave says he's 'disappointed' but hopes that Twitter's 'best days are still ahead of it' as Elon Musk finalizes his $44 billion takeover. Head of consumer product Kayvon Beykpour was fired on Thursday as Musk cracks the whip following his purchase of the social media giant. 'The truth is that this isn't how and when I imagined leaving Twitter, and this wasn't my decision. [CEO] Parag [Agrawal] asked me to leave after letting me know that he wants to take the team in a different direction,' Beykpour said. The Stanford graduate - who joined the company in 2015 - said little about Musk's plans for the future. He praised his team for their work on new products and safety controls as worried workers wonder if Musk will roll back the site's extensive content moderation apparatus. 'I'm proud that we changed the perception around Twitter's pace of innovation, and proud that we shifted the culture internally to make bigger bets, move faster, and eliminate sacred cows,' said the ousted Iranian-American tech executive.  General manager for revenue Bruce Falck has also been unceremoniously axed after the billionaire's buyout. 'While I'm disappointed, I take solace in a few things: I am INSANELY proud of what our collective team achieved over the last few years, and my own contribution to this journey,' Beykpour wrote in a Twitter thread on Thursday. He touted the growth in the company's daily active users, which he says has climbed by 87 percent since the second quarter of 2018. He joined the company in 2015 after selling them his video streaming platform Periscope. He graduated from Stanford University in 2010. Beykpour said he was especially proud of Twitter's work on Spaces, Communities, Topics, creator tools, and safety controls. 'To the hard working (current and former) Tweeps out there who made all this happen: Thank you for pouring your heart and soul into this place. 'I hope and expect that Twitter's best days are still ahead of it. Twitter is one of the most important, unique and impactful products in the world. With the right nurturing and stewardship, that impact will only grow,' he said. Beykpour, who founded Periscope, admitted on his account he had not wanted to go but was brutally ousted by CEO Parag Agrawal while he was on paternity leave so they could 'take the team in a new direction'. A leaked memo from the under-fire Twitter chief to staff noted how the tech giant needed the 'right leaders at the right time'. He announced interim GM of consumer product Jay Sullivan will take over Beypour and Falck's jobs in a new merged role. It comes as the social media firm launches a tsunami of cuts by stamping down on contractor spending, travel and events, marketing and real estate. Agrawal also revealed all hiring would be frozen as the company goes through a rocky transition period before Musk takes control. The Tesla magnate's deal is being probed by US regulators after he delayed reporting the buy, meaning he failed to provide sufficient warning a takeover bid was looming.  Kayvon Beykpour Twitter's general manager said in his bio that his job was 'leading design, research, product, engineering & customer service/operations teams.' He's being replaced by Jay Sullivan, who was performing his job on an interim basis while Beykpour was on paternity leave. Beykpour previously was a co-founder of the streaming app Periscope. Bruce Falck Bruce Falck worked as the general manager of revenue and head of product for its business side. Sullivan will also take over his duties. He had been with the company since 2017. Neither appeared to tweet in the wake of Musk's takeover announcement, while Falck tweeted his appreciation for the CEO who would fire him a month later back in April.   Agrawal said Sullivan's 'product vision, ability to inspire, move quickly and drive change is what Twitter needs now, and in the future.' He said inflation, the war in Ukraine and other factors had affected the market, in addition to Musk's potential acquisition. 'In order to responsibly manage the organization as we sharpen our roadmaps and our work, we need to continue to be intentional about our teams, hiring and costs,' he wrote. Things have been chaotic at Twitter since the company announced it was going to sell to Tesla CEO Elon Musk for $44billion. Musk is set to cancel a $6.25billion loan to help with the buyout linked to his Tesla shares, now having the equity and preferred financing for the buyout, according to Bloomberg Law. Employees have lashed out in recent weeks moaning about Musk's purchase of their employer, with many claiming that the entrepreneur's hardcore defense of free speech is 'harmful.' The deal is likely to be completed within the next six months, and has sparked widespread speculation Musk is planning a cull of 1,000 existing Twitter staff to boost profits.  Within the next three years, Musk anticipates making thousands of new hires, swelling the ranks to around 11,000 employees, up from 7,500 currently. Much of the new talent is likely to be in the field of engineering.  Numbers at the company would fluctuate rising to 9,225 employees this year before falling to 8,332 in 2023. Then adding a further 2,700 workers by 2025. On a company level, Musk has previously floated the idea of closing down the San Francisco headquarters in order to save money and that board members may also not receive a salary, shaving off another $3 million in expenses. Elon Musk's purchase of the largest individually-held stake in Twitter is being investigated by U.S. regulators after he delayed reporting the buy - and thus failed to provide sufficient warning that a takeover bid was looming. The investigation, currently in its early stages, could provoke a firestorm between the mercurial entrepreneur and the financial regulators, just as Musk is trying to wrap up his purchase of Twitter, approved on April 26. It also comes amid frenzied speculation about what the world's richest man will do to Twitter once he takes the reins.  On Tuesday, he said he would allow Donald Trump back on Twitter, in line with his previous declarations that he planned to err on the side of free speech rather than bans and censorship. On Wednesday, Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and former CEO, also denied recent speculation that he had been brought back to head the Musk-owned company. With the deal to take Twitter private expected to take two to three months to finalize, speculation is mounting as to what Musk will do. The 50-year-old's first move towards buying Twitter was his purchase of a 9.2 percent stake in the tech company in mid February.  He has mooted turning the vast HQ into a homeless shelter in the vagrant and crime-plagued city, although it remains unclear whether Musk was joking.   The changes Musk makes are part of his plan to increase Twitter's annual revenue by five times current levels to $26.4 billion by 2028, up from $5 billion last year. Advertising on the platform is set to fall to 45% of total revenue under Musk, down from about 90% in 2020. By 2028, he plans for ads to generate $12 billion in revenue in 2028, while subscriptions are expected to pull in another $10 billion, according to the report.  Musk is said to favor a subscription-based model over advertiser funding, as it would make Twitter less beholden to advertiser pressure.  He has even suggested users could pay with cryptocurrency, including joke currency Dogecoin which Musk has long had an affection for.  Other revenue would come from businesses such as data licensing.  Musk has also tweeted about potentially monetizing tweets, although he has not provided specific details.  Musk also plans to see Twitter's cash flow rise to $3.2 billion in 2025 and $9.4 billion in 2028. Musk clinched a deal in April to buy Twitter for $44 billion in cash, in a move that will shift control of the social media platform populated by millions of users and global leaders to the Tesla chief. The billionaire has promised to revitalize the company and expand the number of users by cracking down on spam bots and reducing the amount of moderation to facilitate more free speech. Twitter has been condemned on banning conservative material it deems 'harmful,' including the verified contents of Hunter Biden's laptop.   After the closure of the deal, Musk is expected to become Twitter's temporary CEO it was revealed on Thursday. Among his other goals, Musk expects the social media company to bring in $15 million from a payments business in 2023 that will grow to about $1.3 billion by 2028. As one of the founders of PayPal, Musk is familiar with the world of digital payments. Twitter's payments business today, which includes tipping and shopping, is negligible.  It's believed Musk may also want to introduce payment abilities to Twitter. Musk anticipates he can increase Twitter's average revenue per user to $30.22 in 2028 from $24.83 last year, it added.  Revenue from Twitter Blue, the company's premium subscription service launched last year, is expected to have 69 million users by 2025. Users currently pay $3 a month to customize their experience on the app.  Musk hopes that plans to boost Twitter's user numbers will also see more taking out subscriptions to Twitter Blue.  Musk, in a now deleted tweet last month, suggested a raft of changes to the social media giant's Twitter Blue premium subscription service, including slashing its price. Other mooted changes include blue verification checkmarks for anyone who subscribes to Twitter's premium Blue service, which costs $2.99 a month.  Twitter Blue, launched in June 2021, is said to offer 'exclusive access to premium features' on a monthly subscription basis, Twitter says. It is available in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  'Price should probably be ~$2/month, but paid 12 months up front; account doesn't get checkmark for 60 days (watch for credit card chargebacks) &amp; suspended with no refund if used for scam/spam,' Musk said in a tweet from last month. 'And no ads,' Musk suggested. 'The power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive.' Musk also proposed an option to pay with dogecoin and asked Twitter users for their views. On Thursday, Musk listed a group of high-profile investors who are ready to provide funding of $7.14 billion for his Twitter bid, including Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Sequoia Capital. Musk has increased the financing commitment to $27.25 billion, which includes commitments from 19 investors, and reduced a margin loan from Morgan Stanley tied to his Tesla stock to $6.25 billion.  Musk, the world's richest man, is worth $255 billion - but much of that money is tied up in Tesla stock. He is believed to have 'only' $3 billion in cash, Bloomberg reported last month.   He has already secured commitments for $13 billion in loans against Twitter shares. Team, Building Twitter and serving our customers around the world is important yesterday, today, and tomorrow. Our purpose is existential. During this time of change, it's critical that we continue to strengthen our work through increased accountability and execution to make Twitter everything it can be. The priorities and decisions we make now will not only bolster how we navigate through this time, but also for the longer-term success of Twitter which I care about deeply. Some changes are happening to us and some we will drive. A number of these changes are difficult but they are right for Twitter and its future. Leadership It's critical to have the right leaders at the right time. Jay Sullivan, currently interim GM of Bluebird, has shown this powerfully. His product vision, ability to inspire, move quickly and drive change is what Twitter needs now, and in the future. I have therefore decided to make Jay the permanent GM of Bluebird. With this change, Kayvon Beykpour will be leaving Twitter. Kayvon has been an amazing leader and force at Twitter over the years with his founders mindset and deep passion for the service. Under his leadership, our product has evolved and grown meaningfully - I know I speak for all of us when I say we are deeply grateful for his tremendous impact. Over the past number of months, I have also gotten much closer to the revenue product work and believe that here too, we need to make a leadership change. Bruce Falck will be departing Twitter and we will be opening the search for a new GM of Goldbird. Bruce joined Twitter at a critical time and has been a strong collaborator, leader and supporter of the revenue product work and our purpose. Under his leadership we rebuilt our ad server and anchored the foundation for evolving our ads business to be more performance based. In the interim, the Goldbird org reports to Jay Sullivan. His leadership will be very meaningful through this transition. Please join me in thanking Kayvon and Bruce for everything they've done for Twitter. Current environment At the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, the decision was made to invest aggressively to deliver big growth in audience and revenue, and as a company we did not hit intermediate milestones that enable confidence in these goals. More recently, the global macroeconomic environment has become less favorable, the war in Ukraine has impacted our results, and may continue to do so. Many other companies have been experiencing a similar effect. And, of course, we are in the middle of an acquisition and we don't yet know the timing of the close. In order to responsibly manage the organization as we sharpen our roadmaps and our work, we need to continue to be intentional about our teams, hiring and costs. Hiring Effective this week, we are pausing most hiring and backfills, except for business critical roles as determined by Staff members in partnership with their HRBPs. We will also be reviewing all extended offers to determine criticality and those that should be pulled back. We are not planning company-wide layoffs, but leaders will continue making changes to their organizations to improve efficiencies as needed. As always, performance management will continue to be a priority at this time at all levels to ensure we have the strongest teams possible. Budgeting We also need to pull back on non-labor costs to ensure we are being responsible and efficient. We are reducing contractor and consulting spend, travel and events, marketing, our real estate footprint, on premise and public-cloud related infrastructure spend, and other operational costs. Please continue to treat Twitter's resources as you would your own, and manage tightly to your budgets, prioritizing what matters most. As promised, I will continue to communicate often and directly with all of you as we continue to move forward. Next week, will be holding a virtual offsite with our Global Leadership Team (GLT) to drive further cohesion and focus, and strengthen our collective plans to best support all of you. We will report out the outputs of that meeting to you. While we are in a ton of change right now, historically, Twitter often is. What stays true is our purpose, Twitter's importance and the criticality of our work, and how we come together. Thank you for your leadership, your focus and your support for one another. Parag (Source: The Verge)   Elon Musk's purchase of the largest individually-held stake in Twitter is being investigated by U.S. regulators after he delayed reporting the buy - and thus failed to provide sufficient warning that a takeover bid was looming. The investigation, currently in its early stages, could provoke a firestorm between the mercurial entrepreneur and the financial regulators, just as Musk is trying to wrap up his purchase of Twitter, approved on April 26. It also comes amid frenzied speculation about what the world's richest man will do to Twitter once he takes the reins.  On Tuesday, he said he would allow Donald Trump back on Twitter, in line with his previous declarations that he planned to err on the side of free speech rather than bans and censorship. On Wednesday, Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and former CEO, also denied recent speculation that he had been brought back to head the Musk-owned company. With the deal to take Twitter private expected to take two to three months to finalize, speculation is mounting as to what Musk will do. The 50-year-old's first move towards buying Twitter was his purchase of a 9.2 percent stake in the tech company in mid February. But he did not disclose his purchase to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) until at least 10 days later, on April 4. Any investor who crosses a 5 percent stake must file a form with the SEC within 10 days. It serves as an early sign to stakeholders that a big investor could seek to control the company. Musk's April 4 filing also characterized his stake as passive, meaning he did not plan to take over Twitter or influence its management or business. The next day, however, he was offered a position on Twitter's board, and a couple of weeks later, the world's richest man had clinched a $44 billion deal to buy the social media giant. The SEC investigation was first reported on Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal. Musk, known for his candid Twitter posts, has a long history of skirmishes with the SEC. Most recently, a U.S. judge slammed him for trying to escape a settlement with the SEC requiring oversight of his Tesla tweets. In April, the Information reported that the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Musk violated a law that requires companies and people to report certain large transactions to antitrust-enforcement agencies. Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November, replaced by Parag Agrawal, has been broadly supportive of Musk's moves and has been consulting with him over the direction of the company - most recently, confirming that he and Musk discussed reinstating Trump, and agreed it was the right thing to do. When musician and YouTuber Charles Wienand tweeted: I predict that @elonmusk will eventually just ask @Jack to be CEO of Twitter,' Dorsey replied: 'nah I'll never be CEO again.' Asked who should be CEO, Dorsey replied: 'no one ultimately.' Mark Milian, Bloomberg's technology editor, joked: 'What if the title is Big Bird?' 'Tempting,' replied Dorsey, and when someone suggested the job title Technoking, he replied: 'Taken'. Another asked, more seriously, whether Dorsey would like the job. 'nah. it's time to roll the dice again,' he replied.", "559cc5a0f1ce7005097beaecee672134c441b9445e3a65f59c60fa00": "A video posted online shows the moment a live streamer confronted Andy Dick in a ramshackle trailer, accusing the comedian of molesting him in his sleep after discovering a lube-like substance in his butt. Dick, 56, was arrested Wednesday morning on suspicion of sexually assaulting a man at an RV campground at O'Neill Regional Park in Orange County, Southern California where he was reportedly living with a group of live streamers.  A livestream of his arrest was shown on YouTube and footage posted to the channel 'Captain Content RV' afterwards revealed the events in the lead up, including the confrontation inside the trailer.  A young man, who goes by the name 'JJ', can be seen telling another person in the RV that he believed Dick had molested him in his sleep.  The accuser's name has not been released by police. 'I was just in bed right now, and I smelled certain parts of my body ... [I was] in the other RV with Andy, and ... the last thing I remember, we were on the phone with his fiancee ... I smelled parts of myself and they smell like artificial smells,' he says while appearing slightly disorientated.  The man said he thought there was some sort of lotion or lubricant in his butt.   'JJ' is heard in the original livestream then trying to confront Dick about the alleged incident.  Dick, who is heard saying that he's on the phone with his 'baby's mama' denies the allegation, and then is heard asking, 'Did you take my blow?'  'No, I didn't even take it whenever it was offered,' the man replies.  The man then asks Dick, 'Why did you assault me in my sleep?'  Dick denies the accusations and tries to block the camera with his foot.   'I never assaulted you in your sleep,' he responds. 'Can you leave me alone?' Another video posted online shows Orange County Sheriff's Department deputies arriving at the campground at about 11:15am local time before handcuffing dick and escorting him to a patrol car. The comedian is being held on a $25,000 bail at Orange County's Central Jail and is scheduled to be in court on Friday. Additional details of the alleged incident were not released, but deputies say the accuser was taken to a nearby hospital to be examined. Sgt. Scott Steinle confirmed to Page Six that the Special Victims Unit is involved in this situation and 'part of their investigation is to make sure that the victim is taken care of physically and that would also include a potential physical exam'. Dick was evicted from his apartment last summer and had reportedly been living with a group of livestreamers in an RV at the camp site which charges $20 a day per vehicle. His friend Elisa Jordana, 33, revealed on her YouTube show, Kermit and Friends last year that Dick had been staying at hostels and at one point stole 'cutlery, a wine glass, and plates' from a steakhouse. 'He asked for a doggie bag so he could put all that in,' she recalled, in addition to alleging he told the waitress he wanted to sleep with her. During Wednesday's arrest Dick wore a gray hoodie and black joggers as he was hauled away in handcuffs before being placed inside a patrol car. Deputies then searched Dick's trailer. No additional details were provided.   Dick's arrest on Wednesday is not the first time the controversial comedian has been in trouble with the law.  Last month, Las Vegas police conducted a welfare check at the home the comedian was staying in after a man he was with pulled a gun during an argument that was featured on a live feed, TMZ reported. In the video, one can hear Andy telling his host, 'Don't shoot the gun'.  According to the news outlet, fans of Dick were concerned and believed the actor's life was in danger, but when police arrived, Dick told them he was fine wanted to stay. Over the decades, Dick has been transparent about his alcohol and drug abuse, following a string of arrests and controversial behavior that have made news headlines. Dick, who is known for his roles in NewsRadio, Inspector Gadget and Road Trip, was dropped from two movies in 2017 - Raising Buchanan and Vampire Dad - over alleged complaints that he groped members of the production. However, no one formally came forward.  'I didn't grope anybody. I might have kissed somebody on the cheek to say goodbye and then licked them,' Dick told The Hollywood Reporter following his removal from the film.  'That's my thing--I licked Carrie Fisher at a roast. It's me being funny. I'm not trying to sexually harass people.' Dick was interviewed later that same year by TMZ who sought him out for comment regarding the string of sexual harassment scandals that rocked Hollywood in 2017.  He appeared to make light of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein and actor Kevin Spacey, saying they were probably 'just trying to get a date'.  Dick then threatened to grope the cameraman but at another point in the interview he tearfully admitted to contemplating suicide every day. In November 2021, Dick was arrested for felony domestic battery after he allegedly hit his boyfriend in the head with a liquor bottle. According to police, Dick and his boyfriend had been at his home when they got into a heated argument that quickly turned physical. When police were called, they determined there was enough evidence to arrest the comedian, as his boyfriend was allegedly bleeding from a sizable wound on his head. Dick was released after he posted $50,000 bond. In October 2021, Dick was arrested for allegedly hitting his boyfriend in the face with a frying pan. In June 2021, the actor was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon for allegedly attacking a male partner with a metal chair. Dick also made his $50,000 bail after that altercation. In 2019, the actor was sentenced to 14 days in jail after being convicted of sexual battery for allegedly squeezing a woman's rear end. He was released after a single night due to jail overcrowding.  The same year, he was seen on video being slammed to the ground after he got into a fight with an Uber Eats driver while seemingly intoxicated. He previously pleaded not guilty to one count of misdemeanor sexual battery in April 2018 after he allegedly groped an Uber driver's crotch. Dick's estranged wife Lena Sved received a domestic violence restraining order against him in 2018, which required him to move out of their home and remain 100 yards away from her and their adult children: Lucas, 33, Jacob, 27, and Meg, 24. In 2012, he was arrested for allegedly grabbing a 17-year-old girl's top and pulling it down to expose her breasts. He was later found with marijuana and pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drug and battery charges, for which he was sentenced to three years of probation. In 2010, he was arrested for allegedly grabbing a man's genitals while intoxicated at a West Virginia bar. In 2007, Dick groped Ivanka Trump during an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live and was pulled off stage by Kimmel's security staff. She was greeted by Dick, who asked Ivanka for a 'big, wet kiss' right off the bat Kimmel later told Extra. The situation spiraled with Dick rubbing his hands on Ivanka's thighs and knee while she politely tried to stop the unwanted advances. Kimmel proceeded to stop Dick from touching Ivanka before continuing the interview. Dick continued to touch Ivanka, first trying to grab at Ivanka's ponytail and then touching her arm, before security dragged him off the stage.", "99c152a9fc4695d902243aab06088f84d1a1ab33b1219b0775ae09cd": "Craig McLachlan has been portrayed in court as a powerful and angry lead actor who threw tantrums, threatened cast members and physically abused actresses. On Friday, defence barrister Michael Hodge QC took a defamation trial jury through several incidents in which McLachlan, 56, was alleged to have been furious at supervisor directions, musicians missing cues, and fellow actors changing their performances without notice. 'Do you accept that you have a temper and a tendency to get angry easily?' the barrister asked. 'No, Mr Hodge,' McLachlan replied. Mr Hodge said the actor had threatened to put music supervisor Tony Castro into hospital after having one of his songs interrupted.  Christie Whelan Browne and Tim Maddren, both Rocky Horror cast members, claim to have heard this threat. McLachlan is also accused of yelling and kicking a rubbish bin after being asked to wear a wig, and calling other cast members 'a bunch of untalented and ungrateful c****' after Maddren altered his performance during a bed scene in the 2014 stage production. The actor admitted that he collided with actress Ashlea Pike on that same night but said he couldn't remember whether she had injured her ribs and had to take several days off afterwards.  He stuck by his story that the pair merely had the wind knocked out of them. He denied grabbing Whelan Browne's face in the final scene of the show that night and pushing it aside, and said he had gone to the actress's room the following day to apologise because she was close to Maddren and was worried the two men were upset with each other. McLachlan rejected allegations by Mr Hodge that the apology was for the alleged assault the night before. Earlier on in the questioning, McLachlan admitted he may have sat on actress Erika Heynatz's lap and kissed her neck in the green room of the theatre. He claims he only did so because Heynatz would frequently 'vampire kiss' cast and audience members on their necks during and after the show. Mr Hodge suggested this was a lie to cover up why he had actually kissed Heynatz's neck. The actor is suing the ABC, Fairfax, and actress Christie Whelan Browne, 39, for defamation over publications in January 2018 relating to claims of misconduct during the 2014 production of The Rocky Horror Show and other productions. He has denied the allegations in the publications, and has accused Whelan Browne and two other women of approaching the media for notoriety or money. The NSW Supreme Court hearing continues.", "bc695653f292edd62b4f75f33f0194ddc168ecb22ba32fbf87b59b77": "Pauline Hanson has called for pedophiles to be chemically castrated along with tougher penalties for sex offenders. The One Nation leader also called for the establishment of a national database of paedophiles, after responding to questions on the issue from Daily Mail Australia.  'I support chemical castration and tougher penalties for paedophiles, and the establishment of a national database of paedophiles,' she told Daily Mail Australia.  'People are very concerned about their children's safety and they want strong laws and penalties for those convicted of paedophilia,' Ms Hanson said.  'For sex offences not involving children, I consider it appropriate for the presiding magistrate or judge to determine the appropriate penalty under the relevant law.' However, despite Ms Hanson supporting a national paedophile register, if she does decide to introduce legislation into parliament to make it happen, she may face opposition, with state politicians opposing a similar idea backed by the coalition in 2020. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton announced the federal government was putting $7.8million toward a public register of convicted sex offenders in January 2019 - just before the 2019 election in May.  Under the policy, the names, aliases, photos and nature of sex offenders' crimes would be made publicly accessible, as would their general location.  Despite the federal government making the funds available for the project to happen, it was up to state governments to introduce it in their jurisdictions.   Queensland Premier Annastasia Palasczcuk's government voted down a motion supporting such a register, in a move Mr Dutton's spokeswoman slammed as 'very frustrating'.  Queensland state Labor MP Scott Stewart rubbished the idea, telling Parliament the Australian Institute of Criminology had found 'public sex offender registers do not reduce recidivism.'  'This government will always listen to and support the experts -- unlike those opposite,' he said, crowing that his government already had the 'toughest' regime for sex offenders. Bruce Morcombe, whose son Daniel was abducted from a bus stop by a convicted paedophile in December 2003 and murdered, has urged state and territory governments to introduce a paedophile's register now. 'I don't want it to wither on the vine - I want it to grow bigger and stronger and actually be delivered'.  The Daniel Morcombe Foundation has issued its own plan for how a sex offender register could work. Such a register would publish the names, aliases, geographical area, current photo, list of identifying features of offenders, and local statistics.  Mr Morcombe said his foundation's plan was modest and would only see repeat or recidivist offenders, or people who have committed hideous crimes, named and shamed.  That would give more minor, one-off offenders a chance to get help and be rehabilitated.   Mr Morcombe has previously lashed state and territory leaders as 'weak as piss' for their lukewarm response to Mr Dutton's $7.8million proposal.  But the child protection advocate struck a more measured tone to Daily Mail Australia saying he 'hoped' it was still on the agenda. 'And if it's not, as a reasonable, level-headed citizen of Australia, please tell me why? Why am I on the wrong track. 'I see a lot of upside. It's all about kids, keeping kids safe and kids' rights to be safe all the time, that's what it's about.  'That should come before convicted multi-offending paedophiles.'  Under the Daniel Morcombe Foundation's plan, a child sex offenders' register would contain the following information: The register would NOT capture information that could assist in the identification of young victims of crime or include offenders aged under 18 years of age. Accompanying the register would be strengthened vigilante laws to protect the physical wellbeing and safety of those listed on the register.

The former Australian of the Year took to Twitter to post a screenshot of a Sydney Morning Herald interview with Deves that was published on Friday. A photo of Ms Deves was plastered across the front page and showed the Liberal candidate for Warringah smiling outside a pre-polling booth on Thursday. Ms Deves then claimed in the article that most Australians 'agree with her campaign on women's sport' before saying her comments about transgender people had been 'decontextualised' and 'misinterpreted'.  An outraged Ms Tame accused the newspaper of softening hate speech by publishing the piece on Ms Deves.  'Do better, @smh,' she tweeted. 'Katherine Deves' views on trans children aren't 'controversial'. They're absolutely false. 'Defending her 'right to speak her mind'? She is defending her right to spread disinformation and abuse, enabled by this propagandist puff piece. Stop softening hate.' Ms Deves insisted in the article that she was not transphobic and that most people sided with her opinion on transgenders competing in women's sport. She said the public backlash had taken a toll on her and shifted focus away from bigger issues like the rising cost of living, climate change and housing affordability. 'I did not expect that some tweets about a complex, nuanced argument that I'd been having before I'd even considered putting my hand up for politics were going to dominate my campaign,' she told Sydney Morning Herald. 'I wouldn't be human if I said this whole process hasn't affected me, to see it turned into what it was turned into by the press. I was distraught and it caused me distress.' Ms Deves said she could not be blamed if moderate Liberal MPs lost their seats in the upcoming federal election.  Ms Deves came under fire for transphobic comments, calling transgender people 'surgically mutilated'. While she initially apologised for the comments, earlier this week, she walked back the apology saying mutilation was the 'correct medico-legal term'. NSW Treasurer Matt Kean and North Sydney federal MP Trent Zimmerman are among the moderate Liberals who have demanded Ms Deves be disendorsed. Fears have grown that her controversial tweets could sway voters away from the Liberals and open up the seats for Independent candidates. Ms Deves has been forced to hire a bodyguard following the backlash around her tweets. 'It's really debased the electoral process -- people should be able to speak their minds and engage and put their hands up for public office without their safety or their children's safety put at risk,' she said. The Liberal candidate said she was neither conservative or moderate, but had voted for same-sex marriage. She admitted one of her daughters had begun to question gender roles and had wanted to cut her hair and play rugby league. Ms Deves said she was supportive of her children's decisions.", "7dc075f9e494b7fddc51aad1249c0069cce869e91f9fefb8e7991444": "A serial rapist appeared before a judge in the Bronx on Thursday to be arraigned on charges of raping a woman in the elevator of her apartment building, just six weeks after he was paroled following 16 years in jail.    Ramon Rotestan, 39, turned himself into cops on Thursday and was filmed being perp-walked. He later appeared before a judge, and according to the charge sheet told his victim: 'This is a robbery. Don't do anything stupid.'  Rotestan was charged with 12 counts, including rape, robbery, sexual abuse, forcible touching and burglary.Police said the suspect followed the woman into the elevator of her Bronx apartment building located in the area of Bolton Street and Lydig Avenue in Pelham Parkway  Video surveillance captured inside the elevator shows the knife-wielding suspect speaking to the victim before robbing and raping her at knifepoint.  At one point when the elevator stops at the second floor, the suspect is seen looking directly into the camera before scoping out the area to ensure they were alone, before pulling out a condom and performing the violent sex act.  The suspect robbed the woman, who appeared to hand over her wallet, of $112 before fleeing the scene. Crime on the streets of New York is at a record high with robbery up 44.5 percent, felony assaults 19 percent, rape 12 percent, and overall crimes a staggering 41.26 percent making many New Yorkers feel uneasy. After the unprovoked attack, the victim was taken to Jacobi Medical Center for treatment, The New York Post reported.    It is yet another shocking incidence of crime in the Big Apple where rape, assault and robbery have all soared.  On the same evening as the harrowing rape, New York City's party-loving Mayor Eric Adams was rubbing shoulders with celebrities at a star-studded fundraiser which included the likes of Jeff Bezos. Comedian John Mulaney, the night's host for entertainment at the Robin Hood Foundation's annual benefit gala at the Javits Center, in midtown Manhattan, ripped into Adams, 61. The Grammy-winning comic took aim at the mayor's reputation as a jet-setting party boy, joking that he traveled so much he didn't live in NYC. 'I love Mayor Adams. He's done so much good for the city that he's thinking of moving here,' Mulaney quipped.  Last week, the mayor left his crime-plagued city to hobnob with billionaires and comedians on the West Coast .  The cop-turned-politician flew to Los Angeles for a three-day jaunt in LA to drum up positive press and business for the Big Apple. During his trip, which included catching Dave Chappelle's show at the Hollywood Bowl, he was seen at a dinner at the hyper-cool, members-only San Vincente Bungalows hosted by top Hollywood agent Cade Hudson, according to Page Six. A source told Page Six that the soiree was 'to welcome the mayor to L.A.' The San Vincente Bungalows, which was started by Jeff Klein in 2019, has a 750 members comprised of what the New York Times referred to as 'apex predators' like Steven Spielberg and Netflix co-CEO, Ted Sarandos.  The annual dues costing $4,200 for members over 35; $1,800 for those younger. Screenwriter Jon Robin Baitz told the Times the decor was 'a cross between a glorious English cottage, Bugsy Siegel's hide-out and Bemelman's bar.' The club is so private that camera lenses of all cell phones are covered with a sticker when members enter, and photography is forbidden. Meanwhile, crime continues to rise across New York - despite Adams' promises to crack down on the already surging numbers under predecessor Bill de Blasio. Through May 1, overall crime is up 41 percent in New York City from the same period in 2021.  While murders are down 14 percent, robberies are up 44 percent and felony assaults are up 19 percent. In January 2022, Mayor Adams unveiled a comprehensive plan to combat the surge in crime, which included increased foot patrols as well as the revival of a plain clothes unit named Neighborhood Safety Teams. The mayor also launched his Subway Safety plan in February, which sent 1,000 officers with health care partners to crackdown on homelessness and crime in the city's transit system. Yet the initiatives have bore little fruit as crime continues to rise, with murder and rape being the only crimes to see a down tick between April 2022 and April 2021. The NYPD reported 31 murders last month, a 38 percent drop from the 50 last year, and rapes fell by 6 percent, with 109 cases reported in April. Adams' jet-setter and celebrity groupie status seems to be at odds with his image of an outer borough guy, raised by a single mom who was house cleaner. He's talked about being beaten up by police before he went on to join the NYPD and rising to the rank of captain. 'I am just a blue-collar guy scraping along,' he once told Politico. 'I'm potentially the first blue-collar mayor.' Adams has been known to attend Zero Bond, the downtown Manhattan members-only club. He's chided New Yorkers for staying in, saying the Big Apple has become 'so boring' in March. 'I want to become a city of excitement again,' he said. The mayor also took heat from political pundits for jetting out of the city too often while the city suffers through a rise in crime. He's been to Miami, Chicago, Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Los Angeles in the first few months in office. Adams sees no contradiction in stepping out at night and fighting crime in the city. He combined the two themes recently at the ultra-swank Met Gala after returning from his L.A. trip. During the red-carpet event, Adams wore a custom-made tuxedo jacket with the words 'End Gun Violence' emblazoned on the back.' 'We need to keep that in the forefront as we enjoy the financial ecosystem,' he told the New York Times. 'Several people cautioned him against doing too many trips because it will hurt,' Karen Hinton, ex-press secretary for Mayor Bill de Blasio, told NY1 News. Adams also attended a tech conference held by Milken Institute Global Conference, but back home New Yorkers worried about the increase in gun violence. While he was gone, a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University found that his approval rating had dropped three points to 43 percent with 54percent of New York City voters saying he's not doing a great job curbing crime.", "f031688a7d2106a8dd186bc3c9083abf28b679b4d80f289d0929af06": "A man alleged to have been chosen by a Melbourne gangland figure to take out two of his rivals has been identified after he was given bail. Joshua Fuller, 31, a member of the Notorious Crime Family - or 'NCF' - gang was reportedly alleged by police in Ringwood Magistrates' Court as having been contracted by jailed NCF boss George Marrogi to shoot two men.  It came after Marrogi discovered a kill contract had been taken out on his brother, Jesse Marrogi, the court heard.  The court heard that police alleged Fuller was to be paid $150,000 by George Marrogi to shoot the two men by April 24.  Jesse Marrogi is believed to have left Australia with his girlfriend Sabrine Maghnie, the daughter of murdered underworld figure Nabil Maghnie. Their whereabouts currently unknown. The allegations against Fuller by Victoria Police came to light in the Herald Sun on Friday as he was bailed on charges of failing to comply with a direction to assist police by not providing passcodes on Tuesday. Despite the police allegations aired in court, Fuller has not been charged with any offence.  Fuller had been arrested with a 27-year-old man from Mickleham on suspected conspiracy to kill, but neither man was charged with the crime. Marrogi is currently in Victoria's Barwon prison after being sentenced to 32 years imprisonment on April 29 for shooting dead drug dealer Kadir Ors outside Campbellfield Plaza on September 26, 2016. The 33-year-old must serve at least 27 years before he is eligible for parole.  Earlier this year Australian Federal Police in court accused Marrogi of continuing to run a drug syndicate while behind bars. Police allege Marrogi pretended to be speaking to his lawyer but was in fact conducting a criminal enterprise through his girlfriend, Antonietta Mannella, in coded phone calls. Marrogi was subsequently charged with importing 56kg of methamphetamine and 13kg of heroin while in jail. His girlfriend Manella also face charges of importing a commercial quantity of border-controlled drugs and is due to face court in August.  On Tuesday the court reportedly heard it was Mannella who gave Fuller $50,000 as down payment for the planned murders on behalf of Marrogi.   Fuller was then arrested at his Ringwood North home on April 5 as police seized $50,000 cash, knuckledusters and prescription drugs. Police allege Marrogi told Fuller he should 'not worry' about losing the cash and that Fuller had done 'reconnaissance' on the targets. 'One can be shot and the other can come out and they can be shot,' police allege George Marrogi told Fuller.  Fuller's bail conditions include remaining at his Ringwood North home, observing a 9pm-5am curfew, and refraining from calling or associating with Marrogi and Mannella directly or indirectly. He must also use only one phone, to which he must provide access to police.

Cindy Gambino, 50, passed away despite the best efforts of her husband and medics who tried to revive her on Tuesday.  On Father's Day 2005, Ms Gambino's ex-husband Robert Farquharson drove a car into a dam with their three boys Jai, Tyler and Bailey inside. He left them to die.  Ms Gambino's family issued a statement dubbing Gambino as a 'warrior of justice' since losing her three boys and sharing their 'sincere thanks' to all who supported her.  Ms Gambino attracted sympathy across the nation after Farquharson was convicted of the horrific triple murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole some two years after the crime. Farquharson lost two subsequent appeals.  Meanwhile, after the tragedy Ms Gambino married her 'devoted' husband, Stephen Moules, who she had more children with.  'Through unfathomable tragedy and suffering came new hope, with Cindy and Stephen going on to have two sons, Hezekiah and Isaiah,' the family's statement read.  Her death, which was completely unexpected, has brought 'deep sadness' to the 'shattered' family. On September 4, 2005, Robert Farquharson, 37, had been on a Father's Day outing with his three sons, Jai, 10, Tyler, 7 and Bailey, 2 Cindy Gambino saw her three boys alive for the last time when she dropped them over to their dad at about three o'clock that Sunday afternoon.  She had ended the marriage 10 months earlier and Farquharson had moved back in with his father.  He was returning his boys to Ms Gambino, when he veered his car off the Princes Highway and into a dam near Winchelsea, 110km south-west of Melbourne. Their car went over the gravel median, crossed the oncoming lanes, crashed through a fence and skirted a row of trees before plunging into the dam. Farquharson then left the children in the car, with the youngest Bailey strapped in a baby seat, as he swam to safety.  The father later recounted he had blacked out from a coughing fit as he was driving, causing him to swerve off the highway - waking up in the car with water up to his chest. Yet, after a six-week trial and three days of deliberations a jury found that Farquharson had driven the vehicle into the water intentionally after damning evidence was heard in court. A witness who saw Farquharson after he had emerged from the water onto the side of the highway said the father was babbling he had 'killed the kids'. Shane Atkinson had pulled over after he saw the child killer leaping on to the road and waving his arms.  The witness said the father was unwilling to call the police, and rejected his offer to go and save the kids from the dam.  Three months after the drownings police charged Farquharson with three counts of murder. An old friend of the father, Greg King, told police he had heard him talking about making his estranged wife pay for their marriage break-up by killing their children on Father's Day. He wanted to do this so Ms Gambino would remember it for the rest of her life, the court heard. He had also said he wanted revenge for getting the bad car after their separation, and for her seeing another man.  Farquharson was convicted of the horrific triple murder in 2007 and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

And a mother-of-two has revealed how she has to run a gauntlet of drug users and pools of vomit and blood whenever she picks up her children. Victoria state government officials horrified some parents when they approved the trendy drug injection centre to open next door to Richmond West Primary School. Now a catalogue of shocking incidents around the school has been revealed, including a couple appearing to have sex on the school grounds and the school being put into emergency lockdown twice within a week.  Another man was caught with drugs on school grounds, while one man tried to force his way inside the school, then circled threateningly outside after he was kicked out.  Local mum Elena Markushina admits she's terrified just taking her two sons Roman, 11, and Max, 9, to and from the school, which has since beefed up its security. 'I couldn't believe it when they said they were putting it there,' she told Daily Mail Australia.  'They are exposing primary school children who are very young and very vulnerable to this kind of thing. You don't know what they are going to see now.' She says she has to walk past the nearby car park on the way to school and it is littered with drug users injecting themselves and fighting with each other. And on the way back the paralegal and law graduate has to push past a pack of intimidating drug addicts crowding outside the injection room. Ms Markushina says the arrival of the drug injection room in 2018 has traumatised her, leaving her constantly anxious and on edge. 'My child is autistic - he doesn't always understand what is going on around him or follow instructions,' she admitted. 'It's scary. Very scary for kids. 'But I can't show any fear because they are very sensitive to that and will get upset if I'm upset. 'So I have to pretend this is all fine, this is all cool as junkies shoot up with all the needles and blood and vomit and all this crap around. 'But this is not normal. These people are shady characters, they're unpredictable.  'They make me feel very uncomfortable - they might well be nice but they look strange and I don't know what to expect from them.' She lives in fear of her children injuring themselves from discarded syringes or being attacked by a desperate junkie during their twice daily trips. 'You can't have your husband with you all the time,' she said. 'And my youngest child used to like to pick up sticks - I'm terrified he will pick up a syringe instead, 'I can't watch him every second.' The Russian-born immigrant says she now can't face returning to the local health centre attached to the drug injecting room. 'It used to be so nice and inviting and sparkling clean with a great atmosphere, but not any more,' she says. 'I'll need to be dead before I go back there now. 'There's sick on the ground, they spit on the ground, they vomit on the ground - it's very uncomfortable and stressful for me.' She says the school did not oppose the location of the injection room when it was first proposed, despite the fears of parents. But Ms Markushina insists she does not want it closed down - just moved somewhere more appropriate. 'Before it opened, we would have junkies trying to break into the laundry in our housing commission block and we would find them shooting up inside,' she said. 'That sort of thing has now stopped since the injection room opened. We want its work to continue - but just somewhere more sensible than beside a school.' Victoria Police said they had mounted high profile policing in the area and a recent three-day special operation to target drug-related crime in the area, resulting in 20 arrests for crimes ranging from heroin trafficking, armed robbery, theft and drug possession. A spokesman added: 'Any incident of criminal activity, including people exposing themselves or taking drugs in public, is a concern to Victoria Police. 'Everyone in the community deserves to go about their daily lives without being subjected to crime, especially children. 'Local police continue to work hard to disrupt drug related crime in the Richmond area.'

The Tesla CEO shared his views on US politics in a series of tweets Thursday evening. He said Trump shouldn't run for office because a 'less divisive candidate would be better in 2024,' before going on to criticize Joe Biden for thinking 'he was elected to transform the country, but actually everyone just wanted less drama.' On Tuesday, the South African mogul revealed he would reverse Trump's ban from the platform.  Trump was banned last January after public outcry surrounding the storming of the Capitol and his insistence that the 2020 election was 'stolen' from him. Musk, 50, is in the process of completing his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, once the ex-president's social media network of choice. Speaking virtually at a Financial Times conference in London on Tuesday, the SpaceX founder said that Twitter's move to ban the former US president 'was a morally bad decision and foolish in the extreme.' 'It alienated a large part of the country, and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice. He is now going to be on Truth Social,' said Musk. 'So I think this may end up being frankly worse than having a single forum where everyone can debate. I guess the answer is that I would reverse the permanent ban.'   But that doesn't mean Musk wants to see the former Celebrity Apprentice host return to the Oval Office. 'Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter,' Musk tweeted on Thursday. Trump was permanently banned from Twitter on January 8, days after his supporters stormed the Capitol and forced senators into secure rooms as they certified the election results in favor of Biden. In a statement at the time, the company cited one tweet in which Trump promised that his supporters would have a 'GIANT VOICE long into the future.' In another tweet, he clarified that he would not attend Biden's inauguration. Musk has since made it clear that he would return Trump to Twitter when his purchase is finalized. Musk said Dorsey, who was CEO until November 2021, agreed with him. 'I do agree,' Dorsey tweeted, pointing out that he supported bans for sharing content such as child sexual exploitation (CSE), but not generally.  'There are exceptions (CSE, illegal behaviour, spam or network manipulation, etc), but generally permanent bans are a failure of ours and don't work, which I wrote about here after the event (and called for a resilient social media protocol).' The former president has declined the offer in favor of his own fledgling network Truth Social, which has struggled to gain users. In a poll conducted by CNN and released in February, half of Republican and Republican-leaning independents said they would re-nominate Trump in 2024. Among those who preferred a different candidate, 21 percent went with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose highly publicized row with Disney over the so-called 'Don't Say Gay' law has mobilized conservatives in his favor.  On Thursday, Musk also tweeted: 'Biden's mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country, but actually everyone just wanted less drama.' Biden's poll numbers have struggled as inflation, caused in part by the pandemic's effect on the supply chain, continues to raise prices.  A recent Morning Consult poll shows that he has a net favorability in only 10 US states. The only states where Biden isn't underwater are California, Washington, Maryland, New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, Illinois, Rhode Island, Delaware, Hawaii and the District of Columbia.  But even there, his net approval has dramatically shrunk since this time last year. Meanwhile at Twitter, staff shake-ups continue as Musk is set to take over the platform. Head of consumer product Kayvon Beykpour and general manager for revenue Bruce Falck were unceremoniously axed after the billionaire's buyout last month. Beykpour, who founded Periscope, admitted on his account he had not wanted to go but was brutally ousted by CEO Parag Agrawal while he was on paternity leave so they could 'take the team in a new direction'. A leaked memo from the under fire Twitter chief to staff noted how the tech giant needed the 'right leaders at the right time'. He announced interim GM of consumer product Jay Sullivan will take over both their jobs in a new merged role.

Janiya Shaimiracle Douglas is facing charges of fleeing and eluding police, according to the Monroe County Sheriff's Department.  Douglas, 19, was arrested on the morning of May 12 at 9:48 a.m. at 58000 Card Sound Road, Key Largo, Florida.  The sheriff's department said in a statement that Sgt. Robert Dosh noticed a Toyota Sedan speeding and driving recklessly along Card Sound Road at 7:47 a.m.  Dosh attempted to flag down the car using his lights and siren but the car continued on initially before stopping at an intersection. The statement then reads: 'The suspect stated getting arrested was on her bucket list since high school. Douglas was taken to jail.' According to the sheriff's website, Douglas  works as a housekeeper and lives in Homestead, Florida, around 20 miles from where the arrest occurred.  The Card Sound Road address is the address of Alabama Jack's beach bar, although according to the bar's opening hours, they don't open until 11:00 a.m. The saloon notes on their website that they're: 'Just about the only thing on Card Sound Road.' Florida law states that, Douglas fleeing and eluding is felony offense that carries some 'harsh penalties' that can include a license suspension of anywhere between one and five years.  Douglas is due to appear in court in Monroe County on June 14.  The Monroe County Sheriff's Office statement drew comments such as: 'At 19 is it called a bucket list? In my time that was called... GOALS, dreams, aspirations. But I guess if you're gonna drive like a fool you are rushing toward death so it may be the appropriate word after all.' In 2016, Edie Simms, 102, was arrested by cops in St. Louis as part of a bucket list request. When asked if she enjoyed the experience, Simms said: 'Oh yes, handcuffs and all,' reported KLPR at the time.", "61773f12d666c5962d8286e86dad7930df42f13b4cce5eb9b1815e2b": "Australian bodybuilder and 'Mr Universe'  Calum von Moger was beset by a series of unfortunate events before he jumped through a second-storey window. Prior to the incident, the 31-year-old was an international celebrity and three-time Mr Universe winner who inspired thousands of people to get fit and lead healthier lives. Moger, who has been living between California and his family home near Melbourne, is in a stable condition in hospital with severe spinal injures after the fall on May 6. The reason for the incident has not been released. However, it was just the latest in a string of misfortunes to arise in Moger's life. Over the past five years, the gym junkie - once dubbed Arnold Schwarzenegger 2.0 - suffered a knee and bicep injury that left him incapacitated for a year, found out he was the father of a little boy named Kairos, and his house in California burnt down. Earlier this year, he appeared in Melbourne Magistrates' Court after he allegedly rammed another car and chased the driver with a machete, before police allegedly found cannabis, ice and testosterone in his possession. He was charged with criminal affray and drug possession, was on bail and reportedly living with his brother in Melbourne while awaiting his next court mention on May 26. Moger was reportedly kicked of his family's home before he jumped out the window. But those who follow him closely online say he hasn't been the same since his bull terrier, Rex, choked to death on a chip last year. The strongman explained in a YouTube video that tragedy struck when he briefly left the house after moving to Texas in early 2021. 'I left the house for 20 minutes to go to the store and I guess he got into one of the rooms and there was a bag of chips and he choked on a chip,' Moger said.  'I came back, looked for him and found him on the floor with his head in the chip bag - I thought it was a bad joke, and then I went down and I couldn't do anything.' Moger tried giving Rex CPR, doing compressions, and raced him to the vet - but there was nothing anyone could do. He described the situation as the worst thing that has ever happened to him - including the moment he was involved in an abseiling incident and spent a year trying to recover in 2019. Just weeks earlier, his rescue dragon lizard, Baz, tragically died during a three-day power outage following heavy snowfall. Moger doesn't know why the lizard passed away because they're supposed to live for at least a decade, but he only had Baz for four years. A year prior, the gym junkie announced that he had learned he was the father of a little boy, Kairos, following a paternity test. Moger said he was excited to be part of Kairos' life, but wanted nothing to do with the boy's mother. He frequently posts pictures of the toddler on Instagram. The bodybuilder grew up in a large family with his parents and five siblings near Geelong in regional Victoria.  In the documentary Calum von Moger: Unbroken, he described himself as a daredevil who was always trying to keep up with his brothers. The film detailed Moger's rise through the bodybuilding ranks to a point where he was dubbed 'Arnold 2.0' and how that came crashing down following a significant knee and bicep injury while abseiling. 'I was pretty broken - pretty heartbroken,' he recalled. In the same year he nearly lost his home due to devastating fires in California. 'This year was the most challenging, I had these terrible injuries, the house, the fires, so many things that are trying to knock me off my feet - it's either going to make ya or break ya,' he said.  He started lifting weights at 14 and began entering competitions, but his big break came in 2017 when he was cast as young Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 2018 movie Bigger. Moger quickly rose to fame after uploading videos of his physique and training online, amassing a following of more than 3 million on Instagram. He tried a range of professions before pursuing bodybuilding full time, such as lifesaving, landscaping, touring adventure groups, skippering yachts and the army. When Australia was devastated by bushfires in 2019/2020, Moger launched a GoFundMe and raised more than $40,000 for the Wildlife Conservancy Fund.  'Even if you don't live in Australia, your contribution to this cause will mean so much to me, my friends and family,' he wrote. 'This is the sad reality of Australia in 2020. Any help is appreciated and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.'  Just days before he jumped out the window, Moger posted a bizarre social media post saying he 'messed up bad many times'. 'But I don't care about dwelling on negative thoughts of the past. All I care about is that I learn from my mistakes and become a better person. 'I'm trying my hardest to stay strong but I have my days too.' Another Instagram post featured a bizarre clip of him behind the wheel of his car with a parrot Ronnie on his shoulder, saying 'catch ya later... alligator' - in a hi-vis singlet. Fellow bodybuilder and Youtuber Nick Trigilli said Moger was in a 'rough spot' at the time of the incident.  Moger had reportedly been kicked out of his family's home in Australia in recent times.  'I hope this is rock bottom for him and he can get his life back,' Trigilli said. Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Moger's family for comment.

Australian Medical Association South Australia president Michelle Atchison revealed on Twitter her 26-year-old daughter Caillin had died on Wednesday. 'The light in our life has gone out. My beautiful and only daughter died yesterday,' Dr Atchison wrote on Thursday. 'She never woke up.  'It was so utterly unexpected and my husband and my hearts are shattered. I really don't know what to do.' Dr Atchison had become a public spokesperson for nurses and hospital staff during the Covid pandemic. She was critical of South Australia easing its border closure on November 23, warning the reopening would place further strain on the health system. She also presented the latest report into South Australia's healthcare system that revealed a crippling shortage of healthcare staff and beds in hospitals.  News of her recent loss sparked an outpouring of grief from social media users and public figures alike. SA Health Minister Chris Picton shared his heartbreaking in a touching post. 'Michelle this is so absolutely awful and shocking. I am devastated for your loss. Sending love to your family at this incredibly difficult time,' he wrote.  Journalist and radio broadcast Jo McManus revealed she had lost her son when he was a teenager. 'I don't know you Michelle but I'm so, so sorry for your loss,' she tweeted. 'We lost our beautiful 20 year old son in 2015 - suddenly, unexpectedly and we still don't know why. Surround yourself with loving friends and family. And celebrate your gorgeous girl, always.'  Central Adelaide Local Health Network chief data and analytics officer Andrew McAlindon tweeted he had also lost a son. 'I'm so sorry to hear that. Our beautiful 32 year old GP Registrar son was taken last year from the side effects of Bleomycin lung poisoning after only two months,' he posted. 'No one can understand what you are going through. Hoping you receive support and love from friends and family.'  Dr Atchison was concerned South Australia was reopening its borders too soon when it welcomed back tourists last November.  South Australia had intended to lift its borders when 80 per cent of its residents were double vaccinated. The state had not reached the milestone before it decided to reopen. Dr Atchison warned the decision had been made too soon and that Covid cases would rise drastically. 'Covid will come into South Australia and we are worried about how the health system is going to manage it,' she said. 'The sad reality is there are going to be cases coming in, whether it is this week or the next couple of weeks, we are likely to see some cases happening before Christmas.'", "fdb23b75016951c3947f559554ae8b90430fcc2085b9ac8a60436d4d": "There is no doubt that the Civil Service and sclerotic government agencies which affect key areas of our everyday life are in desperate need of urgent, radical reform.

Seemingly institutional indolence at the DVLA has led to waits of up to three months for a driving licence, infuriating motorists and worsening HGV driver shortages. Holidays are being ruined by long delays in sending out new passports. There are similar hold-ups in granting probate. Boris Johnson has described their attitude as a 'manana culture' - never do today what you can put off until tomorrow. So he is right to tackle this incalcitrance by ordering a 'bonfire of bureaucrats'. Such a philosophical attack is overdue.  The great blob of Left-wing, Remain obduracy at the heart of Whitehall tries to thwart or slow down every Conservative reform - from post-Brexit trade deals to the Rwanda immigration policy. By slashing the size of the Civil Service by 91,000 - a fifth - and investing in new technology, the Prime Minister hopes to clear backlogs and free up billions of pounds to ease the cost of living crisis. Yes, ministers will face intense opposition from Labour and the unions. But staff numbers will only return to 2016 levels. Of course, even if successful, such reforms take time. With the living squeeze already hurting, time is a commodity families don't have.  So, Mr Johnson has left the door open to a windfall tax on energy giants' profits to help struggling households. This paper believes firmly in the free market, but for years these corporations have fleeced their loyal customers. So while we have reservations about a one-off grab, it is difficult in the face of such hardship to condemn it. And given this would reduce the risk of a Labour government in 2024, the firms must know which side their bread's buttered. The PM should also put more money in people's pockets by cutting income tax and VAT and scrapping hated green levies. Long-term solutions are all well and good for tomorrow. But they won't heat the house, pay the mortgage or feed the family today. Not so smart M-ways For years the Department for Transport and National Highways have been trying to tell us smart motorways were safe - safer even than traditional highways. Common sense told us this couldn't be so. Remove the hard shoulder and you remove the stranded motorist's crucial last line of defence.  But no, they said. Research showed smart motorways led to fewer accidents and fatalities. Today that myth is exploded.  A National Highways review, triggered by a damning Mail investigation, found that deaths and serious injuries were massively higher for broken-down drivers on smart motorways.

Mrs Vardy broke down in court and the hearing had to be halted twice as she described the fall-out from Mrs Rooney's famous 'Wagatha Christie' tweet. It declared that she had been betrayed, adding: 'It's... Rebekah Vardy's account.' The 40-year-old wife of Leicester City star Jamie Vardy said she was immediately bombarded with vile abuse and death threats. She told the High Court: 'It seemed she had weaponised her fan base against me.' The mother-of-five wiped away tears as she was accused of leaking private information about Mrs Rooney, attempting to destroy incriminating evidence and pinning the blame on her agent and friend Caroline Watt. Mrs Rooney's lawyer David Sherborne claimed Mrs Vardy had betrayed Mrs Watt by 'throwing her under the bus'. Mrs Vardy sobbed: 'She's been driven to suicidal thoughts by these proceedings and the antics of the defendant [Mrs Rooney].' The footballer's wife was led from the court in tears twice during the hearing and at the end of the day as she struggled during cross-examination by Mr Sherborne. She has told how she received a 'torrent of insults' and death threats within moments of Mrs Rooney's social media post in 2019. She was seven months pregnant and feared she could lose her unborn baby. Mrs Vardy is suing Mrs Rooney - wife of former England striker Wayne Rooney - for libel over the post, which led to her being dubbed 'Wagatha Christie'. The courtroom burst into laughter yesterday when Rebekah Vardy admitted she didn't know who Davy Jones was. It came as the court was reminded that Mrs Vardy's agent Caroline Watt had said in an earlier hearing that her phone had fallen into the North Sea. David Sherborne, for Coleen Rooney, said: 'We know that Miss Watt's phone is now in Davy Jones' Locker, don't we, Mrs Vardy?' Mrs Vardy replied: 'I'm sorry, I don't know who Davy Jones is.' Amid laughter, the judge explained that the idiom related to the resting place of drowned sailors. The character also appears in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series, with Bill Nighy, pictured above, playing the role of the tyrannical captain.   She accused Mrs Rooney of deliberately provoking the furore, saying: 'She knows exactly how aggressive and nasty the social media community can be... She should have used her influence and reach to call the trolls off. She didn't.' In a series of tense exchanges with Mr Sherborne, Mrs Vardy was repeatedly accused of leaking information from Mrs Rooney's private Instagram account to The Sun and of lying in her evidence to the court. Mr Sherborne asked: 'Would you not agree, Mrs Vardy, that if it looks like a leak and it sounds like a leak - and you even use the word leak - that it's more likely than not to be a leak... That's what you are, isn't it, a leak?' 'No,' Mrs Vardy said repeatedly, shaking her head and wiping her eyes. The lawyer claimed she had betrayed Mrs Watt, expecting her 'to do the dirty work' by contacting journalists and then attempting to pin the blame on her. He said: 'It's you that betrayed her by throwing her under the bus.' Mrs Vardy broke down, shaking her head and muttering: 'That's a joke.' WhatsApp messages between Mrs Watt and Mrs Vardy have been read to the court in which the two women discussed posts on Mrs Rooney's private Instagram account. Mrs Vardy insists they were gossiping and she was joking about leaking the information, although she has admitted that Mrs Watt may have contacted journalists. Mrs Watt, 40, was expected to be called as a witness but the court has heard she is now receiving psychiatric care and has been deemed too unwell to give evidence. Experts were also unable to analyse her iPhone after she accidentally dropped it overboard while filming the Scottish coastline on a boat trip - days after the court ordered the mobile should be searched. Mr Sherborne said the episode was part of a 'catalogue of so-called unfortunate events' which had affected the case. The court heard that screenshots and videos sent on the WhatsApp chat between Mrs Vardy and Mrs Watt were permanently deleted during a data transfer and Mrs Vardy's laptop was discarded after it stopped working. Mrs Vardy repeatedly denied she had deliberately deleted potentially incriminating evidence and disposed of her laptop. She said she believed the messages would have been 'extremely helpful' to proving her case. Earlier, Mr Sherborne accused her of 'selective amnesia' over her recollection of events. She denied she had orchestrated a tip-off to paparazzi over a photo of her with other England Wags - wives and girlfriends - during the World Cup in Russia in 2018. She and Mrs Watt exchanged messages in which they appeared to plan the photo, but Mrs Vardy said it was only intended to be a picture of her. The photo led to complaints from Wags and at least one player as English football bosses wanted media coverage focused on the team and the tournament rather than the wives and girlfriends. In a message to Mrs Watt, Mrs Vardy said: 'England will do their nut.' Asked about an article about the Wags at the World Cup, Mrs Vardy said: 'If I'm honest, I can't remember that at all.' Mr Sherborne replied: 'Well, I would much rather you were honest because you are in a witness box under oath.' The court also heard a message she sent to Mrs Rooney in which she suggested that her phone could have been hacked. She denied it was an attempt to divert suspicion away from her. In an uncomfortable exchange, she was also asked about an article which claimed the Rooneys' marriage was over - while Mrs Rooney and Wayne sat feet away from her. Mrs Rooney, 36, is expected to start her evidence in the PS3million libel trial today. She took copious notes throughout former friend Mrs Vardy's evidence and has reportedly signed a contract with Netflix to make a documentary about the trial. The case continues. nSinger Peter Andre yesterday complained he has taken 'hit after hit' for years after Mrs Vardy compared his private parts to a chipolata. The quote was mentioned earlier in the case. Andre, 49, who is said to have had a fling with Mrs Vardy in 2001, posted a video online claiming there would be 'absolute outrage' if he made a jibe about her anatomy. He added: 'I've taken it for 15 years.' Oh Bex! This may just be a spectacular own goal: On Day 3 of Wagatha Watch, JANE FRYER sees Rebekah Vardy having a nightmare in court Another dawn, another day - and yet another set of gigantic Dynasty-style shoulders to demonstrate who's really Queen of the Wags in the PS3million libel battle setting Britain alight. There's no doubt about it, yesterday was Coleen Rooney's day - and not just in the Isabel Marant-designed shoulder department. No, the day was Coleen's because despite Rebekah Vardy's jaunty nautical-themed Chanel dress and brave new side parting, the events in Court 13 are not unfurling as Mrs V would like. In short, she's having a nightmare. Things start to decline badly and rapidly as she is accused - variously and in no particular order - of having selective amnesia, lying, repeatedly revising her witness statements ahead of the trial and suggesting that the anniversary of the death of Coleen's sister Rosie (who died in 2014, aged 13) had been an appropriate time to get back in contact with Rooney after she had blocked Vardy on Instagram. So in that context, the claim she'd arranged for a pap to hide in a bush and snap the entire Wag brigade as they click-clacked down the street to dinner in St Petersburg during the 2018 World Cup comes almost as a moment of light relief for Bex. Even if it was technically against explicit instructions by the FA that they all keep a low profile - and she hadn't technically bothered to warn her fellow Wags - it is a relatively low-key accusation to weather amid today's storm. No wonder Coleen's so perky and pleased with herself. She looks like the Wag that got all the best goodie-bag swag as she scrawls in her leopard-print note pad, smirks at Vardy's lawyers and sips her water as if it's already victory champagne. She even gleefully pokes Wayne at one point with a pencil in his enormous ham-like arm! She wants him to feel included in the fun. On we lurch like drunk drivers swerving between endless allegations about Vardy's mad behaviour. That she was the source behind the 'Secret Wag' column in The Sun that leaked lurid claims of serial cheaters at Chelsea FC. And how she dared to christen herself the 'unofficial leader of the Wags' in an interview she gave about a no-sex ban for England players during the 2018 tournament. And, of course, the harder she denies it all, the harder her own expletive-ridden Whats- App messages smash back in her face. It's a terrible buffeting. And Teflon-tough though Vardy clearly is, she'd be forgiven for wishing she had a sturdy husband of her own to lean on in court. Her nemesis, meanwhile, continues to scribble like a woman possessed. Is it a shopping list, a winner's speech or just another holiday packing itinerary? Who knows! Next to her, Wayne glowers and glares and scowls and stares. (If she'd tried, Coleen couldn't have dreamt up a better punishment for all he's put her through during their 14-year marriage.) Back on the stand, Rebekah has another cry - arms folded on witness box, head laid despairingly down on arms - apparently triggered by recalling the appalling online abuse she's endured. Or perhaps she's finally realised what a spectacular own goal this whole palaver might turn out to be. A self-administered spatchcocking of her own shameless making. A total car crash of self-indulgence. Because even if Vardy wins on the narrow point of law - which she might - she's clearly also lost in the court of public opinion. (Then again, haven't they all?). But perhaps most upsetting of all is the realisation that - even though Jamie's still a mean, lean scoring machine (another two goals on Wednesday night, thank you very much) and Coleen's chubby hubby doesn't play any more (and his team has just been relegated, sorry Wayne) - Vardy will never, ever be crowned Queen of the Wags, however many Duchess of Cambridge look-a-like jackets she packs into her walk-in wardrobe. Poor Rebekah. How to recover from a day like this? A nice calming spa treatment and a hair mask? A bottle of Grey Goose on the rocks? And then the phone call home... 'How'd it go, love?' Jamie squeaks. 'Oh you know, pretty good. Pretty good! I think we've got that **** on the ropes. But also hun, while you've got a min... could you be a darling and pop three mill in the current account? Just in case!'", "51b50ebe2dee8718fb1e66c59bfef32d380683461dd1d450eb27c40a": "Do Kwon, the mastermind behind failing cryptocurrencies TerraUSD and Luna, is drawing scrutiny and criticism after the collapse of his venture triggered a massive meltdown in the broader crypto market this week. Kwon, 29, is the brash CEO of Terraform Labs, the company behind the two related technologies: stablecoin TerraUSD, which is supposed to trade 1-to-1 with the US dollar, and governance token Luna, which is supposed to ensure the stable exchange rate. Thanks in part to his big personality and confident pitch, Kwon was able to attract high-profile investors, including the venture capital arm of the major exchange Coinbase. But after TerraUSD 'de-pegged' from the dollar this week, trading as low as 23 cents amid panicked selling, it triggered a broader meltdown that sent the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, to its lowest level since 2020. Issuer Luna plunged more than 99 percent in value on Thursday, and was trading at far below one cent, down from a high of $120 last month.    Now, a columnist for industry news site CoinDesk is calling Kwon 'the Elizabeth Holmes of crypto' in a stinging comparison to the convicted fraudster who fleeced investors for billions. Kwon's image has also not been helped by his longstanding habit of dismissing his critics as 'poor' and, just over a week ago, his gleeful comment in an interview that there is 'entertainment in watching companies die.' A spokesperson for Kwon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com on Thursday afternoon. In a blistering column on Thursday, CoinDesk writer David Z. Morris compared Kwon to both Holmes and infamous Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who was convicted of felony fraud charges in that company's collapse. 'At the very least, he's doing a great impression of a man who really believes in what he's selling,' Morris wrote of Kwon. 'Despite reams of critical appraisals of the fundamental structure of Luna, Kwon not only stayed the course, but over the last 24 hours has angled to find more capital to flush through the holes in his sinking flagship,' the columnist added. 'He's nowhere near acknowledging that he put the holes there when he built it.'  The meltdown in TerraUSD, one of the world's largest stablecoins, rippled through cryptocurrency markets on Thursday, pushing another major stablecoin Tether below its dollar peg and sending bitcoin to 16-month lows.   Stablecoin TerraUSD has been hit by the turmoil and broke its peg to the U.S. dollar, which led to it falling as low as 31 cents on Wednesday. On Thursday it was trading around 47 cents. Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to the value of traditional assets, such as the U.S. dollar.  But TerraUSD is an algorithmic, or 'decentralised', stablecoin, and was supposed to maintain its dollar peg via a complex mechanism which involved swapping it with another free-floating token. 'The collapse of the peg in TerraUSD has had some nasty and predictable spillovers. We have seen broad liquidation in BTC, ETH and most ALT coins,' said Richard Usher, head of OTC trading at BCB Group, referring to other cryptocurrencies. Even stablecoins backed by traditional assets were showing signs of stress on Thursday. Tether slipped below its 1:1 dollar peg, hitting as a low of 95 cents around 0724 GMT on Thursday, based on CoinMarketCap data. 'The lack of transparency provided by Tether on the quality of commercial paper they hold to back the peg made it the obvious next target,' said BCB Group's Usher. 'However, Tether is a very different animal to Terra, with a more proven ecosystem and I have far more confidence that when volatility subsides it can regain its peg and stability,' he said. Paolo Ardoino, Tether's chief technology officer, said in a Twitter Spaces chat that the stablecoin had reduced its exposure to commercial paper over the last six months and now holds the majority of its reserves in U.S. Treasuries. Ardoino said a quarterly update on Tether's reserves would be available later in the month. Tether, is the largest stablecoin by market cap, and, along with USD Coin and Binance USD, they account for almost 87% of the total $169.5 billion stablecoin market, according to CoinMarketCap. The large number of centralised cryptocurrency exchanges and decentralised venues, each with their own liquidity profile and credit risk, was adding to price distortions across the market, to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Corinthian Digital Asset Management, said. 'The spillover effects into other stablecoins is in part driven by the fragmented nature of the market,' Vinokourov said. 'This credit risk, especially during the times of tight liquidity conditions and mass deleveraging leads to further price distortions.' Market players are still assessing the impact TerraUSD's troubles on investors. In its biannual Financial Stability Report on Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve warned that stablecoins are vulnerable to investor runs because they are backed by assets that can lose value or become illiquid in times of market stress.", "56843dc48be067c5f1021e45ce6673c6e0a88bb612bef4a2fea5e652": "Another dawn, another day - and yet another set of gigantic Dynasty-style shoulders to demonstrate who's really Queen of the Wags in the PS3million libel battle setting Britain alight.

Coleen 'weaponised her fans to turn against me': Tearful Vardy's claim as PS3m libel trial is halted twice  By Vanessa Allen  Weeping Wag Rebekah Vardy yesterday claimed Coleen Rooney 'weaponised' her fans when she accused her of leaking stories to the Press. Mrs Vardy broke down in court and the hearing had to be halted twice as she described the fall-out from Mrs Rooney's famous 'Wagatha Christie' tweet. It declared that she had been betrayed, adding: 'It's... Rebekah Vardy's account.' The 40-year-old wife of Leicester City star Jamie Vardy said she was immediately bombarded with vile abuse and death threats. She told the High Court: 'It seemed she had weaponised her fan base against me.' The mother-of-five wiped away tears as she was accused of leaking private information about Mrs Rooney, attempting to destroy incriminating evidence and pinning the blame on her agent and friend Caroline Watt. Mrs Rooney's lawyer David Sherborne claimed Mrs Vardy had betrayed Mrs Watt by 'throwing her under the bus'. Mrs Vardy sobbed: 'She's been driven to suicidal thoughts by these proceedings and the antics of the defendant [Mrs Rooney].' The footballer's wife was led from the court in tears twice during the hearing and at the end of the day as she struggled during cross-examination by Mr Sherborne. She has told how she received a 'torrent of insults' and death threats within moments of Mrs Rooney's social media post in 2019. She was seven months pregnant and feared she could lose her unborn baby. Mrs Vardy is suing Mrs Rooney - wife of former England striker Wayne Rooney - for libel over the post, which led to her being dubbed 'Wagatha Christie'. The courtroom burst into laughter yesterday when Rebekah Vardy admitted she didn't know who Davy Jones was. It came as the court was reminded that Mrs Vardy's agent Caroline Watt had said in an earlier hearing that her phone had fallen into the North Sea. David Sherborne, for Coleen Rooney, said: 'We know that Miss Watt's phone is now in Davy Jones' Locker, don't we, Mrs Vardy?' Mrs Vardy replied: 'I'm sorry, I don't know who Davy Jones is.' Amid laughter, the judge explained that the idiom related to the resting place of drowned sailors. The character also appears in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series, with Bill Nighy, pictured above, playing the role of the tyrannical captain.   She accused Mrs Rooney of deliberately provoking the furore, saying: 'She knows exactly how aggressive and nasty the social media community can be... She should have used her influence and reach to call the trolls off. She didn't.' In a series of tense exchanges with Mr Sherborne, Mrs Vardy was repeatedly accused of leaking information from Mrs Rooney's private Instagram account to The Sun and of lying in her evidence to the court. Mr Sherborne asked: 'Would you not agree, Mrs Vardy, that if it looks like a leak and it sounds like a leak - and you even use the word leak - that it's more likely than not to be a leak... That's what you are, isn't it, a leak?' 'No,' Mrs Vardy said repeatedly, shaking her head and wiping her eyes. The lawyer claimed she had betrayed Mrs Watt, expecting her 'to do the dirty work' by contacting journalists and then attempting to pin the blame on her. He said: 'It's you that betrayed her by throwing her under the bus.' Mrs Vardy broke down, shaking her head and muttering: 'That's a joke.' WhatsApp messages between Mrs Watt and Mrs Vardy have been read to the court in which the two women discussed posts on Mrs Rooney's private Instagram account. Mrs Vardy insists they were gossiping and she was joking about leaking the information, although she has admitted that Mrs Watt may have contacted journalists. Mrs Watt, 40, was expected to be called as a witness but the court has heard she is now receiving psychiatric care and has been deemed too unwell to give evidence. Experts were also unable to analyse her iPhone after she accidentally dropped it overboard while filming the Scottish coastline on a boat trip - days after the court ordered the mobile should be searched. Mr Sherborne said the episode was part of a 'catalogue of so-called unfortunate events' which had affected the case. The court heard that screenshots and videos sent on the WhatsApp chat between Mrs Vardy and Mrs Watt were permanently deleted during a data transfer and Mrs Vardy's laptop was discarded after it stopped working.

A small shop that used to cost just $40 is now typically adding up to $100, with the Reserve Bank expecting inflation to accelerate even more by Christmas. A leading consumer group audit of supermarket prices found some items had doubled during the past year, with a prices for a popular soft drink soaring by 94 per cent. The first interest rate rise in more than a decade is squeezing household budgets, with borrowers paying off a typical $600,000 mortgage facing a $700 surge in their monthly mortgage repayments within a year. Australians in mortgage stress face going broke as they juggle higher grocery and power bills. Now prolonged lockdowns in China are expected to push up the global price of imported goods, making the hip pocket pain even worse. Electricity prices are also expected to increase by $273 a year for a family of four following a doubling of national wholesale prices during the past year. Little wonder Australians are nervous with a Westpac-Melbourne Institute monthly consumer sentiment survey for May showing financial anxiety back at levels last seen in August 2020 when Melbourne went back into lockdown, sparking a new round of panic buying at supermarkets. A Daily Mail Australia survey of supermarket shoppers showed cost of living pressures really biting after floods pushed up fruit and vegetable prices, and as Russia's Ukraine war nudges petrol prices back towards $2 a litre.

'Honestly, I'm dying. It was just a small shop,' she said. 'There was nothing, just some snack food - chips, chocolate, strawberries.  'I didn't even get the other essential goods. 'Usually, a shop like this would cost $30 or $40. 'This is not normal. It's not fair.' A fuller trolley would now cost Monique close to $400 in Sydney. 'If I were to have done the full shop, it would have been $300 or $400,' Monique said. Her concerns about grocery prices doubling, despite what the official inflation figures say, is backed up by consumer group One Big Switch, which in March revealed some items at supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths had increased by up to 94 per cent in a year.  Two-litre bottles of orange Fanta sold at Coles had the biggest increase, with prices almost doubling from $2.35 to $4.55. At Woolworths, a 10-pack of Kirks cans climbed by 70 per cent from $6.20 to $10.55 Married couple Nour and Michael said rising consumer prices and weak wages growth had stopped them from buying a home. 'There's not even a chance for us to think about it,' Nour said. Michael said they had friends who were at risk of losing their home after recently buying as the market was peaking. 'I know a lot of people whose extra $50 makes a huge difference at the end of the month,' he said. 'I always wanted to buy, but whatever money you have doesn't take you that far anymore. 'Now I see it like a life sentence in the sense that if the interest rate goes up 0.25 per cent you're at risk of losing your house.' A surge in property prices last year, when Reserve Bank of Australia interest rates were at a record-low of 0.1 per cent, has locked many young people out of property. Even in a slowing market, Sydney's median house price surged by 17.1 per cent in the year to April to an even more unaffordable $1.417million, CoreLogic data showed.

Should interest rates rise seven more times during the coming year, a borrower with a typical $600,000 mortgage would see their monthly mortgage repayments climb by $713 to $3,019. A 2.15 percentage point increase in RBA interest rates, as predicted by two big banks, would be the fastest annual cash rate surge since 1994.  When inflation is above the RBA's two to three per cent target, interest rates are more likely to keep rising.  Headline inflation in the year to March surged by 5.1 per cent, the fastest annual pace since June 2001 in the year after the GST was introduced. The Reserve Bank is expecting inflation to hit 6 per cent by the end of 2022, a level that would be double the September 2021 pace of 3 per cent. A closer look at the Australian Bureau of Statistics consumer price index data showed fruit and vegetable prices soaring by 6.7 per cent, following floods along the east coast. The price of meat and seafood rose by 6.2 per cent over the year, more than double the 3 per cent increase in bread and cereals. Tina Khan said buying the ingredients for an Italian rice dish to feed a family of five pushed her grocery bill into the three-digit figures. 'Today I was just getting ingredients to make my son risotto,' she said. 'I just bought a few things and it was $138.' Ms Khan has even tried buying her fruit and vegetables in bulk to save money. 'I pay a lot a week because normally every one or two days I go grocery shopping,' she said.  'Each shop does not have everything I need. I didn't buy any vegetables. I still need to get the vegetables.' Ms Khan now has to shop three or four times a week to keep her grocery bill down.  'Today I didn't find any nice fresh vegetables here so I might go to another suburb,' she said.

Margaret, an aged pensioner, has also been forced to shop around to nab the best prices.  'When you're on a pension, you've got to do what you've got to do,' she said. 'I figured out in my brain how much I had to spend and I spent accordingly.' Margaret said $22 bought her four meals from Coles, with much of the bill paid for by some sheer good luck. 'I won $20 at bingo, so I spent $22,' she said. 'I've got baked beans and spaghetti in there, little tins. That was only $5 worth. So that's less than $2.50 for a meal on toast,' she said.

They're on the pension, they're paying rent, and they're not even buying food. They are living off tin stuff. 'And I think they are getting that from support services - they aren't even buying that.' Bronwyn said she had just completed a grocery trip for a client who is better off financially than others she works with but the woman still could not afford fresh meat on her budget. 'This shop is two weeks worth of groceries and was like $297, but this is only veggies and bread. There is no meat - only three slices of ham,' she said. 'She's living off frozen fish.'

'We don't have a mortgage to pay off anymore, so we don't have any sort of issues as far as the overall cost of living is concerned on the bottom line. 'But I sympathize with everybody with the way things are going. My nephew bought a home a few years ago and interest rates are going up.' Electricity prices are also set to rise with the Australian Energy Market Operator noting annual wholesale prices had more than doubled to $87 in the March quarter - rising by 141 per cent in a year. Wholesale prices make up about 30 per cent of a power bill. One Big Switch campaign director Joel Gibson said that would mean a 28 per cent annual increase of $273 for a family of four using 3,900 kilowatt hours of power a year. 'If you're not prepared to shop around and switch this year, your power bill could end up ballooning by hundreds of dollars, on top of groceries, petrol and mortgage increases,' he said. ReAmped Advance had the cheapest electricity in Sydney, data from the federal government's Energy Made Easy website showed. Customers however have received emails advising that usage rates would rise by 43 per cent from May 24. Mariam Gabaji, financial comparison website Finder's energy expert, had bad news for consumers. 'Energy prices are expected to skyrocket,' she said. South Australia has the nation's most expensive average quarterly electricity bill of $383.30 followed by New South Wales ($353.80), Victoria ($319.50), Queensland ($312.70) and Western Australia ($254.40), Finder consumer tracker data for May 2022 showed. If that wasn't bad enough, strict lockdowns in Shanghai as part of China's Covid-zero policy are set to push up the global price of key consumer goods, from Apple iPhones to furniture. Credit ratings agency Fitch said that with China accounting for 15 per cent of global merchandise exports, consumers across the world would suffer as lockdowns stopped drivers taking goods to ports. 'The lockdown in Shanghai will exacerbate global supply-chain pressures and inflation concerns,' it said. On top of that, a shortage of semiconductors from Taiwan is already delaying the production of cars and a range of electronic goods requiring computer chips to function. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index for May produced a score of just 90.4 points - a level well below the 100 level where optimists outnumber pessimists.  The survey of 1,200 people produced the worst monthly reading since August 2020 when Melbourne went back into a prolonged lockdown.  Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said consumers were clearly worried about rising interest rates and higher costs of living.  'Consumers are aware that the Reserve Bank plans to continue increasing the cash rate for some time,' he said.", "556829429868e0eab68f0f827342ed9825456180e4d714c3fd2a0e71": "A Queensland town is underwater with a massive swathe of the state is set to get smashed by yet another heavy rainfall event spurred by a massive low-pressure system. The main street of Laidley - a historic valley town just off the highway between Brisbane and Toowoomba - was so consumed by floodwater on Friday morning it more resembled a river.  Residents of the Lockyer Valley area fled low-lying homes overnight after being woken up by a flood siren, door knocks, and instructions to evacuate, following days of heavy rain.  A huge low-pressure trough is due to dump intense rainfall of up to 132mm across Brisbane, Ipswich. Darling Downs, the Sunshine Coast and Bundaberg in just six hours.  The Lockyer Valley Regional Council has urged residents not to wait for emergency services to help them and to head for higher ground before it's too late. Many roads are already closed in the valley, 115 marked as unsafe to drive on,  and some bridges already flooded. 'Act now - do not wait for emergency services to knock on your door,' Lockyer Valley Regional Council said in an alert.  The Bureau of Meteorology has warned the mammoth predicted rainfall totals could mean life-threatening flash floods and potential landslides between Gladstone, Coolangatta and the Darling Downs. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services swiftwater teams conducted seven rescues overnight and responded to more than 900 calls for help.  QFES Assistant Commissioner Andrew Short said residents should reconsider their need to travel, with hundreds of roads already cut by floodwaters. Almost 70 schools have already been closed. 'Currently, we've got 18 emergency alerts out in a number of councils,' he told ABC Radio on Friday. 'So we're looking for people just to listen and respond and act accordingly.' Brisbane City Council has suspended ferry services and opened sandbagging stations, with residents in flood-prone areas being advised to move their cars to higher ground. The lower Brisbane River is expected to reach a minor flood level on Friday morning, but Emergency Services Minister Mark Ryan said updated forecasts of intense rain could pose a risk of flash flooding into Saturday. 'Those falls could be up to 160mm over six hours, so creek catchments could rise very quickly, particularly given the creek catchments are so water-saturated at the moment,' he told ABC Radio. 'Anyone who is in a creek catchment or river area needs to be very well aware of their circumstances because the rain can become heavy to intense very quickly, and that means that there is a severe risk of flash flooding.' The unseasonal downpour is Queensland's sixth deadly flood since December, which scientists have put down to a second La Nina weather pattern in two years. Others on Australia's east coast are being warned to batten down the hatches once again as the weekend of wild weather looms over the rest of Queensland and New South Wales. As the weekend arrives, more of Australia's east coast will be smashed by flash flooding, torrential downpours, thunderstorms, powerful winds and hazardous surf conditions, causing widespread havoc across at least three states. The same weather system currently flooding South Queensland is delivering a steady stream of moisture stretching 3,000 kilometres right down to Tasmania. Flood warnings have been issued across central west NSW as Sydney and Canberra prepare for a soggy end to the working week. The other side of the country hasn't been spared either, with warnings for damaging winds, flash flooding and fires in place across Western Australia.  The continued wild weather is due to La Nina, which is 'unusually well-established' for this time of the year. 'Rain and thunderstorms will continue to soak a broad area from eastern Australia on Friday and even linger over some areas into the weekend,' Weatherzone's Ben Domensino said. 'While the heaviest rain has now cleared western and northern Queensland, other areas in central and southern Queensland, and northern, central and southern NSW, could see localised flooding during the next 48 hours.' After a soggy few days, Sydney can expect another 25mm soaking on Friday before showers clear. A strong wind warning is in place for the most of the NSW coastline from Byron Bay in the north to Batemans Bay in the south. More heavy rain is expected in the state's central west, which may cause minor flooding along the Castlereagh, Macquarie and Bell rivers. The Riverina district in southern NSW has also been hammered with heavy rain. In the nation's capital, this week's rain has seen Canberra surge past its average May rainfall in what is typically the driest month of the year. Canberrans will wake up to another soggy start on Friday before showers ease later in the day.    Queensland continues to be battered by the widespread wild weather that claimed the life a woman who disappeared in floodwaters in Mackay earlier this week. 'Storms likely to contain heavy rainfall, damaging wind gusts possible. Saturated soils likely to exacerbate flash flooding risk for parts of Sunshine Coast, Wide Bay, Capricornia Darling Downs,' the Bureau of Meteorology stated. Beaches on the Gold and Sunshine coast will stay closed as dangerous surf and huge swells smash the coastline.  Weatherzone warned the system could dump three to five months worth of rain in some parts of the state. 'Moving into Friday, we see the focus move to the southeast and, after that, the system moves away to the east and conditions improve on the weekend,' meteorologist Christie Johnson said. Residents living along Cooby Creek near Toowoomba have been warned to get ready to evacuate after the Cooby Dam started spilling. Melbourne is forecast for a grey weekend with high chances of low rainfall heading into next week. 'Melbourne could get a shower today,' the bureau said.  'We're right on the bottom of the weather system that's affecting Queensland and NSW.' 'A cold front will move through Melbourne on the weekend, so we'll see showers on Saturday and hang around on Sunday. 'The coolest of that air will start to come in on Monday and Tuesday, with showers expected each day.'  Over in the west, heavy rainfall has battered Perth and Western Australia's southern regions. Fouracres in the far southwest received 60.4mm on Thursday while Garden Island off the Perth coast received 47.6mm. A low-pressure system will deepen and move northwards to be just south of Albany by Friday morning bringing heavy rain and wind gusts of up to 90km/h. Emergency WA said centres that could be impacted include Albany, Mount Barker, Augusta, Bremer Bay, Denmark, Hopetoun, Pemberton, Walpole and Windy Harbour. Conditions are expected to ease by Friday afternoon. 'While heavy rain is one of the main threats from this system, its blustery winds are also creating dangerous fire weather in parts of the state's north,' Weatherzone said. 'Very high fire danger ratings may also occur in the Eucla and South Interior districts on Friday as the front moves further east. ' Cloudy weather is settling in over Adelaide but no rain is expected until Saturday, with a maximum rainfall of 3mm forecast. Clouds will partially leave Hobart on Friday before light showers set in Saturday through to next week. The grey skies are predicted to be paired with cold temperatures with a low of 9C expected on Friday. In the Top End, Darwin will see a cloudy start to the weekend before the sunshine moves in on Sunday and sticks around through to next Tuesday. The sunny weather will see maximum temperatures reach the low 30s and lows sit comfortably in the low 20s.  PERTH Friday Shower or two. Min 7 Max 19 Saturday Shower or two.

Nylah Anderson of Philadelphia was found unconscious in her mom's bedroom closet on December 7. She hung herself from a purse strap after seeing videos related to the 'blackout challenge' on the app's 'For You' page, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Pennsylvania. The challenge encourages users to asphyxiate themselves, pass out and regain consciousness on camera.  Nylah's mother Tawainna says the company is to blame for her death because the content 'was thrust in front of' her. 'I cannot stop replaying this day in my head,' Tawainna said at a press conference Thursday. 'The unbreakable bond in our family is now shattered and void.' Last year, a 12-year-old boy died after using a shoelace to choke himself for the same challenge, his family says. Nylah was an 'active, happy, healthy, and incredibly intelligent child' who spoke three languages, according to the lawsuit. She is survived by her mother and her two brothers, Nakye Anderson and Kevin Freeman Lamarr Neal III. The 10-year-old girl tried the 'blackout challenge' in her mom's closet while her mom was downstairs. A forensic analysis of her phone showed that the app was in use at the time, according to her mom's attorneys.  'Nylah endured hellacious suffering as she struggled and fought for breath and slowly asphyxiated until near the point of death,' the lawsuit states. Tawainna found her daughter and tried multiple rounds of CPR on her until paramedics arrived. Nylah spent five days in the pediatric ICU and died on December 12, 2021. Her family's lawsuit, which asks for unspecified damages, holds TikTok accountable for designing an app that promotes dangerous challenges to children. A search for the hashtag #blackoutchallenge on TikTok yields no results as of Thursday afternoon. The company says its main app is intended for people 13 years or older, though it also operates a version of the app designed for younger users. In a statement before the lawsuit was filed, the Chinese-owned company said: 'This disturbing 'challenge,' which people seem to learn about from sources other than TikTok long predates our platform, and has never been a TikTok trend. 'We remain vigilant in our commitment to user safety and would immediately remove related content if found.' But Nylah's mother says the company intentionally designs its app to keep its young users' attention at any costs. The 'algorithm determined that the deadly blackout challenge was well-tailored and likely to be of interest to 10-year-old Nylah Anderson and she died as a result,' the lawsuit states. It cites a number of other dangerous challenges, including the 'Orbeez challenge,' which encourages viewers to shoot the plastic pellets at people. Also named is the 'Benadryl challenge,' in which people drink large amounts of the cough medicine until they hallucinate. Another one is the 'Nyquil Chicken Challenge,' which 'involves soaking chicken breast in cough medicine like Nyquil and cooking it, boiling off the water and alcohol in it and leaving the chicken saturated with a highly concentrated amount of drugs in the meat,' according to court documents. Tawainna Anderson's product liability and negligence lawsuit 'seeks to hold TikTok responsible for their role as designers, programers manufacturers sellers and distributors of their dangerously defective social media products and for their own independent acts of negligence.' Speaking with her lawyers at a press conference, Nylah's mom said she's taking a stand for other children. 'I accepted that my daughter voice is gone forever, so I'm going to speak for her, and the message here today is something has to change. 'Something has to stop because I wouldn't want any other parent to go through what I'm going through ever since December 7,' Tawainna said. Last April, a 12-year-old Colorado boy died after his parents say he used a shoelace to choke himself until he lost consciousness for the same challenge. The family of Joshua Haileyesus shared an update on a GoFundMe page that confirmed his passing.  'After fighting the good fight on life support for 19 days, Joshua has gone off to be with the Lord,' the family wrote.  'Your prayers and your love have comforted us and we are grateful for your support.'  Joshua was found passed out in the bathroom of his home by his twin brother on March 22, 2021.  His brother tried to resuscitate him until neighbors and the ambulance arrived, according to the family.  His family believes he may have been using the shoelace to take part in the Blackout Challenge, which has been circulating on TikTok over the last year.  Joshua's death is mentioned in the latest lawsuit.  TikTok is extremely popular among very young users. About 28 percent of its users are children under the age of 18, according to the lawsuit. By April 2020, the company's total worldwide downloads surpassed 2 million.

Families from across the America reached out to DailyMail.com, detailing their struggles and pleas for help as store shelves meant to hold formula remain barren and price gouging resellers auction the products online at ungodly mark-ups. One mother, whose six-month-old son has a severe dairy allergy, shared heartbreaking photos of a rash that overtook her infant's back after they were forced to switch formula brands. A father who traveled to more than a dozen retailers within 20 miles of his Pennsylvania home said he resorted to spending nearly $600 on eBay to get the formula his child needed. Meanwhile, Republicans sounded the alarm Thursday after discovering baby formula is being sent to border facilities while American mothers are facing empty shelves amid massive shortages. President Joe Biden will make his most visible move to try to tackle the shortage, as he meets with retailers and manufacturers on Thursday to try to find a way out of the crisis. The White House is also expected to announce new administrative steps to try to get more formula onto store shelves.  'This administration needs to treat this as the public health crisis it's at risk of becoming, rather than like a recall of any other replaceable food product or supply chain shortage,' father Chris Arroyo said, slamming the White House's response to the crisis. 'Leaving this in the FDA's court is not solving the problem.' Struggling mothers also shared the intimate details of their journeys with breastfeeding, with some noting they started to do so more and others sharing how they are devastated they can't nourish their child through breast milk. 'I was diagnosed with cancer when I was three months pregnant with my twins and was unable to breastfeed,' mother Christina Kikola shared. 'Breastfeeding is not an option for everyone.' 'My breast milk production could not keep up with [my son's] demand,' said Belle Holmes, whose son developed a rash from his new formula. 'Not to mention the slightest trace of dairy or dairy by-product in my diet would severely impact him. 'I have had to resume pumping and breastfeeding, which limited the feasibility of me returning to the workplace,' Jillian Ayorro, mother of a nearly two-year-old with allergies and special dietary needs, shared. She also noted that by eliminating the allergens and foods that would harm her daughter, she was depriving herself of necessary nutrients.  These parents, along with dozens of others who contacted DailyMail.com, have called on the FDA to reopen the Abbott Laboratories plant in Sturgis, Michigan and are asking Congress take steps to diminish the formula shortage crisis.  The Virginia firm Datasembly released a report revealing a nationwide out-of-stock rate of 43 percent for formula, putting low income families and those with special needs at risk.  Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are also pressing for action and have called the situation 'increasingly alarming.' The House Energy and Commerce Committee has scheduled hearings to address the shortage, but those that don't start for two weeks. GOP Representative Kat Cammack tweeted two images Thursday, one showing full shelves of baby formula and food from a processing center at the southern border and another showing empty shelves where baby formula was supposed to be at an American grocery store. 'The first photo is from this morning at the Ursula Processing Center at the U.S. border. Shelves and pallets packed with baby formula,' Cammack wrote. 'The second is from a shelf right here at home. Formula is scarce.' 'This is what America last looks like,' she added. Meantime, Abbott Nutrition announced Wednesday that it could have its Michigan plant up-and-running again in two weeks, once given the green-light from the FDA. However, it would still take an additional six to eight weeks before the manufacturer could start delivering product to store shelves.  The formula shortage is the result of supply chain disruptions and a safety recall, and has had a cascade of effects. Retailers are limiting what customers can buy, and doctors and health workers are urging parents to contact food banks or physicians' offices, in addition to warning against watering down formula to stretch supplies or using online DIY recipes.  The FDA warned consumers on February 17 to avoid some powdered baby formula products manufactured by Abbott Nutrition, which then initiated a voluntary recall.  According to findings released in March by federal safety inspectors, Abbott failed to maintain sanitary conditions and procedures at its Michigan manufacturing plant that was linked to a cluster of infant Cronobacter sakazaki infections. The findings showed the facility didn't maintain clean surfaces used in producing and handling the powdered formula. Additionally, inspectors found a history of contamination with the bacteria, including eight instances between fall 2019 and February of this year.  An Abbott spokesperson told DailyMail.com Wednesday that 'after a thorough review of all available data, there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses' The agency FDA claims it is working with U.S. manufacturers to increase their output of formula and streamlining paperwork to allow more imports.  The FDA also noted that supply chain issues associated with the pandemic were part of the problem and that consumers bought more baby formula in April than in the month before the recall. Baby with 'severe' allergies breaks out after forced formula switch Belle Holmes, like many other parents, is struggled to find her six-month-old's preferred formula brand amid the nationwide shortage. 'We have had to switch brands three times and each one has eventually gone out of stock,' she told DailyMail.com. Her son suffers from a 'severe dairy allergy' which makes it significantly harder to provide him with the proper nutrients he needs.  She also has to worry about adverse reactions caused by exposure to allergens.  Holmes shared photographs of her son's back covered in a rash that she has linked to consuming a new brand of formula. Additionally, the concerned mother explained that she cannot turn to breast feeding because she 'could not keep up with his demand' and was worried she 'would severely impact him' if she consumed any dairy whatsoever. 'We are on the last brand we can find and are nervous about what will happen next,' she added. Couple slams White House response to formula shortage as mother shares how she started breastfeeding again Jillian and Chris Arroyo, of Falls Church, Virginia, have called on legislators to take action after Jillian was forced to resume breastfeeding amid the formula shortage. 'Our daughter needs this formula. Kids rely on this formula to survive,' Chris added, criticizing a remark made by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Monday. 'Based on yesterday's briefing by the White House, it seems like the attitude in general is to keep letting the FDA call the shots.  'Jen Psaki said the FDA is 'working around the clock to address any possible shortage.' The problem is - it's not a possible shortage. It's a very real shortage, and leaving this in the FDA's court is not solving the problem.' Jillian, adding to her husband's remarks, shared how she was forced to resume pumping and breastfeeding in an effort to feed their daughter Ellie, 21 months. The concerned mother said the switch off of formula 'limited the feasibility of my returning to the workplace' and that she ultimately took a new job that was permanently work-from-home. 'I needed to be available to my daughter during this time and remove the stress and pressure around returning to the office,' she said. However, Ellie's return to breast milk was anything but smooth sailing.  'Our daughter has reacted to foods through my breastmilk since birth. After extensive food journaling and trial and error, I eliminated all the problem foods from my diet,' Jillian explained. 'We figured we'd be good to go, introduce her to solid foods, and wean her from breastmilk by her first birthday - the typical course. 'Ellie's journey has been anything but typical, and I breastfed on this elimination diet long past her first birthday until we finally found Elecare Jr. Once she'd been stable on her new formula for a few months, we made the decision to wean, and on February 12th, I nursed Ellie for what I thought was the last time.  'For six days I ate and drank whatever I wanted, carefree, with the weight of the world lifted off my shoulders. I was no longer the primary nutrition source for our medically challenging daughter, I no longer had to think about my own food intake around the clock, and I could eat and enjoy whatever I wanted. It was a really joyous week.' She continued: 'Six days later, we learned about the recall. I'm back on this diet for the foreseeable future. Until Ellie's formula is back in production, or we find a suitable alternative that she can tolerate, I am unable to eat dairy, wheat, soy, oats, peanuts, tree nuts, coconut, or tomatoes.  'The last time I saw my own doctor, she sarcastically told me it was kind of me to donate my skeleton to my daughter. It may have been sarcastic, but it was deeply rooted in truth - women who breastfeed are already at risk of nutritional deficits because our bodies will feed our babies first, leeching whatever nutrients are needed from our own stores. This is especially amplified by cutting out entire food groups, such as dairy. 'I never imagined I would be nursing my daughter past a year old. I certainly never imagined I would be nursing her at two or beyond, but the way things are going, I don't see a way out of this situation. I'm concerned for my physical and mental health.' Like many others, the Arroyo family has spent hundreds of dollars online purchasing their daughter's formula from price-gouging resellers.  They also started a Facebook group demanding authorities to reopen the Abbott plant and are encouraging other parents to lobby their state and local leaders. Mother rallies parents to call on legislators: 'We need to stand up!' Melissa Paolini, of Sicklerville, New Jersey, is organizing a rally of mothers struggling to feed their children and calling on federal officials to take action. 'It is unreal that we live in America in 2022 and can't feed our babies,' she told DailyMail.com. 'Moms are having to switch formulas for their babies nonstop. It's so unfair. We need to stand up about this. We are our babies voice!' Paolini's four-month-old son is on a special diet and uses a formula from a company called Stymco. The New Jersey mom said she ordered the product more than a week ago, but it has yet to arrive.  'I get my son's month supply from them,' she explained. 'They never contacted to tell me it wasn't coming.' She said that several other parents have cited the same complaints. 'This isn't the only company that people are having issues with. It's everywhere,' she argued. 'I've called the GI doctor and the pediatrician. No one can help.' Paolini argued that the shortage isn't just impacting families utilizing special dietary products, but has those who use standard, popular brands scrambling too. 'I know parents with children on nearly every formula are in a similar situation. They just may have a little more luck finding their formula in a store than me,' she said. 'As a mom we try to do everything we can for our babies. I have cried hysterical over this so much. A solution needs to be found!' In response, Paolini is working to organize an event in which parents can come together and rally on behalf of their children. She said event planning remains in the early stages, but in the meantime, she will continue to outreach to her congressmen and senators.  'If more people don't rise up, I don't think anything will be done about this crisis,' she stated. 'I want the U.S. to be addressing this issue. This is our babies. This is our future.' Father spends hundreds buying price-gouged formula online   Joe Bones, of Altoona, Pennsylvania, said it has been impossible find Similac Sensitive, the brand of formula he feeds his son, for nearly two months. The Bones family has struggled to find the speciality formula since their son was born last November, but claims the nationwide shortage and Abbott recall has greatly exasperated the situation.    'I went to eight different grocery stores, three different Walmarts, Target and every pharmacy in a 20 mile radius with no luck finding the formula for my son who has a sensitivity to milk,' Bones told DailyMail.com. 'At the start of recall when I couldn't find any in stores I had to resort to going to eBay and spending nearly $600 out of pocket on formula.'  The father said he was uncertain when the product would be back in stores, so he 'bought up all I could.'  While he noted that most resellers were 'pretty reasonable' with pricing, noting he would pay about $15 over retail price, that others were looking to take advantage of parents in a hopeless situation.  'I saw people on there asking for $200 for a single can of formula,' Bones said. 'I can only imagine the people who don't have the means and extra to buy out of pocket.  'I wouldn't even want to be that parent that was feeding their baby and they hit the bottom of the can and had no more left and couldn't find any anywhere.' Nationwide about 40 percent of large retail stores are out of stock of baby formula, up from 31 percent in mid-April, Datasembly reported. More than half of U.S. states are seeing out-of-stock rates between 40 percent and 50 percent, according to the firm, which collects data from 11,000 locations.  Bones, who said the months following the recall have been 'extremely stressful and frustrating,' said he wants the government to make policy changes to prevent future shortages.  'I would like to see lawmakers step in and force stricter sanitation standards so something like this does not happen in the future,' he shared. 'I would also like stricter standards on reselling formula over the internet.' The FDA, in a recent budget document, asked Congress to give the agency new authorities to prevent a critical shortage from occurring in the future.  'No law requires manufacturers of infant formulas or essential medical foods to notify FDA when they become aware of a circumstance that could lead to a shortage of these products,' the agency penned, noting it would like to see new protocols requiring companies to notify the FDA of anticipated supply chain interruptions.   White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday the Biden administration is working with manufacturers to ensure baby formula makes it back on empty shelves as frantic parents work to ensure their children are fed. 'Ensuring the availability of these products' is a 'priority' for the FDA, Psaki said at her daily press briefing, noting 'they're working around the clock to address any possible shortage.' It is unclear if the administration's response will include need requirements for manufacturers, as the FDA requested.  Mother battling cancer struggles to feed her twin babies Christina Kikola, of Erie, Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with cancer while three months pregnant with her twins, who are now seven-months-old. One of her infants, Nora, has 'severe allergies' and can only tolerate the Elecare or Neocate formula brands. Kikola said she tired four brands of 'regular' formula before finding a product her daughter could tolerate. Now, due to the shortage, she is unable to find those brands.   'Prior to finding Neocate she was constantly puking, crying in pain, arching to 'get away from her belly' so it seemed, and having bowel issues,' Kikola told DailyMail.com. 'Then it was recalled. Now it's on worldwide back order.' The mother has tried feeding Nora a comparable formula brand, but claims the baby has 'gone back to not eating well and having bowel issues.' Kikola has been in constant contact with her pediatrician's office, who is 'doing everything they can to try and get us Neocate,' but the supply remains limited. 'Reopen the plant in Michigan, open facilitates wherever possible to start mass production,' the mother pleaded. 'Our babies need fed. I was diagnosed with cancer and am unable to breastfeed. Breastfeeding is not an option for all.' She also urged legislators to cap the cost of formula, saying: '$50+ for a 14oz can is insanity and should be illegal. Babies need fed!!! Inflation is up ones no one's wage is up to match it.' 'This is what America looks like!': GOP Rep. fumes at 'pallets' of baby formula being sent to border centers for illegal migrants while American parents desperately search barren grocery store shelves Republicans are sounding the alarm after discovering baby formula is being sent to border facilities while American mothers are facing empty shelves amid massive shortages. GOP Representative Kat Cammack tweeted Thursday two images, one showing full shelves of baby formula and food from a processing center at the southern border and another showing empty shelves where baby formula was supposed to be at an American grocery store. 'The first photo is from this morning at the Ursula Processing Center at the U.S. border. Shelves and pallets packed with baby formula,' Cammack wrote. 'The second is from a shelf right here at home. Formula is scarce.' 'This is what America last looks like,' she added. This comes as President Joe Biden prepares to sit down with manufacturers and retailers to address the baby formula shortage as mothers and fathers scramble to find food for their infants. More than 100 House Republicans are demanding that the administration to do more to address the crisis. 'This issue is a matter of life and death, and it is time this administration treats it with the appropriate urgency it deserves,' the GOP lawmakers said in the letter to the president on Wednesday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that there needs to be immediate action to address the baby formula shortage in the U.S., but Congress isn't holding hearings on the issue until the end of the month as mothers scramble to feed their babies. 'You know, everybody has suggestions about 'we make sure it never happens again.' And that's important,' she said during her weekly briefing Thursday. 'But right now, the baby's crying, the baby's hungry. We need to address it right now,' she added. 'And I think we have good focus on it.' Despite the calls for immediately figuring out the shortage, Democrats in Congress have not shown urgency in their policy - instead spending the week focusing on passing $40 billion in aid to Ukraine and pushing for action on codifying Roe v. Wade. 'For a long time now Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, of the Appropriations Committee... has been addressing this issue,' Pelosi said on the topic of baby formula shortage. 'And when I say addressing that includes investigating, looking for other possibilities because - in anticipation just to make sure that something like this would not happen.' 'And we look forward to what the President has to say,' she added, indicating that action won't come from Congress until a White House plan is laid out. Biden will make his most visible move to try to tackle the nationwide infant formula shortage by meeting with retailers and manufacturers to try to find a way out of the crisis. The White House is also expected to announce new administrative steps to try to get more formula onto store shelves. The move comes as product recalls, supply chain shortages, and other factors have set off a scramble by some parents to locate enough formula to feed their young children. The Virginia firm Datasembly released a report revealing a nationwide out-of-stock rate of 43 per cent for formula, putting low income families and those with special needs at risk. Lawmakers are also pressing for action, but have scheduled hearings that don't start for weeks as the severe shortage continues. Abbott Nutrition announced it would be able to restart production at its Michigan plant, which was shuttered after a February recall. It will be six to eight weeks until it can start delivering product to store shelves, the company said Thursday.  According to a White House official, 'President Biden will speak with retailers and infant formula manufacturers to receive an update on efforts to make infant formula supply more available to American families. Later this afternoon, the White House will announce additional actions the Administration is taking to address this issue. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill will hold a hearing in two weeks on infant formula shortages, the House Energy and Commerce Committee said on Wednesday, as it called the situation 'increasingly alarming.' The House of Representatives panel, which is scheduled to meet May 25, did not name any company executives or other witnesses, but said it would release more details before the meeting. The hearing will focus on the shortage's causes, efforts to increase production, and what action is needed 'to ensure access to safe formula across the nation,' the committee chair, Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said in a statement. 'The nationwide infant formula shortages are increasingly alarming and demand Congress' immediate attention,' he said.  White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday also said it was a top priority to ensure that baby formula is available amid the shortage. 'This is an urgent issue that the FDA as you all know and the White House is working 24/7 to address they are committed to pulling every lever and are ready to making progress and getting more supply onto the market,' she said.  Pallone said lawmakers stood ready to work with President Joe Biden's administration to resolve the shortage, although it is unclear what specific steps Congress or the White House can take to boost supplies near-term. Meanwhile, Sen. Mitt Romney slammed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 'risking the lives of infants across the nation' by forcing America's biggest baby formula plant to stay closed while desperate parents scramble to feed their children. 'The responsibility falls on the FDA and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to protect infant health by ensuring they have access to safe formula,' Romney penned Tuesday in a letter to FDA Commissioner Robert Califf and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. 'Given the serious implications of the current shortage on infant health, I am deeply concerned about the apparent lack of an effective mitigation strategy and urge both agencies to move as fast as possible to safely resolve this situation.' Romney wants the agencies to do more to ensure the availability of baby formula, citing 'serious implications of the current shortage on infant health,' and asked for an update on the investigation into the alleged contaminated formula that forced the recall and shutdown of the Abbott Laboratories plant in Sturgis, Michigan. The plant ceased operation nearly three months ago after a bacterial infection caused deaths of two children and other serious illnesses. Abbott has since denied its plant is responsible for the deaths. The manufacturer also issued a nationwide recall on its powder baby formulas in February, exacerbating months of spot shortages at pharmacies and supermarkets. Now, pediatricians, healthcare experts and politicians are urging the FDA to reopen the plant and distribute Abbott's formula to families in need.  'There's still some risk from the formula because we know there are problems at the plant and FDA hasn't identified a root cause,' said Sarah Sorscher of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. 'But it's worth releasing because these infants might die without it.'  The FDA issued a statement to DailyMail.com on Tuesday, alleging it was working with U.S. manufacturers to increase their output and streamlining paperwork to allow more imports.  An Abbott spokesperson also confirmed the manufacturer was 'doing everything we can to address the infant formula supply shortage,' which includes priorities production of formula products and importing products from the company's FDA-registered facility in Ireland on a daily basis. The company said on Wednesday it could resume infant formula production within two weeks at its Michigan plant as it works with the FDA. From then, it would take six to eight weeks before the product is available on store shelves. Sen. Romney argues the FDA and USDA have a 'responsibility' to mitigate the impacts of the shortage. 'Please provide a comprehensive update on the progress of the investigation, estimated timeline to completion, efforts to coordinate with other federal agencies, including the USDA, and any other authorities that may be necessary to help relieve the formula shortage,' he urged.  'Between the risk of ingesting contaminated formula, and the risk of malnutrition from an inability to receive said formula, the FDA is an exceedingly difficult position protecting infant health.  'I appreciate the FDA's efforts to support case-by-case release of essential product, but the pace of release is far slower than demand felt across our nation. In its attempt to balance safety from contaminated product and safe infant development through formula access, FDA is achieving neither objective.' The Republican legislator also criticized the quality of the FDA's inspections at the Abbott plant, citing instances of possible contamination dating back to 2019. 'I am alarmed to see documented instances of non-descript contamination in September 24, 2021, and inadequate sample testing to prove formula products met microbiological quality standards in 2019,' Romney wrote. 'This documentation suggests FDA's routine inspection authority is insufficient to meet consumer safety demands, yet its hammer of near-shutdowns of facilities causes a ripple effect throughout the country.'  The FDA, which claims Abbott failed to maintain sanitary conditions and procedures at its Michigan manufacturing plant that was linked to a cluster of infant Cronobacter sakazaki infections, published its initial inspection findings in March 2022. The findings showed the facility didn't maintain clean surfaces used in producing and handling the powdered formula. Additionally, inspectors found a history of contamination with the bacteria, including eight instances between fall 2019 and February of this year.  An Abbott spokesperson told DailyMail.com Tuesday that 'thorough investigation' by the FDA and Abbott revealed 'infant formula produced at our Sturgis facility is not the likely source of infection in the reported cases and that there was not an outbreak caused by products from the facility'.  Regardless, Romney has questioned the FDA's inspection process and is demanding to know what steps were taken to ensure the 'contaminated products did not leave the facility' after initial inspections in 2019 and 2021. Abbott Laboratories, the biggest baby formula supplier in the U.S., ceased production at its Michigan plant in February 2022 amid reports of fatal bacterial infections. A timeline of events shows reveals the shut down was the plant had previously been under scrutiny by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  September 2021: The FDA conducted a four-day inspection of the Abbott Laboratories plant in Sturgis, Michigan. The inspection report revealed the plant 'did not maintain' clean and sanitary conditions in at least one building that manufactured, processed, packaged or held baby formula. FDA officials also observed poor hand washing among Abbott plant staff who 'worked directly with infant formula.' The FDA also noted an instance of improper equipment maintenance and temperature control.  October 2021: A whistleblower sends the FDA a 34-page document outlining potential concerns with the Sturgis plant.  The document, which was made public by Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro in April 2022, was written by a former plant employee.  The employee accused the plant of lax cleaning practices, falsifying records, releasing untested infant formula, and hiding information during an FDA audit in 2019, among other issues.  January - March 2022: The FDA conducted multiple inspections at the Sturgis plant over the course of three months in 2022. A ten-page inspection report revealed multiple violations at the facility. The agency alleged the plant failed to ensure that all surfaces that contact infant formula were maintained to prevent cross-contamination. The report states the facility 'did not establish a system of process controls' to ensure the baby formula 'does not become adulterated due to the presence of microorganisms in the formula or the processing environment.' Officials also alleged the plant failed to disclose in an investigation report whether a health hazard existed at the facility. Additionally, the report stated plant workers were did not wear the 'necessary protective material' when working directly with infant formula. February 17: U.S. health officials urgently warn parents against using three popular baby formulas manufactured at the Abbott plant in Michigan. Investigators claim the products were recently linked to bacterial contamination after an infant died and three others fell ill. Abbott voluntarily recalled several major brands and shut down its Sturgis plant.  The FDA also said it is investigating four reports of infants who were hospitalized after consuming the formula, including one who died. February 28: Abbott Laboratories expanded its recall of Similac baby formulas after a second infant who was exposed to the powdered baby formula died. April 15: Abbott releases a statement alleging it is working closely with the FDA to restart operations at the Sturgis plant.  Week of April 24: The nationwide share of out-of-stock baby formula hit 40 percent. Texas, Tennessee, Missouri, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota, seemingly hardest hit by the shortages, reported out-of-stock rates of about 50 percent. May 10: Abbott releases a statement to DailyMail.com claiming 'thorough investigation' by the FDA and Abbott revealed 'infant formula produced at our Sturgis facility is not the likely source of infection in the reported cases and that there was not an outbreak caused by products from the facility'. Abbott claims they are 'working closely with the FDA to restart operations' at the plant, with the spokesperson noting: 'We continue to make progress on corrective actions and will be implementing additional actions as we work toward addressing items related to the recent recall'. The FDA told DailyMail.com it was holding discussions with 'Abbott and other manufacturers to increase production of different specialty and metabolic products' but refused to say when the Sturgis plant could reopen. Sen. Mitt Romney issued a letter to the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) urging leaders to address the formula shortage and work to prevent future threats to infant health. May 11: Lawmakers on Capitol Hill announce plans to hold a hearing in two weeks on infant formula shortages. Abbott announced it would take up to ten weeks for the company to get baby formula to retailers once the Sturgis plant reopens. Abbott also said: 'After a thorough review of all available data, there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses.' Nationwide about 40 percent of large retail stores are out of stock of baby formula, up from 31 percent in mid-April, according to Datasembly, a data analytics firm.  More than half of U.S. states are seeing out-of-stock rates between 40 percent and 50 percent, according to the firm, which collects data from 11,000 locations.  White House press secretary Jenn Psaki said Monday the Food and Drug Administration was 'working around the clock to address any possible shortages,' however shelves across the country meant to carry formula remain largely barren.  Retailers including Target, CVS and Walgreens have begun limiting formula purchases to three containers per customer.  For now, pediatricians and health workers are urging parents who can't find formula to contact food banks or doctor's offices. They warn against watering down formula to stretch supplies or using online DIY recipes. 'For babies who are not being breastfed, this is the only thing they eat,' said Dr. Steven Abrams, of the University of Texas, Austin. 'So it has to have all of their nutrition and, furthermore, it needs to be properly prepared so that it's safe for the smallest infants.' The shortages are especially dangerous for infants who require specialty formulas due to food allergies, digestive problems and other conditions. 'Unfortunately, many of those very specialized formulas are only made in the United States at the factory that had the recall, and that's caused a huge problem for a relatively small number of infants,' Abrams said. After hearing concerns from parents, the FDA said last month that Abbott could begin releasing some specialty formulas not affected by the recalls 'on a case-by-case basis.' The company is providing them free of charge, in coordination with physicians and hospitals. Food safety advocates say the FDA made the right call in releasing the formula, but that parents should talk to their pediatricians before using it. 'Always talk with your pediatrician if you have concerns about your baby's nutrition and feeding your baby,' Dr. Sarah Abrams, of Akron Children's Hospital in Ohio, told Fox News. 'Switch to other formula brands or types of formula,' she advised to parents struggling to find product, 'but talk to your pediatrician first, especially if your baby must use a hydrolyzed or amino acid-based formula.' The pediatrician also shared that due to the Abbott recall, parents have been fearful of that other brands of formula may have been contaminated. 'I have been told that due to the recall, [parents] were afraid to use the formula they had, even if it wasn't one that was recalled,' she explained. 'And if they do find formula, they worry about the limits of how much formula they can buy at one time. 'They are calling our office and we are helping them by reaching out to local formula representatives.' Despite the results of the investigation and pressure from experts and concerned parents, it remains unclear when Abbott's Michigan plant might reopen. The FDA said the company is still working 'to rectify findings related to the processes, procedures and conditions' but refused to say when the plant can resume operations. Other infant formula makers are 'meeting or exceeding capacity levels to meet current demand,' the agency stated Tuesday. Among other steps, the FDA said it was waiving enforcement of minor product labeling issues to increase availability of both U.S. and imported products. 'We recognize that many consumers have been unable to access infant formula and critical medical foods they are accustomed to using and are frustrated by their inability to do so. We are doing everything in our power to ensure there is adequate product available where and when they need it,' FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, M.D. told DailyMail.com in a statement. 'Ensuring the availability of safe, sole-source nutrition products like infant formula is of the utmost importance to the FDA. Our teams have been working tirelessly to address and alleviate supply issues and will continue doing everything within our authority to ensure the production of safe infant formula products.'  Baby formula is particularly vulnerable to disruptions because just a handful of companies account for almost the entire U.S. supply, analysts allege. Industry executives say the constraints began last year as the COVID-19 pandemic led to disruptions in ingredients, labor and transportation. Supplies were further squeezed by parents stockpiling during lockdowns. Then in February, Abbott recalled several major brands and shut down its Sturgis, Michigan, factory when federal officials concluded four babies suffered bacterial infections after consuming formula from the facility. Two of the infants died. When FDA inspectors visited the plant in March they found lax safety protocols and traces of the bacteria on several surfaces. None of the bacterial strains matched those collected from the infants, however, and the FDA hasn't offered an explanation for how the contamination occurred. An Abbott spokesperson told DailyMail.com Wednesday: 'After a thorough review of all available data, there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses.'  Abbott claims they are 'working closely with the FDA to restart operations' at the plant, with the spokesperson on Tuesday noting: 'We continue to make progress on corrective actions and will be implementing additional actions as we work toward addressing items related to the recent recall'. Meanwhile, parents are across the nation are issuing alarming calls for help as they try to find ways to nourish their children.  Laura Stewart, a 52-year-old mother of three who lives just north of Springfield, Missouri, has been struggling for several weeks to find formula for her 10-month-old daughter, Riley. Riley normally gets a brand of Abbott's Similac designed for children with sensitive stomachs. Last month, she instead used four different brands. 'She spits up more. She's just more cranky. She is typically a very happy girl,' Stewart said. 'When she has the right formula, she doesn't spit up. She's perfectly fine.' A small can costs $17 to $18 and lasts three to five days, Stewart said. Like many Americans, Stewart relies on WIC - a federal program similar to food stamps that serves mothers and children - to afford formula for her daughter. Abbott's recall wiped out many WIC-covered brands, though the program is now allowing substitutions. Brian Dittmeier, Senior Director of Public Policy at the WIC Association told DailyMail.com in a statement Tuesday that the 'unprecedented scope of this infant formula recall has serious consequences for babies and new parents.' 'Assurances from manufacturers that production has ramped up have not yet translated to new product on the shelf. Each day that this crisis continues, parents grow more anxious and desperate to find what they need to feed their infants,' the statement said. 'Unlike other food recalls, shortages in the infant formula supply affects a major - or even exclusive - source of nutrition for babies. Inadequate nutrition could have long-term health implications for babies. Supply shortages are particularly acute for infants who require specialty formulas to address allergies, gastrointestinal issues, or metabolic disorders; adequate substitutes with other brands may not be easily identifiable. 'Every day, we hear from parents who are hurt, angry, anxious, and scared. The lives of their infants are on the line. It is time for answers and accountability as we all work to improve the supply and ease the worries of parents enduring this national crisis.'", "12eb08aadedba580fa86badfa3480d39ebe34b50fb9a990c463a1321": "Grim before and after photos reveal just how devastating a Wednesday night California wildfire was, as up to 20 multi-million dollar mansions were reduced to rubble in just a matter of hours. The blaze - dubbed the Coastal Fire - ignited near a water treatment facility in Aliso Woods Canyon - between Laguna Niguel and Laguna Beach in Orange County - at 2.44pm and swept up steep terrain amid strong gales. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but on Wednesday night the local electricity company revealed that there was 'circuit activity occurring close in time to the reported time of the fire,' as residents say power went out before the flames erupted. The blaze quickly reached the gated community at Coronado Pointe - where properties sell for between $1million and $10million - and the 30300 block of La Vue near the Summit Trail.  It then ripped across the area and began looming over homes on Coronado Pointe. As the first homes began to burn, the embers were cast into neighboring homes, causing a devastating domino effect. At least 20 homes in the exclusive enclave have already been engulfed by the fire and a further 100 were potentially in the wildfire's path, Orange County Sheriff's Capt. Virgil Asuncion said. Nine hundred homes remained under evacuation orders Thursday morning as flames continued to ignite. A state of emergency has now been declared, as the Coastal Fire consumed nearly 200 acres and firefighters continued to fight the flames.  There is no word on how much of the fire has already been contained. But at least one firefighter suffered a medical emergency as he battled the flames, officials announced on Thursday, and was brought to the hospital. He is in stable condition. Meanwhile, photos show that one seven-bedroom, eight-bathroom home, which was listed for sale on Zillow for $9.89 million was completely gutted in the aftermath. The 10,000 square foot home at 5 Vista Court in Laguna Niguel, California had boasted its own 'children's wing' with a game room and study room, as well as a two-story bedroom and a 'wellness wing to house your meditation room, gym and very own Pilates studio with sauna and steam room.' It also included a separate outdoor pool overlooking the California mountains and Laguna Beach, as well as a four-car garage and a home theater. Property records show that it is currently owned by a shell corporation, which purchased the luxurious mansion for $6.275 million in September 2020. Firefighters were seen still trying to quell the flames at the mansion early Thursday morning.  Nearby, Lynn and Keith Morey's five-bedroom, four-and-a-half bathroom home with a two story library and office burned to the ground, less than one year after the couple lost their business to another fire. They had left the home earlier in the morning, ABC 7 reports, and they did not have time to grab any of their belongings. As a result, Lynn lost the only photos she had left of her sister, who had passed away four years earlier. 'I'm more in shock than anything else,' Lynn said Wednesday night. A GoFundMe has now been set to help the couple rebuild. It was then shared on Facebook, by Lynne's niece, Heather Balaban, who wrote: 'My aunt Lynn and her husband Keith are the sweetest, most giving people I know. 'Their mission in life is [to] help heal others,' she explained, noting: 'They invite people in their home to stay with them all the time. 'Unfortunately, last night their home burnt to the ground, and they had no time to grab any of their belongings because they were evacuated in Laguna Niguel.' As of 1.30pm EST on Thursday, the online fundraiser had raised $1,550 from seven donors to help the family.  Another $6.6 million four-bedroom, seven bathroom mansion at 35 Coronado Pointe had also lost its roof entirely to flames as firefighters battled to save the walls and neighboring properties. Explosions were heard coming from one home - believed to be the sound of ammunition detonating. It remains unclear exactly how many homes were destroyed as of Thursday morning, when assessment teams were entering the area.  Smoke warnings remained in effect, and firefighters will likely remain on the scene through Friday, with Michelle Summers telling DailyMail.com her husband, who is a captain with the Ocean County Fire Association, 'it's the worst he's ever been on and he's got over 30 years.' Laguna Beach has been home over the years to famous faces including Diane Keaton, Bette Midler screenwriter and producer Ryan Murphy, and Hollywood's Golden Age star, Bette Davis. 'It takes your breath away,' Julianna Shapiro, 52, told the LA Times as she watched her community burn. 'It's just so hard to watch, but I can't help not watch it. It's our neighbors losing their homes. You feel so hopeless.'  The Federal Emergency Management Agency has now approved federal funding to combat the growing fire. 'This support will ensure that state and local authorities have the resources they need to continue addressing this emergency to save lives and homes in our community,' Rep. Michelle Steel tweeted on Thursday. Hundreds of people were forced to evacuate from their homes in the area of Coronado Pointe, Vista Courte, Pacific Island Drive, Via Las Rosa, and the Ranch Golf Course and Resort at around 4pm. Sheriff's deputies ran between each house to tell people to leave. But Kevin Kothlow said he decided to stay, as he has fire fighting experience. He told the LA Times how he walked down a trail and watched as the fire spread. 'It literally just ran up the hill,' he said. 'I saw it hit the palm trees and as soon as I saw that I knew those houses were gone. You could see the embers blowing through the air.' Among those evacuated were Cheryl Flohr and her husband Mark, whose 48,500-square-foot home is in Palmea, the neighborhood next to the badly damaged Coronado Pointe. 'Fred Minegar, the mayor in 2020, immediately engaged and drove up and down the streets honking letting residents know,' Cheryl Flohr told The Orange County Register. 'They were so ready for us. I'm proud of my community and Laguna Niguel.' Mark Flohr told the paper he knew there was a fire when he heard aircraft overhead and then saw smoke. Then he drove over to a vacant area overlooking the steep canyons above The Ranch resort in Laguna Beach and saw the flames. Not long after, the couple got a knock on the door asking them to evacuate. Using a list they created more than a decade ago, they carried out what was important to them - photo albums, hard drives, devices and charging cords plus irreplaceable personal items. 'I brought a glass doll head my mother played with 100 years ago,' said Cheryl. Mark brought some old engineering tools and century-old books. The couple planned to stay with friends and family on Wednesday night. 'We came here first because we wanted to be where the information was,' Cheryl said. Sara Nuss-Galles also told DailyMail.com she and her husband, as well as their cats, are staying with friends a few miles from their home after they were forced to evacuate. They were able to grab important papers, passports, medications, toiletries and clothes, she said, as they keep a list of items they would need in case of an evacuation on their refrigerator.  Her house is now blocked off from traffic, she said, 'but apparently apart from ash, smoke and embers, the street is OK.' Most of the destruction, she said, was just about a quarter mile away from where she and her husband live, and they 'often walk on the ridge where so many houses burned. 'It's a beautiful hike and outlook,' Nuss-Galles said of the area, adding that the situation is 'heartbreaking for the people [who] live there.'   She said she is just grateful 'for the amazing firefighters themselves staying and keeping us all safe.' Residents near Moulton Meadows and Balbo Nyes were also advised to be prepared to evacuate at a moment's notice, but the warning was lifted before 10pm as officials said there is no immediate threat to the area. Laguna Beach high school had also been evacuated, and shelters have been set up in the area.  The fire spread quickly because wind had driven up embers into palm trees, attics and dense, dry brush on slopes and steep canyons that hadn't burned for decades, said Britain Fennessy, chief of the Orange County Fire Authority. Fennessy said climate change has made even small fires that once would have been easily contained into extreme threats to life and property throughout the West. Fennessy told ABC 7 LA TV his team was trying to save as many homes as they could. 'It's all about defending the homes that have not already burned,' Fennessy said from the scene. 'The firefighters behind me are really putting on an aggressive fight.' Fennessy said at a press conference on Wednesday night he expected winds to die down after sunset, which would help slow the spread. He said there were no other major fires in Southern California, enabling firefighters from the area to concentrate their resources on Laguna Niguel. The hilltop city of about 65,000 people is just inland from the coastal city of Laguna Beach about 50 miles south of Los Angeles. Dry brush covers the surrounding hills and canyons, as California experiences historic drought.  'Unfortunately I think this is what we're going to be experiencing over the next several weeks and years,' said Fennessy. The vegetation is so dry it is not taking much for the fire to take off running and burn very quickly.'   Mike Garcia, the Laguna Beach fire chief, said: 'It was a wind-driven fire. And since it started around 3pm on Wednesday it's gone eastward. 'It's becoming a pretty big fire, burning several homes in the city of Laguna Niguel. I want to tell our community that the city of Laguna Beach is safe. We don't expect any changes.  'But we want all of our residents to remain vigilant, be prepared, be aware.' He said they would notify residents of any changes, but people should be prepared to 'react quickly'. Ground and air crews from the Orange County Fire Authority and Laguna Beach Fire Department were working to extinguish flames moving uphill through light and moderately dense vegetation. Winds gusting up to 20 mph were fanning the flames, and relative humidity in the area was measured at 52 percent, said Mark Moede, from the National Weather Service. 'Gusts were up to 25 mph when the fire started,' Moede said at about 5pm. 'It will stay breezy for the next hour or so, but should drop-off as the sun drops below the horizon.' The last major fire in the area was the Emerald fire on February 24. The earlier fire grew to about 150 acres before it was extinguished. The first three months of 2022 have been the driest on record.   Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, responded on Tuesday by pledging to spend $100 million on a statewide advertising campaign to encourage water conservation.  The campaign will include traditional radio and television spots while also paying people with large followings on social media to urge others to save water.  He also promised to spend an $211 million to conserve more water in state government buildings by replacing plumbing fixtures and irrigation controls. In Los Angeles - the second most populous city in the U.S. - Mayor Eric Garcetti said residents and businesses would have to reduce outdoor landscape watering from three days per week to two.  Irrigation makes up 35 percent of the city's water use. Urban water use accounts for a relatively small percentage of California's overall water use when compared to agriculture. But the state's farmers have been suffering, too, as state and federal officials have reduced water allocations to zero in some places. Demand for non-agriculture water is typically low in March, which comes near the end of the state's rainy season. It can sometimes rain so much in March that it makes up for the rest of the year, a phenomenon officials have dubbed the 'March miracle.' But California got just 1 inch of precipitation in March while the temperatures were 3 degrees warmer than usual, further increasing water demand. A series of April storms have improved things slightly since March.  Still, most of the state's reservoirs are well below their historic averages.  The reservoirs depend on melted snow from the Sierra Nevada to replenish them for the dry summer months. But the statewide snowpack was at just 27 percent of its historic average as of April 1. 'This is what we have. This is what we're going to get. We can't expect anything significant past this date,' said Jeanine Jones, manager for interstate resources with the California Department of Water Resources. State officials said 20 percent of the wells they monitor are reporting all-time low water levels, while nearly half of them have less than 10 percent of their historic averages.  In some cases, the state is helping to haul water to small communities that don't have access to it. State officials said they were assisting 687 households through a small community drought relief program. Some larger communities were also in danger. Lindsay, a city of about 13,000 people in California's Central Valley, was projected to run out of water on July 1.  Federal officials approved an additional allocation for the city, which they now say will have enough water to last through February - provided they continue to conserve.", "dc1161723a6758bb3ef23914a9726038de6002ef0a6ab36ffcfd757d": "Foreign criminals could be forced to pay for their own immigration detention costs under a new plan by Scott Morrison. The prime minister has drawn up a 15-page 'plan for protecting our borders' after intelligence agencies sounded the alarm over an increase in people smuggling. Joint Agency Taskforce Operation Sovereign Borders warned the country could experience an increase in the number of boats illegally crossing the Indo-Pacific. The OSB taskforce believes the 'opportunistic maritime people smuggling ventures may look to test Australia's deterrence, disruption and response capabilities'. Taxpayers are currently forking out $456 a day to pay for the accommodation, food and healthcare of each foreign criminal. The plan put forward by the Coalition to make foreign criminals foot the bill could save taxpayers $216million a year.  Boosting border staff numbers, increasing support for refugees and upholding all OSB enforcement powers are among the changes included in theplan. The Greens released its immigration policy on Thursday revealing its intention to scrap the Australian Border Force, end boat turnbacks and close offshore detention. Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews warned the drastic approach could force Labor to soften its policies in the case of a hung parliament. 'Labor's promise to abolish temporary protection visas, a key pillar of Operation Sovereign Borders, demonstrates the clear choice at this election between strong borders and weak borders,' Ms Andrews said.  'The Greens' policy to abolish the Border Force is a very dangerous policy that would undermine everything we have achieved to make our country safer - and we know the risk is that it's a policy Labor would have to bargain on in a hung parliament.' A senior government source warned people smugglers were waiting for a change of government to ramp up their illegal operations.  'There's a high risk that they're gearing up for another crack at the people-smuggling trade if the government changes,' they told The Australian.  Opposition leader Anthony Albanese has insisted his government will maintain a tough stance against people smugglers and keep offshore detention centres open. Mr Albanese doubled down on his border policy during the final leader's debate on Wednesday. 'The key to keeping our borders strong are the elements of the plan that would turn back boats, which we support, offshore processing, which we support, and settlement in third countries, which we support,' he said.  'Anyone who comes by boat will not get any visa here in Australia, they won't be allowed to settle here in Australia. We have the same position on all of those issues.'

Local members have been instructed they should not speak publicly about his beer and curry 'party' during lockdown. Durham Constabulary announced last week that it was launching a probe into the gathering on April 30 last year after receiving 'significant new information'.  At the time, indoor socialising was banned. The move followed a string of revelations in the Daily Mail about what really happened when Sir Keir gathered with MPs and officials in Durham Miners Hall in the run-up to last year's local elections. Sir Keir has said he will 'do the right thing and step down' if police issue him with a fixed-penalty notice over the event.  But he has not said whether he will quit if Durham Constabulary finds he breached lockdown laws but sticks to its policy of not issuing Covid fines retrospectively. In an email to members this week, Chris Turner, the secretary of the local Labour party in the City of Durham, warned they could be contacted by the Press.  He told them: 'If you are contacted by a journalist, I would advise you make no response. Politely decline to speak to them.' Meanwhile, the BBC admitted it had been hit with complaints for giving 'insufficient coverage' to Beergate. The broadcaster released a statement on the criticism yesterday, which it traditionally does when it has received more than 100 complaints about an issue. It defended its reporting, saying the story had been covered 'across our news and current affairs programmes'.", "3f5a0adddfbdd49bf022466d1d80cc3d6091e3647f660962de2e6a1f": "White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that the administration backs Finland and Sweden applying to join the powerful NATO alliance. 'We would support a NATO application by Finland and Sweden, yes,' Psaki said when asked directly at her daily White House press briefing. She was less direct when asked to draw distinctions between those nations and Ukraine, whose own application was put into limbo but is now being aided by billions in U.S. aid as it seeks to repel Russia's invasion. 'We know that they have been close and valued defense partners,' she said, pointing to a 'range of requirements' for nations seeking to join the powerful military alliance. Those include 'addressing a range of issues like corruption and how you would participate in the defense of the collective NATO Alliance. But I will let them speak to that. We of course support the NATO's open door policy and the aspirations of any country to apply to join. But I think this speaks to our long standing relationship and military partnerships with Finland and Sweden,' Psaki said. Asked about how Russia might respond - in the wake of the Kremlin's outburst at the move, Psaki took to quoting Finland's president. 'As it relates to Russia, you cause this look at the mirror,' she said.  'NATO is a defensive alliance. It's not an offensive Alliance. Both Finland and Sweden are close and valued defense partners of the United States and NATO. They're thriving democracies. They've worked closely with NATO for years. There's no aggressive intent from NATO, from the United States from Finland or Sweden ... to Russia,' she said. 'This is President Putin who caused this. Look at the mirror,' she concluded.  Russian state TV has accused the US of erecting a 'new iron curtain' in Europe in a furious response to Finland announcing its intention to join NATO, as the Kremlin's spokesman it will make the world less 'stable.' This morning, president Sauli Niinisto and prime minister Sanna Marin said they want to join the security alliance 'without delay', with Sweden set to follow suit within days, drastically ramping up tensions between Russia and the West.  A senior Russian leader and the Kremlin had previously threatened it would secure 'the entire destruction' of the country' and 'the most undesirable consequences', and today said it would 'be forced to take retaliatory steps', both 'military-technical and other' against the 'threat'. 'As we have said many times before, NATO expansion does not make the world more stable and secure,' said Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov, one of the country's top officials who fall under U.S. and European sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He was coy about how Russia would respond. 'It will depend on what this expansion process will entail, how far and how close to our borders the military infrastructure will move,' he said. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Finland would be 'warmly welcomed.' 'This is a sovereign decision by Finland, which NATO fully respects. Should Finland decide to apply, they would be warmly welcomed into NATO, and the accession process would be smooth and swift,' Stoltenberg said. 'Finland is one of NATO's closest partners, a mature democracy, a member of the European Union, and an important contributor to Euro-Atlantic security,' he continued. The decision is a spectacular backfire for Putin who invaded Ukraine in part through fears of NATO expansion, with the Western pact's presence on Russia's borders now set to double from 754 miles to 1,584 miles. When asked what he would say to Russia, Niinisto replied: 'You caused this. Look in the mirror.'  In the latest of Russia's brandishing of nuclear threats, Putin ally and ex-president Dmitry Medvedev warned NATO support for Ukraine risks nuclear war.   Medvedev wrote on Telegram:  'NATO countries pumping weapons into Ukraine, training troops to use western equipment, sending in mercenaries and the exercises of alliance countries near our borders increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between NATO and Russia. 'Such a conflict always has the risk of turning into a full-fledged nuclear war,' he added. Now serving as deputy chairman of the influential Kremlin Security Council, Medvedev was President of Russia from 2008 to 2012 while Putin was term-limited. Medvedev appointed Putin prime minister during that period. When Putin was allowed to become president once again, Medvedev stepped aside. After Finland's announcement, Russian state TV's Olga Skabeyeva said: 'The main beneficiary here is America and Biden. And the main aim is a new iron curtain from the Barents to the Black Sea.'  Peskov said the move was 'definitely' a threat to Russia and warned it would make Europe more unstable.  He said Finland had made 'unfriendly steps' against Russia and it was a cause for regret and a reason to impose a symmetrical response.  Sweden is expected to follow Finland with its own bid which could come as soon as next week, with a parliament debate on Monday followed by a special cabinet meeting where the formal decision to apply will be taken, Daily Expressen said. A special committee will announce Finland's decision on a membership bid on Sunday although it could take until October before the country is formally admitted to the pact. The major policy shift which completely rewrites Europe's post WWII alignment comes a day after Boris Johnson signed security pacts with Helsinki and Stockholm pledging Britain would come to their aid if they come under Russian attack.  In their statement today, Niinisto and Marin said: 'Now that the moment of decision-making is near, we state our equal views, also for information to the parliamentary groups and parties.  'NATO membership would strengthen Finland's security. As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense alliance. 'Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay. 'We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.' Finland, which shares an 830-mile border and a difficult past with Russia, has previously remained outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to maintain friendly relations with its eastern neighbor. Earlier this morning, former prime minister Alexander Stubb said: 'I have been waiting for this day for 30 years. 'Announcement on Finnish NATO membership imminent.' Sweden is expected to imminently follow Finland with an application to join the Western military pact. The Nordic nations have been rattled by Moscow's war against its pro-Western neighbour, which has bolstered domestic support for joining the alliance - and the security that membership would provide. After today's announcement, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the eventual membership process would be 'smooth and swift'. 'This is a sovereign decision by Finland, which NATO fully respects. Should Finland decide to apply, they would be warmly welcomed into NATO,' Stoltenberg said. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also said he will push for a quick admission process. 'Denmark will of course warmly welcome Finland to NATO. (It) will strengthen NATO and our common security,' Frederiksen said on Twitter. 'Denmark will do everything for a quick admission process after the formal application.' Meanwhile Volodymyr Zelensky 'commended' Finland's readiness to apply to join the NATO alliance in a phone call with Niinisto. 'We also discussed Ukraine's European integration. And - defense interaction,' he wrote on Twitter. Both Finland and Sweden have been militarily non-aligned since WWII. Sweden maintained its policy of neutrality - which had begun in the early 19th century - throughout the war wanting to avoid being drawn into a conflict that was engulfing the nearby powers of Germany and the Soviet Union. Instead, Sweden profited from its neutrality by exporting iron ore to the Nazis and sharing military intelligence with the Allies and training their refugee soldiers.  Meanwhile Finland changed sides in the conflict, first being invaded by Joseph Stalin and assisting the Nazis, before fighting against Hitler's troops. When NATO was formed in 1949 for a Western military alliance, Sweden decided not to join and continue its neutrality, introducing a security policy that secured its non-alignment in peace and neutrality in war.  In 1994, Stockholm decided to join the NATO programme Partnership for Peace (PfP), aimed to build trust between member states and other European countries, but until now it has not signalled a desire to fully join the alliance. Finland is also a PfP member but has similarly stated its desire to remain neutral since the war. The EU member state was part of the Russian Empire and won independence during the 1917 Russian revolution but it nearly lost it fighting the Soviet Union in World War Two.  Having been invaded by Russia in 1939 and sharing a long border with the superpower, Finland wanted to stay out of future conflicts, giving it the freedom to maintain a strong relationship with Moscow and the West while enjoying a free market economy.  Any NATO expansion is bound to spark anger from Vladimir Putin, who has warned Sweden and Finland against joining. The Russian tyrant has historically pushed back at any eastward expansion of the alliance and has strongly condemned any notions of Ukraine joining. He claimed Ukraine's closeness with the West was one reason behind his invasion. Moscow lawmaker Vladimir Dzhabarov recently warned Finland that a formal application would mean 'the destruction of the country', while another Kremlin spokesman Alexander Grushko threatening 'the most undesirable consequences'.  But Moscow's mounting warnings and threatening rhetoric appear only to have strengthened Finland's and Sweden's resolve to join. It comes after Britain pledged yesterday to come to Sweden and Finland's aid should either of the countries come under Russian attack.  Boris Johnson signed security pacts with his Swedish and Finnish counterparts during visits to the countries on Wednesday. The pacts could see British troops sent to the two nations in the event of a Russian invasion from '21st century tyrant' Putin - who has threatened 'military and political consequences' should either country join the NATO alliance. Johnson said the countries must be free to decide whether to join NATO without 'fear of retaliation' in a stark message to Putin. The PM said the 'mutual security assurances' would see the countries involved come to each other's aid in the event of an attack. Asked whether British troops could be sent to Finland in the event of a Russian invasion, the PM said: 'Yes, we will come to each other's assistance including with military assistance.' He said the UK would be prepared to offer Sweden 'whatever Sweden requested', if Moscow followed through with threats of a military offensive. Speaking at a press conference in Helsinki alongside Niinisto, Johnson said the two countries would 'always come to one another's aid'. 'The security declaration, the solemn declaration we have signed today, ensures that our two nations can intensify our partnership and take it to unparalleled heights, both latitudinal and metaphorical,' he said. 'From the high north, to the Baltics and beyond, our armed forces will train, operate and exercise together, marrying our defence and security capabilities and formalising a pledge that we will always come to one another's aid. 'Because this is not a short-term stop gap, Sauli. 'This is not a short-term stop gap as you consider Nato membership, but an enduring assurance between two nations, an assurance that brings us ever closer as we face the challenges of today, the threats of tomorrow, side by side.' Iro Sarkka, a NATO expert from the University of Helsinki, told AFP before the announcement that Niinisto, who had refrained from revealing his stance on membership, had nonetheless dropped hints that he was leaning toward supporting a bid. 'The president no longer talks about the EU defence option or the role of Finland as the mediator between the East and the West,' she said. On Wednesday, the Finnish parliament's defence committee also concluded that membership of NATO would be the 'best option' for Finland's security, as the Russian invasion had eroded the security situation in Europe. More than 80 years ago, the small Finland took on the might of the Soviet Union when dictator Joseph Stalin ordered an invasion after its government refused to give up substantial territory. The Winter War of 1939-1940 - which began less than three months after the start of the Second World War - saw Finland's forces use innovative tactics to defy Russia's hopes for a quick, emphatic victory that could have landed Stalin control of the whole country. Instead, Soviet troops - who numbered around one million - were fiercely resisted for nearly three months, with dramatic photos showing how vehicles and equipment had to be abandoned in the face of the opposition and freezing conditions. In that time, Russia suffered more than 300,000 casualties - including 126,900 deaths - and lost up to 3,500 tanks and around 500 aircraft. By comparison, Finland lost 25,900 men out of an original force of around 300,000. Stories of Finnish heroics include that of a Finnish farmer who became the deadliest sniper in history after killing 505 Soviet troops. In the fighting, Finland also pioneered the use of the improvised grenade the Molotov cocktail, which was named after the Soviet Union's foreign minister. Ultimately however, the sheer numerical superiority of the Soviet Union's forces took its toll and Finland's government was eventually forced to sign a peace agreement that forced them to give up around ten per cent of their territory. Despite the defeat, Finland emerged with its sovereignty intact and its international reputation enhanced, whilst the Soviet Union was kicked out of the League of Nations and was condemned by other world leaders for the illegal invasion. Finnish sniper Simo Hayha emerged a hero after racking up the most sniper kills in the history of warfare. Aged 33 when the war broke out, Hayha quickly acquired a fearsome reputation, striking the enemy unseen and unheard from hidden positions up to 300 yards from his target. Nicknamed The White Death, Hayha was a prime target for the Soviets, who targeted him with mortars and heavy artillery to halt his killing spree, which once claimed 25 men in one day. Finland then allied with Nazi Germany against the Soviets in what was known as the Continuation War in 1941, with Helsinki trying to retake its lost territories. After a ceasefire was agreed in the Moscow Armistice in 1944, Finland was ordered to expel Nazi troops stationed in the country, prompting the Lapland War with Germany. At the Paris Peace Treaty, Finland was classified as an ally with Nazi Germany and ordered to pay reparations. The country then pursued a policy of neutrality, maintaining a free market economy and democracy despite enjoying a strong relationship with the Soviet Union.  A large majority in Finland's parliament backs membership. 'It is 100 per cent certain that Finland will apply and quite likely that it will be a member by the end of the year,' researcher Charly Salonius-Pasternak of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs told AFP before Thursday's announcement. For Finland, the next step is for the President and Ministerial Committee on Foreign and Security Policy - a body made up of the president, prime minister and up to six other cabinet ministers - to meet on Sunday. The committee will make the formal decision for Finland to submit an application, with the proposal then presented to parliament. After an official bid is submitted to the alliance, lawmakers in all 30 NATO member states would need to ratify its application, a process that can take months. Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said on Tuesday he believed Finland could be a full NATO member 'at the earliest' on October 1. 'The NATO secretary general has said that this process will take between four and 12 months. My own impression is that it might be closer to four months than 12 months,' Haavisto said. Swedish prime minister Magdalena Andersson said her country would be safer as a result of the mutual assistance agreement with the UK. 'Are we safer with this declaration? Yes we are. Of course this means something.' Finnish president Sauli Niinisto echoed the feeling later, saying the deal with the UK 'increases enormously Finnish security'.  He added he did not view joining the military alliance as a 'zero sum game'. 'Joining Nato would not be against anybody,' the Finnish president said.  Describing the declaration as a 'pivotal moment in our shared history', Mr Johnson added: 'It's pivotal because... the Russian invasion of Ukraine has changed the equation of European security and it has rewritten our reality and reshaped our future. 'We've seen the end of the post-Cold War period and the invasion of Ukraine sadly has opened a new chapter'. Finland shares a lengthy land border with Russia and is only about 250 miles from St Petersburg. Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine has led to a swift turnaround in Finnish and Swedish public opinion in favour of NATO membership, which until recently had little backing. A poll published Monday by Finnish public broadcaster Yle showed that a record 76 percent of Finns now support joining the alliance, up from the steady 20 to 30 percent registered in recent years. Public opinion has also surged in Sweden, albeit to lower levels, with around half of Swedes now in favour. Sweden's ruling Social Democratic Party said Monday it would announce its position on the NATO issue on May 15. A favourable stance would provide a clear parliamentary majority for an application. Elisabeth Braw, an expert on Nordic countries' defence at the American Enterprise Institute, told AFP that even though Stockholm appears more hesitant than Helsinki, she believes the two countries 'will do the application at the same time'. Traditionally accustomed to lengthy consensus-building debates on major issues, Sweden has been caught off-guard by Finland's swift turnaround. 'The Social Democrats in Sweden have always said: 'We'll think about this when Finland joins'... because they thought Finland would never join', Braw said. A policy reversal for the party, which ruled for an uninterrupted 40 years between the 1930s and 1970s, would be historic. Sweden is officially non-aligned militarily, although it is a NATO partner and abandoned its position of strict neutrality after the end of the Cold War. Finland has a long history with Russia. In 1917 it declared independence after 150 years of Russian rule. During World War II, its vastly outnumbered army fought off a Soviet invasion, before a peace deal saw it cede several border areas to the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, Finland remained neutral in exchange for guarantees from Moscow that it would not invade.  So the turnaround in sentiment on NATO would have been unthinkable just a few months ago. As recently as January, Marin said membership was 'very unlikely' during her term. But after two decades of public support for membership remaining steady at 20-30 per cent, the war caused a huge surge. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov euphemistically warned the move would 'not improve' the security situation in Europe. 'We have repeatedly said that the alliance remains a tool geared towards confrontation and its further expansion will not bring stability to the European continent,' Peskov said.  Any membership bid must be accepted by all 30 NATO states, a process that could take months although members have indicated they want to fast-track the bid.", "85d9368103ce1e36ca904a89399e2fb0185b619c386080ac2bd95c36": "An out-of-control pickup plowed through a fence and crashed into a Long Island home, narrowly missing a sleep 13-year-old boy.  Driver Blas Flores-Velasquez, 42, who has four prior arrests, was taken into custody and charged with intoxicated driving, leaving a scene of an incident, property damage, and operating a vehicle by an unlicensed driver two hours after crashing into a home on Long Island.  Velasquez, who police said was deported from the US in 2020, was driving on the Wantagh Parkway when he lost control and hit the Cypress Lane home shortly before 1am on Thursday.  Homeowner Thu Pham, 52, said she heard a 'boom' and went to check on her son Jayden Trinh.  'And then we just turned and got out the room and turn on the light,' she told ABC. 'I saw the whole door was gone. I went to my son's room and saw there was a hole.  'I didn't know there's a car that went through there. I went to see what happened to my son. 'He was only one foot away...My son just woke up, and the whole thing was on top of him. One feet closer, and my son was gone, you know.' She said checked his 'entire body' to see if 'everything was okay' after discovering the 'closet was collapsed on the bed.'   Velasquez's truck completely went through the home and ended up in the neighbor's backyard, destroying a large chunk of the shared fence.  'I was really confused,' Trinh said, who had originally thought the family home was being robbed, according to the New York Post. 'Everybody was panicking. We called the cops.'  'I got up, and I saw the guy who hit our house. He was like: 'Sorry'...and then he left.' Velasquez fled the scene on foot, but appeared on surveillance footage returning to the scene a few minutes later to get something from his truck before vanishing back to wooded area near the parkway.  'It could have been a lot worse, Trinh told CBS News. '[I'm] glad I didn't die last night.  His mother agree, telling CBS News: 'I feel a lot better now, I see my son and nothing's wrong with him.'  The family has now been displaced and is going to stay with relatives while their house, which has been ruled unlivable, gets repaired.  No injuries were reported.

Dick, 56, is considered to be one of the most recognizable comics of his time, but also a controversial one who has struggled with drug addiction and made headlines for his numerous arrests, sexual misconduct allegations, and bizarre behavior.    This week, the comedian made headlines again when he was arrested on Wednesday at an RV campground at O'Neill Regional Park in Orange County, Southern California. Dick was taken into custody on  suspicion of sexually assaulting a man in the RV where he was staying with livestreamers since being evicted from his apartment last year and is now held on $25,000 bail until his scheduled appearance on Friday.   The comedian's net worth also appears to have significantly dropped in recent years, plunging from an estimated $3 million in 2016 to $2.5 million in 2018 according to The Richest and to a mere $300,000 according to Celebrity Net Worth. A livestream of his recent arrest was shown on YouTube and footage posted to the channel 'Captain Content RV' afterwards revealed the events in the lead up. A young man, who goes by the name 'JJ', can be seen telling another person in the RV that he believed Dick had molested him in his sleep as he could feel some sort of lotion or lubricant in his butt. 'I was just in bed right now, and I smelled certain parts of my body ... [I was] in the other RV with Andy, and ... the last thing I remember, we were on the phone with his fiancee ... I smelled parts of myself and they smell like artificial smells,' he says while appearing slightly disorientated.  'JJ' is heard in the original livestream then trying to confront Dick about the alleged incident. Dick, who is heard saying that he's on the phone with his 'baby's mama' denies the allegation, and then is heard asking, 'Did you take my blow?' 'No, I didn't even take it whenever it was offered,' the man replies. 'JJ' man then asks Dick, 'Why did you assault me in my sleep?' Dick denies the accusations and tries to block the camera with his foot. 'I never assaulted you in your sleep,' he responds. 'Can you leave me alone?' Sgt. Scott Steinle confirmed to Page Six that the Special Victims Unit is involved in this situation and 'part of their investigation is to make sure that the victim is taken care of physically and that would also include a potential physical exam'.  The incident comes just a month after police were called to an apartment in Las Vegas where Dick had been staying with a Twitch streamer, who apparently pulled a gun on a third man during a chaotic scene caught on camera. Footage of the livestream shows Dick with a relatively unknown internet personality who goes by the name Wappy Flanker online, at whose apartment Dick had apparently been sleeping at. The shocking video, which was attempting to raise money to help the beleaguered comedian, then shows a third man join the pair at Flanker's place - where an argument quickly breaks out.  Flanker then pulls out a gun and warns the man to leave as Dick can be heard in the background saying 'Don't shoot the gun.'  TMZ reported that authorities were alerted to the situation after someone who was watching the live stream called for a welfare check. Commenters online began to speculate that Dick was being held hostage at the meager apartment - though Dick reportedly told police that he wanted to remain at the home. Dick's friend Elisa Jordana, 33, revealed on her YouTube show, Kermit and Friends last year that Dick had been staying at hostels and at one point stole 'cutlery, a wine glass, and plates' from a steakhouse. 'He asked for a doggie bag so he could put all that in,' she recalled, in addition to alleging he told the waitress he wanted to sleep with her. Dick, who got his first major break on the Ben Stiller Show in 1992 and is known for his roles in NewsRadio, Inspector Gadget and Road Trip, was dropped from two movies in 2017 - Raising Buchanan and Vampire Dad. The comedian was accused of groping members of the production but no one came forward to formally complain.  'I didn't grope anybody. I might have kissed somebody on the cheek to say goodbye and then licked them,' Dick told The Hollywood Reporter following his removal from the film. 'That's my thing--I licked Carrie Fisher at a roast. It's me being funny. I'm not trying to sexually harass people.' Dick was interviewed later that same year by TMZ who sought him out for comment regarding the string of sexual harassment scandals that rocked Hollywood in 2017. He appeared to make light of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein and actor Kevin Spacey, saying they were probably 'just trying to get a date'. Dick then threatened to grope the cameraman but at another point in the interview he tearfully admitted to contemplating suicide every day. In November 2021, Dick was arrested for felony domestic battery after he allegedly hit his boyfriend in the head with a liquor bottle. According to police, Dick and his boyfriend had been at his home when they got into a heated argument that quickly turned physical.  When police were called, they determined there was enough evidence to arrest the comedian, as his boyfriend was allegedly bleeding from a sizable wound on his head. Dick was released after he posted $50,000 bond. In October 2021, Dick was arrested for allegedly hitting his boyfriend in the face with a frying pan. In June 2021, the actor was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon for allegedly attacking a male partner with a metal chair. Dick also made his $50,000 bail after that altercation. In 2019, the actor was sentenced to 14 days in jail after being convicted of sexual battery for allegedly squeezing a woman's rear end but was released after a single night due to overcrowding. The same year, he was seen on video being slammed to the ground after he got into a fight with an Uber Eats driver while seemingly intoxicated. In 2019, Dick was reportedly knocked unconscious during an attack in New Orleans, and was taken to hospital to be observed for 'a possible brain bleed.' David Hale, 46, claimed Dick grabbed his genitals prior to the incident. The publication quotes a law enforcement source who states: 'Hale claims he had watched Dick perform at One Eyed Jacks and was saying goodbye to him when Dick grabbed Hale's genitals. 'Hale told investigators he became incensed, and Dick reacted by winking at him, ultimately leading Hale to punch Dick'. The comedian previously pleaded not guilty to one count of misdemeanor sexual battery in April 2018 after he allegedly groped an Uber driver's crotch.  Dick's estranged wife Lena Sved received a domestic violence restraining order against him in 2018, which required him to move out of their home and remain 100 yards away from her and their adult children: Lucas, 33, Jacob, 27, and Meg, 24. In 2012, he was arrested for allegedly grabbing a 17-year-old girl's top and pulling it down to expose her breasts. He was later found with marijuana and pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drug and battery charges, for which he was sentenced to three years of probation. In 2010, he was arrested for allegedly grabbing a man's genitals while intoxicated at a West Virginia bar. In 2007, Dick groped Ivanka Trump during an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live and was pulled off stage by security staff. She was greeted by Dick, who asked Ivanka for a 'big, wet kiss' right off the bat Kimmel later told Extra. The situation spiraled with Dick rubbing his hands on Ivanka's thighs and knee while she politely tried to stop the unwanted advances. Kimmel proceeded to stop Dick from touching Ivanka before continuing the interview. Dick continued to touch Ivanka, first trying to grab at Ivanka's ponytail and then touching her arm, before security dragged him off the stage.", "8a1850ac9c2819c5961b446e14bb64076f7633150108805d936bf952": "A cyclist has appeared in court for using bank cards found in a wallet that had been nabbed by a fox and then dropped in street.  The mischievous mammal helped itself to a wallet from under a car in Cowley, Oxfordshire, before ditching it. Less than five minutes later, Qasim Hussain, 36, who was cycling down the road, discovered the fox's loot and used the bank cards at the BP garage on Oxford Road to buy PS70 worth of cigarettes and alcohol.  The opportunist attempted to use the card four times and it was eventually declined. When the owner of the wallet noticed it had gone missing he decided to check his CCTV only to discover the foxy larcenist taking it from underneath his car at around 10pm. Footage then shows the cyclist making off with the goods.    Appearing before the magistrates' court, Hussain, of Hurst Street, Oxford, pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation. He also admitted stealing PS120-worth and PS240 worth of chocolate from two nearby Sainsbury's stores on separate occasions.  Prosecutor Anne Sawyer-Brandish told Oxford Magistrates' Court on Wednesday (11/5) that Hussain had 45 previous convictions. He was in court last May for shoplifting and given a community order the year before.    Nawaz Khan, mitigating, said Hussain's offense was purely opportunistic with the aid of the fox. She explained: 'Mr Hussain just happened to be passing by and rode over the wallet, stopped and found this credit card in there. 'Unfortunately he does then succumb to temptation.' The court heard Hussain had previously struggled with drug abuse but was now working with addiction charity Turning Point and receiving a methadone prescription. He gave a clean drug test result on the morning of his court appearance and was described by Mr Khan as 'a man who has changed in many ways'.   Imposing a 12 month conditional discharge, chairman of the bench Kay Whitaker said: 'We have noted that you have a substantial and lengthy history of offending. 'However, you have tried hard to reduce that and we are impressed you are attending Turning Point and impressed you have produced a negative test today. 'I don't underestimate the challenge of addressing a long-standing drug addiction.' He was ordered to pay PS250 compensation to Sainsbury's and a PS22 victim surcharge.", "549a7290565ad12295fe0a0fa9d778f9570b853892ed6c5354386018": "A former rising Bloomberg journalist who quit her job and divorced her husband to pursue a doomed relationship with infamous 'Pharma Bro' Martin Shkreli - before she was dumped through his lawyers - has said she has no regrets.  Christie Smythe, 39, said she is much happier since giving up the 'perfect little Brooklyn life' with her financier husband for Shkreli after she started covering him for work in early 2015 - when she broke the news of his arrest for securities fraud.  Although the romance came to an end when Shkreli broke up with her through his lawyers after she went public with the relationship in an Elle magazine feature, the former reporter says she bears no ill feelings.  'Part of me will always love Martin ... I absolutely don't have any regrets about what, you know, what has transpired,' Smythe told Fox Digital News.  'So we are friends, we talk. I am looking forward to seeing what he does when he gets out [of jail]. I am very excited to see him ... I imagine that there will be a very big hug,' she added about his September 2023 release. Shkreli is serving a seven-year sentence after being charged with running a pyramid scheme to prop up his pharma empire in 2015. He was already known as one of the most hated men in America for jacking up the price of a life-saving AIDS drug from $13.50 to $750.  Smythe has also launched her own endeavors after giving up her journalistic career to pursue the unlikely romance.  She plans to publish a memoir titled 'SMIRK: How I Fell in Love With the Most Hated Man in America' - in reference to Shkreli's infamous smirk at a congressional hearing that scrutinized his actions, which ultimately earned him the 'Pharma Bro' alias. 'You will be taken along on my journey from when I was a plucky Bloomberg legal reporter trying to ascend a career ladder, to my collision with an errant young striver whose many missteps and impulsive decisions caused him to fall directly in my path,' her website promises about the upcoming book.  'This is great, I am proud of you and thank you for thinking about my feelings as well. I hope it is a smash hit,' Shkreli allegedly wrote in an email about the book.  Speaking to Fox, Smythe said she didn't agree with the way an Elle profile characterized her relationship with Shkreli, adding that people had literally interpreted she had knowingly abandoned happiness to be with Shkreli.  'The framing was that I throw away my life for Martin Shkreli, and yeah, I kind of object to that characterization because my life has continued. I did not threw anything away. In fact, I am in a much happier place now than I used to be,' Smythe told the outlet.  'I had an Instagram perfect life ... and I just wasn't happy with my entire situation.  Smythe said that she felt drawn to Shkreli right after meeting him but did not trust her own instincts. Eventually, however, she said she realized the criminal mastermind was not what everyone said he was.   'I got to know him and  developed such a close relationship with him ... And what I liked about him is that he was extremely open honestly, very earnest, very smart,' she said.  'Smart in a way there is not just one thing he knows about, or just one thing he is good at. He is an intellectually curious person on a level I rarely see, so I was very intrigued by that.' Smythe left Bloomberg in 2018 and got divorced from her husband in 2019. She  had said she would wait for Shkreli while he served the remaining of his sentence. She also said she had frozen her eggs.  Smythe went public with the romance in 2020 -  much to the disapproval of Shkreli, who had warned her not to talk to the media about it. She said she was motivated to do the interview on Elle because she wanted to advocate for him in the event he became infected with COVID.  'I was very worried he would get sick and there wouldn't be anybody to advocate for him. So, I thought, you know what, I [have] to go public. People are going to pay attention to this and then at least I'll have a voice if he gets sick,' Smythe told Fox.  But Shkreli did not react well to the news and broke up with her through his lawyers.  'We are still friends, you know, nothing more. Because there is really no way of having a romantic relationship with someone in prison, where I can't even see him. It has been two years since I have seen him because visiting protocols are a nightmare, she added.  Shkreli, who once led Turing Pharmaceuticals, is currently serving seven years in prison for defrauding investors. He became infamous for suddenly raising the price of the drug Daraprim in 2015 by 5,000 percent - from $13.50 a pill to $750. He also drew attention in 2015 when he purchased for $2 million the sole edition of an album by rappers Wu-Tang Clan titled 'Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.' In 2018, he was sentenced to seven years in prison on an unrelated matter for lying to investors about the performance of two hedge funds he ran, withdrawing more money from those funds than he was entitled to get, and defrauding investors in a drug company, Retrophin, by hiding his ownership of some of its stock. Shkreli was ordered to forfeit $7.3 million as part of his unrelated prison sentence and is due to be released from prison in September 2023.  The pair first met in 2015 soon after she found out that he was under federal investigation for securities law violations.   Then, after his arrest, he contacted her when he'd been bailed out of jail.  For weeks afterward, she says he 'toyed' with her by promising an on-the-record interview only to give one to one of her competitors.  Eventually, he called asking for her advice because he needed a new lawyer. She said she was flattered.   They met again at a wine bar near his Murray Hill apartment where, she says, they bonded over their childhoods and the fact that neither of them went to Ivy League schools.  She then wrote a paper for a class she was taking at Columbia where she described being drawn in by him and how he manipulated reporters to his advantage. Her professor told her, she says, that the lines had become too muddied for her to be impartial in her reporting of her case.  'Maybe I was being charmed by a master manipulator,' she said.  Nonetheless, she decided she wanted to write a book about him. In 2017, she drafted a proposal. He then invited her to hear him speak at an event where he complimented her on stage, saying: 'Even if you find an honest reporter--I made friends with one, she's here right now.'  She recalls how afterwards, they were in a bar drinking with some of the audience members who had come to hear him speak, when he went to the bathroom.  She stepped in to entertain the crowd. 'It almost felt like I was a political wife,' she said.   Shkreli's trial began in 2017. By then, Smythe had taken book leave from Bloomberg.  She went to court every day to watch the trial and sometimes sat with his supporters, she claims, to gain an understanding of who they were for her book.  While he 'trolled' other reporters, including The New York Post's Emily Saul, Smythe fell deeper for him. 'He trolls because he's anxious and he really, really wants to be somebody,' she said.  Before he was convicted, the pair spent time together at his apartment. She claims it was 'for research'.  Even her husband warned her: 'He is just using you.'  He also said she was risking her professional reputation by 'getting too sucked into this bad person'.  She then went to visit him in jail and bought $30 of snacks from the vending machine because she didn't know what he would like.  She ended up heating up a hamburger for him in the microwave. In court, prosecutors read out some of their communications. She said it was only then that she realized she had become 'part of the story'.  She told her editors she could no longer cover the trial for Bloomberg but continued going to court and trying to sell the movie rights to her book, which publishers had passed on by this point.  She remembers dashing around the courtroom to greet people, claiming she felt like she was 'giving a dinner party.'  After he was sentenced to seven years, she kept visiting him in prison and acting as an 'advocate' for him online. She defended him on Twitter so much that her editors hauled her in for a meeting.  She quit, agreeing that she could no longer be impartial. She and her husband also decided that year to part ways. She does not attribute their divorce entirely to Shkreli but says: 'I'm not going to say it was wrong for him to be concerned.'  She continued visiting him but insists nothing physical had happened between them until then.    Then, in the visitors room, she told him she loved him. 'I told Martin I loved him. And he told me he loved me, too,' she said. She then asked if she could kiss him and he said yes.  They even discussed prenuptial agreements and she says she has frozen her eggs to be able to have kids with him when he gets out.  When he found out she was discussing their romance publicly, he stopped communicating with her.   His scheduled release date from a low-security federal prison is September 2023.

It is the latest evidence of Russia's brutal tactics as it pursues a stalled invasion that has failed in its key objectives. Last month, President Joe Biden labeled Russia's Ukraine war as a 'genocide.' Although other officials did not follow up with the sort of formal declaration that would trigger further intervention, the latest comments will increase pressure on Western nations to do more. U.S. Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Michael Carpenter described some of the evidence that could form the basis of criminal trials. 'As many eyewitness accounts have described in detail, Russia is subjecting many of these civilians to brutal interrogations in so-called 'filtration camps,' a process Russia planned before its further invasion of Ukraine on February 24,' he said in a speech to the OSCE permanent Council in Vienna. 'During this so-called 'filtration' process, Russia's forces reportedly process and interrogate detained Ukrainian citizens to identify anyone with ties to the Ukrainian government or military, as well as individuals with 'pro-Ukraine' convictions.' He described how detainees' cell phones have been taken away, passwords coerced from their owners, and social media and messages scanned for evidence of opposition to Russia's war against Ukraine. In some cases, passports have been reportedly confiscated, he continued. 'The United States assesses that Russia's forces have relocated at least several thousand Ukrainians for processing in these 'filtration camps,' and evacuated at least tens of thousands more to Russia or Russia-controlled territory, sometimes without telling evacuees of their final destination,' he said. 'From Mariupol alone, we assess that Russia's forces have forcibly displaced thousands of civilians into Russian territory. 'Numerous eyewitness accounts indicate that 'filtering out' entails beating and torturing individuals to determine whether they owe even the slightest allegiance to the Ukrainian state.' Survivors described how they feared being taken to the Ukrainian province of Donetsk, run by Russian sympathizers, where they faced a 'dark fate.' 'According to one survivor, 'If a person was suspected of being a 'Ukrainian Nazi', they took them to Donetsk for further investigation or murder.... Everybody was afraid to be taken to Donetsk,' the ambassador continued.  'Another survivor recounted a conversation she overheard between two Russian soldiers as she and her family were undergoing 'filtration' outside of Mariupol. ''What did you do with people who didn't pass the filtration?' one soldier asked. The response: 'Shot 10 and stopped counting.''  Carpenter said that such displacements breached international humanitarian law.  'Mr. Chair, we must not allow this evil to stand,' he said.  'The United States will continue to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's war of aggression, end the unconscionable war crimes committed by members of Russia's forces, and hold those responsible to account.' Carpenter delivered his powerful account on the day Ukraine prepared for its first war crimes trial since Russia's invasion began, for a 21-year-old service member accused of gunning down an unarmed 62-year-old from a car window. Vadim Shishimarin faces life in prison for allegedly killing the civilian with a Kalashnikov rifle as he fled with four other soldiers in a stolen car in a village in Sumy on February 28, just days after the start of the war. In Geneva, the U.N. Human Rights Council passed a resolution to set up an investigation into possible war crimes by Russian troops in the Kyiv area and beyond before they were driven out at the end of March, a move that Russia said amounted to political score-settling.  U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said there were many examples of possible war crimes, including unlawful killings and summary executions. The man was pushing a bicycle by the side of the road when he was shot in the head and 'died on the spot a few dozen metres from his home', the Ukrainian prosecutor general said. Meanwhile, Russia suffered another huge setback on the battlefield.  Ukrainian forces drove Russian troops from the region around the country's second biggest city of Kharkiv in their fastest advance since pushing Moscow to withdraw from around the capital Kyiv. And they thwarted a Russian attempt to cross a river in Donbas, destroying dozens of vehicles and inflicting heavy casualties. Satellite images lay bare the scale of the failure with the remains of two pontoon bridges drifting in the Donets River at Bilohorivka, west of the city of Lysychansk, surrounded by the ruins of tanks and armoured vehicles.", "82e00975fc49462b75950322021ad50e65141eae007156aed6ca268a": "Former President Trump went after Pennsylvania Senate candidate Kathy Barnette after she surged in the polls to the No. 2 spot behind the candidate he endorsed, Dr. Mehmet Oz, but left the door open to supporting her in the future.  'Kathy Barnette will never be able to win the General Election against the Radical Left Democrats,' Trump said in a Thursday afternoon statement.  'She has many things in her past which have not been properly explained or vetted, but if she is able to do so, she will have a wonderful future in the Republican Party--and I will be behind her all the way.'  The far-right Barnette would typically be a dream candidate for Donald Trump - she fought hard against the 2020 election results (in which she also lost to Rep. Madeline Dean in a heavily blue Philadelphia district). The conservative commentator says she organized a bus to Washington, D.C. for the 'Save America' rally which preceded the Capitol riot on Jan. 6.  But as news outlets have begun to poke around her past, Barnette has steeled herself against any inquiries for proof that she is who she says she is.   In the waning days before Tuesday's primary election, Barnette has curiously shot up in popularity, bypassing hedge fund executive David McCormick and threatening the frontrunner status of Oz by some polls.  She made national headlines when she went after Oz on abortion during a debate earlier this month, revealing that she was the product of rape when her mother was just 11 years old and her father 21.  Arguing for a ban a total ban on abortions, Barnette said that the story of how she came to be showed her the 'sanctity of life ... regardless of conception.'  Seemingly caught off guard by the 50-year-old black Philadelphia woman's rise in popularity, Trump did not attack Barnette in his rally for Oz last week, though he characterized McCormick as soft on China and a 'RINO.'  Barnette's spending is mere pocket change compared to that of Oz and McCormick - the pair have spent $12.4 million and $11.4 million on television commercials respectively, mostly attacking each other, Barnette has spent $137,000 on TV, according to Politico. Trump's attacks come one day after Fox News host Sean Hannity said that remarks she'd made in the past were troubling.  'But the problem is,' he explained, 'we're now looking at what is a must-hold Republican Senate seat if the Republicans ever want to take the majority in the U.S. Senate.'  Barnette's checkered past includes many tweets where she called Obama a 'Muslim,' and another tweet where she announced 'Just confronted a Muslim today.'  In other tweets flagged by Jacob Rubashkin of Inside Elections, Barnette in 2017 called for the U.S. to ban Islam, and said that pedophilia was a 'cornerstone' of the religion.  While her opponents have gone to war with each other, Barnette has used her compelling personal story to connect with voters on the ground - she often tells of how she grew up on a pig farm in Alabama, before becoming a veteran, then working at two financial firms and as an adjunct professor of corporate finance, and authoring the book, 'Nothing to Lose, Everything to Gain: Being Black and Conservative in America.' But the details of that personal story remain a mystery.   When asked by the Washington Examiner about her past, such as the name of the college where she taught classes and what financial firms she worked at, her campaign said Barnette 'keeps her early life as private as possible.' Sean Parnell, who previously won Trump's endorsement for the GOP Senate race but dropped out due to domestic abuse allegations by his ex-wife, questioned why Barnette had not provided any public record of her DD214, a standard document service members are issued once they leave the military, despite requests to do so from multiple news outlets.    'I see a ton of blue checks & others fawning over [Barnette] but the fact is, other than what she's told you, you don't really know much. How long did she serve? Have you seen her DD214? What was her discharge status? Where did she graduate from college?' Parnell wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.  Barnette has posted a photo of herself in uniform and claimed she spent 10 years in the military, but has at times used the wrong terminology. She has said at some points said that she spent 10 years in the U.S. Army Reserves, but her website claims she was in the 'Armed Forces Reserves,' a branch of service that does not appear to exist.  On his podcast this week, Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, called Barnette 'pure MAGA-- in fact, Kathy Barnette may be ultra-MAGA.'  'Stunning polling coming out last night. ... Oz and McCormick combined, I think, have spent $24 million, combined. $24 million! ... And she's basically in a dead heat,' Bannon said on his 'War Room' podcast Monday.   No matter to Barnette that she has not won the former president's support.  'He is not Jesus, so he gets to be wrong,' Barnette said of Trump in an April debate. 'And on this endorsement, he's wrong. We're not a cult. It was never us aligning with President Trump and his values. It was Trump aligning with our values. He was talking about what we were thinking.'", "b7e89484d7a822407baab93adf93512ca16c23805dc999095b055558": "The Liberal Party have released new commercial showing an animated Anthony Albanese arguing with himself, parodying the flawed character Gollum from the Lord of the Rings.  The Liberal Party attack ad claims the Labor leader isn't being sincere about his policy positions.  An animated Mr Albanese argues with himself over coal, taxes and pay rises in the feature titled: 'The Lord of the Flip-Flops: The Return of the Taxes'. 'Morrison is keeping his precious ($1 an hour pay rise) away from Australian workers. He's being tricksy,' the animated Labor leader says. The ad starts with Mr Albanese saying 'we will tax all of them, so much money', before he argues with his soft-hearted alter-ego - referencing Gollum's previous identity Smeagol. 'I want their money,' Gollum Mr Albanese says. 'No, you can't tell them. It's the only way we get precious votes,' Smeagol Mr Albanese replies. The Labor leader continues to argue with himself about his 'fully costed policies', before he then puts on a miner's helmet. 'Coal is so good. It gets us precious in the Queensland,' Mr Albanese says. 'Use your head, there are precious votes in Melbourne,' his alter-ego replies, wearing a hipster hat and holding a coffee to represent an inner-city Melburnian. 'We just tell them both what they want to hear.' They then mock Labor's flip-flopping on JobKeeper, with the Gollum Mr Albanese saying 'we changed so many times'. 'Whatever we says to win votes.' Mr Albanese then accuses himself of standing for nothing and being 'too weak', before breaking down in tears. The commercial ends with Gollum reading: 'It won't be easy under Albanese'. Comments were predictably one-sided, with people shocked the Liberal Party saw fit to release the parody. 'Now I understand why Scomo was sacked from Tourism Australia...' one man said, referring to Mr Morrison's departure from the board in 2006. '2003 called it wants its memes back,' another person commented. One man summed it up succinctly, saying: 'This is a really weird ad.'  The ad comes after Mr Albanese stormed to victory following the final leaders' debate on Wednesday night.  The debate came after a new poll published in The Australian newspaper predicted Labor will win a small majority with 80 seats.", "5edc7ef2be22b05bc6947dd1ef9d42995fba5527bd0563edec5b7e1e": "An Oregon mom in the midst of a bitter custody battle carried out a murder-suicide of her and her two children, police say.  On Tuesday police found 31-year-old Ashley Palmer, her six-year-old daughter Kayleana Beatrice Palmer and eight-year-old son Xavier Rayvaughn Danger Palmer dead from apparent gunshot wounds in their Gresham apartment after following up on a welfare check.  Police determined that Palmer carried out the gruesome killings before turning the gun on herself as she struggled to deal with the prospect of having to split custody of the children with her ex-wife.  In 2018 Palmer separated from her 34-year-old partner Jenavie Palmer before divorcing two years later. Following their split the two became embroiled in a 'pretty bad' custody dispute. 'We were in the middle of trial and the children were going back and forth between our houses,' Jenavie told Oregonlive.com  According to Jenavie, hours before the children were found dead she received a disturbing text from Ashley which included a YouTube link to a music playlist that said 'mother children murder suicide 2022' Jenavie said she called the police but they were not able to get inside the apartment and they told her to wait until morning to check on the children, but it would be too late.  The murder-suicide came after years of bickering over custody.   Palmer claimed in court twice that her children would face 'imminent harm' if Janavie was allowed partial custody, which Jenavie's lawyer Erin O'Riley claimed was her go-to move whenever she did not get her way.  The order was initially granted in July 2021 but that was dismissed shortly after when it was determined the kids were not in danger.  A second request was dismissed the day it was filed in February, Oregonlive.com reported.  Things continued to be contentious when in April Jenavie sought equal custody, citing a domestic violence charge that had been pleaded down to disturbing the peace.  Now the heartbroken mom, who last saw her children the weekend before Mothers Day earlier this month, only has memory of her children. She recalled how much Xavier enjoyed video games and Legos, saying 'He was smart and full of love. He was so caring.' She said her daughter Kayleana loved painting.  'She used to make up songs about calling the unicorns to come so she could play with them,' she told Oregonlive.com Janavie, who was meant to be reunited with her kids the day they were killed, said in her last conversation together they were happy and excited to see her again.  'They were loved,' Jenavie said. 'They had their whole lives ahead of them and it was stolen from them. They are going to be very, very missed.'", "8cac64ba1a4cd4f4edf2b136cd91637398ae9c7fd52ff6e0f11528ac": "The House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol has subpoenaed five Republican lawmakers to learn about their conversations with Donald Trump and other information they have about the day. The summons includes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of Calfornia along with GOP Reps. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Mo Brooks of Alabama.  The lawmakers either participated in meetings at the White House, had direct conversations with President Trump leading up to and during the attack, or were involved in the planning and coordination of certain activities on and before January 6th, the committee said in a statement. 'The committee just found that before we close the loop on our investigation, the members should come in should they choose and offer a response to the information we found,' Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, chairman of the panel, told reporters on Capitol Hill.  If any of the lawmakers refuse, the Democratic-controlled House could vote to hold them in contempt of Congress. From there, the Justice Department would decide whether or not to formally pursue charges.  'I have not seen this subpoena. I guess they sent it to you guys before they send it to me,' McCarthy told reporters on Capitol Hill. 'Look, my view on the committee has not changed. They're not conducting legitimate investigation. That seems as though they just want to go after their political opponents.' He didn't answer questions on whether he would comply with it.  Rep. Biggs said it was a 'witch hunt.' 'The January 6 Committee's ongoing, baseless witch hunt is nothing more than an effort to distract the American people from the Democrats' and Biden's disastrous leadership,' he tweeted.  All five had been asked previously - and refused - to voluntarily testify before the panel.  'We're forced to take this step,' the Jan. 6 panel said of the subpoenaes. The move is a dramatic escalation in the committee's investigation and follow weeks of internal debate on whether to try to force Republicans to testify behind closed doors. Congressional subpoenas for sitting members of Congress, especially for a party leader, are almost without precedent.  They come as the panel is preparing for a series of public hearings this June.  Rep. Perry said the subpoenaes were sent for 'headlines. 'This is all for headlines and sensationalization,' he said. 'The fact that they send it to the press before they send it to the members just proof it's all about headlines.' McCarthy has admitted to speaking with Trump on the day MAGA supporters stormed the Capitol to try and stop the certification of the 2020 election. But he's offered few details of that conversation. Jordan also spoke with Trump. He is a close ally of the former president and was deeply involved in efforts to contest the 2020 election results.  Perry has continuously disputed the validity of Biden's victory in Pennsylvania. The panel previously said it wants to discuss Perry's attempted effort to install former Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general when the DOJ resisted Trump's false claims of voter fraud.  It also said it believed Perry was communicating with Mark Meadows, who was then the White House chief of staff, via an encrypted app, Signal.  In Biggs' case, the committee wants to know about his participation 'in certain planning meetings' with the White House before Jan. 6th. They also want to know about his conversations about having former Vice President Mike Pence 'unilaterally refuse' to accept votes certified states.  The committee's interest in Biggs is on the heels of an April 22 court filing in which lawmakers accused him of being an active participant in White House meetings after the 2020 election, where he and other Republicans brainstormed ways to keep Trump in power. Biggs is also accused of encouraging protesters to come to Washington on Jan. 6 as well as persuading state legislators and officials that the election was stolen.  The panel wants to ask Brooks about his recent comments following a spat with Trump after the former president pulled back his endorsement. Brooks said Trump 'asked me to rescind the election of 2020' weeks before leaving office. Brooks spoke at the Jan. 6th rally on the Ellipse, where he famously said: 'Today is the day American patriots start down names and kicking ass.' He also came up on a leaked House leadership call where leaders fretted about lawmakers calling out fellow members of the conference.  The committe also has expressed an interest in talking to Republican Rep. Ronnie Jackson of Texas but he was not among those subpoenaed. Jackson served as Trump's personal physician and has been an ardent defender of the former president.

The Sale player has been banned from footy for six weeks after he violently hit an apprentice plumber during a match against Brouin in the Gippsland League under-18s on Saturday. Shocking footage of the incident was captured, which occurred after a brawl erupted on the full time siren. 'You can see that I'm not facing him ... it's a stupid act, especially when the bloke isn't facing you,' the victim told the Herald Sun. 'It's sickening, considering the kid's not even 17. I remember blacking out for a bit then... not being able to move my body, barely being able to speak.' The melee ensued after a Sale player was smashed by a Drouin boy in front of the stands. Both teams run in and start pushing and shoving, before the 18-year-old Droiun player and 16-year-old split off. The younger Sale player then strikes his opposition, before hitting him again. Droun's coach Harry Wans said it was 'the worst thing I've ever seen on a football field'.  'I was so close to jumping out and getting involved. It took the ambulance 45 minutes to get him off the field,' he told the Herald Sun. The Drouin player claims the 16-year-old was bragging to his teammates about knocking him out. The victim was taken to hospital with a mild concussion and badly bruised eye. Police arrested the boy at the footy field but he's been released while they continue their investigations.  The club director of Sale Football Club said the incident was a 'poor reflection' but the 16-year-old was a 'terrific young kind'. 'We just don't want to see it happen to anyone on a football field regardless of what the precursors are,' Sam Anstee said.", "8e4133d0c74fc15fd98feea550421126c5c6b151c2685c7cd1dcac9c": "A former director of data science at Thomson Reuters said he was fired for sharing research on the company's internal social media platform that showed police killed more unarmed white people than black people and that the Black Lives Matter movement allegedly caused the deaths of thousands.  Zac Kriegman, who worked at Thomson Reuters for six years before being fired last summer, claimed he was let go from his $350,000 job because he stood against the company's reporting conventions on BLM in order to dispel what the 'false narrative' that black people were the largest victim of police violence.  In a piece first published on Bari Weiss's Substack, Common Sense, Kriegman said he shared with collogues concerns that reports saying unarmed black people are killed by police at a disproportionately higher rate than their white counterparts was not accurate. The Washington Post, which has led the effort to document fatal police shootings, found that police had killed 3,024 white people and 1,596 black people since 2015. The findings highlight that black people were disproportionately affected by the shootings as they make up only 13 percent of the U.S. population, but Kriegman said the rhetoric was incomplete and when he tried proving it, he said he received backlash from fellow white co-workers.  'I was publicly derided as a 'troll,' 'confused,' 'laughable,' and 'not worth engaging with or even attempting to have an intelligent conversation' with,' Kriegman wrote.  Thomson Reuters said it does not discuss specific employee issues and that 'Reuters, the news division of Thomson Reuters, reports on topics related to race and equality and the BLM organization in a fair, unbiased and independent manner, consistent with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles'.  Kriegman had argued that rather at looking at the population as a whole to see who was truly more impacted by police violence, reporters needed to instead take into account what racial groups police felt more threatened from.  To this end, Kriegman cited the FBI's research into the racial demographics of those who had killed or assault police officers.  The FBI's data, which records violence against officers from 2010 to 2019, found that there were 199 instances of black people attacking officers but 537 cases of where white people were the offenders.  He said these instances better aligned with the Washington Posts findings, concluding that unarmed black people are not disproportionately affected by the police killings.  Kriegman added that the rhetoric that they were only fueled anti-police sentiments, which he claimed has led to the uptick in crime nationwide, specifically in predominantly black neighborhoods.  He cited the Ferguson Effect, a controversial theory that claimed crime rose nationwide following backlash against police over the shooting of Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014.  Although the theory has been disputed, with crime upticks only recorded in large cities, Kriegman said Black Lives Matter's claims have led to the same results now. 'I have avidly followed the research on the movement and its impacts, which has led me, inexorably, to the conclusion that the claim at the heart of the movement, that police more readily shoot black people, is false and likely responsible for thousands of black people being murdered in the most disadvantaged communities in the country.' Kriegman said he wanted his research to open up conversations into how they could better report the issue and 'accurately' depict the reality of police shootings.  Instead, he saw his post get taken down because it was allegedly 'antagonistic' and 'provocative'. He claimed one colleague at Thomson Reuters had told him: 'I do not believe that there is any point in trying to engage in a blow-by-blow refutation of your argument, and I will not do so. 'My unwillingness to do so doesn't signal the strength of your argument. If someone says, 'The KKK did lots of good things for the community--prove me wrong,' I'm not obligated to do so.' Kriegman claimed his bosses at Thomson Reuters stayed quiet while he endured the criticism, and when he emailed HR about the alleged attacks, he was told he would be fired if he discussed his experience on the company's internal channels.  The data scientist said he doubted the company would fire him and proceeded to email his colleague and company leadership about the situation, and he was terminated three days later.  Kriegman filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination in July for being allegedly 'fired in retaliation for complaining about a racially hostile work environment'.  The case is the latest instance of a professional in journalism claiming they received backlash for failing to conform to a woke mob.  Former New York Times columnist Bari Weiss quit her job at the paper in 2020 with a resignation letter that went viral where she railed against the liberal newspaper's alleged bias and said it no longer served journalism. Weiss claimed that the papers private Slack channel was filled with bullying and harassment against those who failed to conform to woke ideology and said the editors 'live in total fear of internet mobs.'  'Normal people who watch others being attacked, they have a perfectly human response - they stay quiet,' Weiss said on her Honestly podcast last fall. 'The threat of public shaming has been massively, enormously, amazingly effective. It has led to an epidemic of self-silencing and fear.' Weiss' wife, Nellie Bowles, a former tech reporter at the Times, said she too was bullied out last November by colleagues who allegedly leaked stories to embarrass her.  She claimed she began at the paper as a 'very happy, lauded bulldog liberal of a writer' but that the outlet and the culture in general shifted toward a 'charismatic new ideology' that she felt pressured to 'cheer on or otherwise carefully ignore.'  'When I didn't, I became suspect,' she wrote. 'My colleagues started leaking stories to other publications to embarrass me.' Bowles added that she was particularly bothered by being contacted by a magazine reporter who was asked her about her co-workers being angry at her for going to CHAZ [Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone] in Seattle during the racial justice protests in 2020.  'Efforts by well-meaning bosses to intervene only made it more frenzied,' she continued. 'At first it was crazy-making, like a breakup or a betrayal, a feeling so many in my position have written about beautifully already in this newsletter.' CHAZ was a protest movement that closed off six blocks of Seattle for over three weeks by protesters after the Seattle Police Department left its building within the zone. Four shootings took place in the police-free zone during the protest. Bowles visited and published a story about the movement in August.   Bowles said that those who have made similar decisions made it easier and 'more fun' to quit and get 'outside' the 'old newspapers and mainstream TV networks' which she slammed as 'docile and predictable.'  Conservative talk show host Amber Athey also slammed woke culture after she was fired from her Washington D.C. radio station for making fun of Vice President Kamala Harris' clothes in March.  Amber Athey, who worked on a morning show at news station WMAL, wrote a joking tweet about the color of the suit Harris was wearing.  'Kamala looks like a UPS employee -- what can brown do for you? Nothing good, apparently,' Athey wrote in the March 1 tweet, referring to an old UPS tagline. She wrote on The Spectator, a conservative magazine she works for, that there was no sign of any offense being caused by the pithy comment until a few days later. 'All of a sudden, the Kamala tweet was being re-framed as racist and dozens of Twitter accounts were bragging about contacting my employers about my 'bigotry,'' Athey wrote.  These clashes against woke culture were not secluded to only America, as Canadian Broadcasting Corporation journalist Tara Henley made the stunning claim that she quit the company in January due to 'woke' policies implemented by senior staffers that hindered her ability to do her job. Writing on her own Substack, slammed CBC brass for what she called 'a radical political agenda that originated on Ivy League campuses in the United States.' She claimed the news outlet has yielded to 'far-left ideology' that has left employees obsessing over race and which demographic should receive more coverage.

Erin Lee said Wellington Middle School in Colorado was open about 'intentionally' not telling parents about her child being lectured on gender and identity. She said the institution told her they could not let them in on the guest speaker event because they had 'to offer a safe space for students'. Her daughter had been invited by her art teacher Jenna Riep for an after school arts class that actually turned out to be a Genders & Sexualities Alliance event. She told how her daughter came home and revealed a speaker told them they may be transgender if they were not comfortable in their bodies. The horrified mother claimed they also asked kids who they were sexually attracted to and informed they could be queer while being shown a 'Genderbread person'. The bizarre diagram has been used in some woke schools and workplaces to claim anatomical sex is 'male-ness' or 'female-ness' - but has been criticized by some academics. Lee also alleged the youngsters were even asked to keep details of the meeting a secret and warned their parents were not safe. The lesson, which district officials have since defended, spurred the concerned mother to pull the child out of the public school, and enroll her into an $8,000-a-year private school. Meanwhile authorities were said to be seeking an LGBT coordinator to oversee all grades on a salary of up to $95,000-a-year. Lee told DailyMail.com school bosses 'seemed empathetic to our situation but confirmed that the meeting intentionally happened in secret, with parental knowledge, because the school has to offer a safe space for students'. She told how that the incident began after her daughter sent her a text message asking to go to an after-school art club, saying art teacher Riep had invited her. The 'Genderbread Person' is a recently surfaced education tool used by schools and companies to teach students and workers that anatomy doesn't always determine gender. The bizarre diagram has been used in some woke schools and workplaces to claim anatomical sex is 'male-ness' or 'female-ness' - but has been criticized by some academics.    The model breaks down the concepts of gender into three aspects: sex, gender identity, gender expression.  Sexual orientation is also measured in the strange graphic, due to its supposed connection to gender identity and expression. The diagram is used to determine what sex a student or worker is sexually attracted to - with many schools using it to inform children that they could be gay.  Critics have branded the learning material - which was distributed by the Biden administration to his state's department of education earlier this year - as 'unscientific nonsense.' Last month, GOP Pennsylvania state Rep. Aaron Bernstine sent a letter last week to his state's Secretary of Education questioning the material, which he said had been 'distributed' by the US DOE to the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE), 'and is an option to be used in curriculum for students in the 6-7 age range.' 'There is no reason to be having these conversations with such young children, and it is unacceptable,' Bernstine stated in a press release. 'The classroom is not the place to push this ideology onto them.' Whether the diagram is included in a US public school's curriculum content, is determined by each individual school district or charter school. She and her husband, Jonathan, then gave their permission for the child to attend - however, upon picking up the schoolgirl from the supposed art club, the pair quickly realized something was wrong. She continued: 'We were completely caught off guard and ill-equipped to help our daughter make sense of what had happened to her. 'We feel so fortunate that she broke the rule and told us what happened. 'We fear how far her teacher, this external influencer and her peers also influenced by these adults would push her down the path of adopting the transgender label. 'Our first action was to immediately contact the woman who had given her personal information to our child. 'Her response was delusional and seemed to double-down on everything she had done and her need to target younger and younger children.' 'She then told the kids that parents aren't safe, and that it's OK to lie to them about where they are in order to attend this meeting,' the mom, who has since enrolled her daughter in a private Christian school but still has a son at the public school, told Fox News. Lee said the speaker - who delivered the lesson to the group on May 4 of last year - then gave the students her personal contact information and encouraged them to contact her on social media platforms such as Discord and What'sApp. 'She doubled down that parents aren't safe [and] that heterosexuality and monogamy are not normal,' Lee further revealed. After confronting school staffers and guest speaker Chambers about the lesson, The Poudre School District confirmed the existence of the club, and asserted that conversations in its GSA groups 'may be confidential' given the' sensitive' nature of the meetings' discussions. 'In PSD, we promise to create and uphold equitable, inclusive, and rigorous educational opportunities, outcomes, and experiences for all students,' the district said in a statement to DailyMail.com.  'As a district, we are committed to making our schools safe spaces in which all students can learn. 'Genders and Sexualities Alliances, or GSAs, were established as safe spaces for members of the LGBTQIA+ community, allies, and any individual to come together with the goals of ensuring inclusivity, safety, and support.  'Discussions in GSAs may be confidential given that they can sometimes be sensitive in nature (i.e. a student may be 'out' with specific friends but not with the community at large),' it went on, adding that the GSA was 'school-sponsored' and approved by the district.   The district declined to comment on the allegations made by Lee 'to protect the privacy of the student and their family.' District brass further asserted that they had addressed the issue with Lee 'on multiple occasions over the past year,' and that her daughter is no longer enrolled in the district. Lee said the school also confirmed the meeting is always held in secret.  Email correspondence obtained by Parents Defending Education between Chambers and art teacher Riep show the LGBTQ advocate expressing concerns over the mother's complaints concerning the club.       The messages, sent on May 6 and May 7 following Lee's complaints to the school and district, show Chambers asking school staff to remind the mom that 'the room is a safe space and that she should not share the names of her friends in attendance.' She also told a seemingly worried Riep that emails and phone conversations she had had with Lee should be recorded and thought of as 'evidence.' 'Hello! This is private and I will be responding with a bcc for all of you, but it's important for you to know the response messaging that I send out,' Chamber wrote in one email sent to Riep and Katie Delahunt, a guidance counselor at Wellington Middle.     'You can forward my response to admin at [Wellington Middle School], they probably will receive similar messages from this parent.  'Tread lightly because this parent has HUGE potential to coming in to understanding or rejecting their child.  'I'll respond with what we know to work so far- but it's always a gamble and a kids' access comes in to view,' Chambers went on. 'If you know which parent this is, can you politely remind their student that the room is a safe space and that she should not share the names of her friends in attendance?' She then wrote, 'I'll reply to the email with you all bcc'd in the next hour or so. Any conversation with this parent should have the impression in our minds as 'evidence', verbiage is everything. Thanks!' The next morning, Riep responded: 'Hey Kimberly, Sorry I am just responding, this has been a lot to process. The family has reached out the school a couple times this week, we are trying to get to a good place with them.  'I really appreciate you taking the time to write thoughtful response. Thank you so much for your support and time, I'd love to get some advice sometime this summer on how I can best support students if something like this happens again.  Chambers responded shortly thereafter, assuring the art teacher not to worry over Lee's complaints to the school and district, citing that they had 'strong ally' in Kristen Draper, a board member for the Poudre School District who also volunteers with SPLASH.   Chambers also cited the Equal Access Act - a guidance that says federally funded schools cannot deny students the right to conduct meetings over religious, political, or philosophical content - as a reason that 'parents don't have to approve which clubs and activities their children participate in.' 'As needed,' Chambers wrote, 'You have a strong ally in our Board of Education, who can help your admin with responses and base them on the Equal Access Act where parents don't have to approve which clubs and activities their children participate in (which will probably be the next attempt by this parent).  'Kristen Draper has been briefed on this parents' outreach and she is ready to respond if anyone needs it.  'She is very available to you via email, even if you Admin just want advice, and has fielded all of the other middle schools as they began GSA's and pushed through these barriers.' The woke activist went on to assert that their handling of the situation would serve as a precedent for future conflicts of similar nature. 'If there is additional work that I can do on my side, please let me know, how this is handled will set a precedence for other parents as they hear about it, so a strong first allyship is key.' Chambers then asked: 'Have you been able to check in with to make sure she is okay?' In the next email, Riep revealed that the child had left the school, spurring Chambers to advise the staffer to perform a wellness check on the unidentified student. She cited one 'former extreme case,' where she said 'a parent had been so concerned' about what was being taught to their child in a GSA group,' that the child 'wasn't allowed to leave home without family until they decided his 'gender identity' was 'nonsense.' Chamber said the 13-year-old student was then removed from Liberty Commons Charter, also part of the Poudre School District, and sent to a boarding school. According to Chambers, the student attempted suicide twice after being pulled from the school. Chambers went on to assure Riep that they were not in the wrong, and touted their efforts as heroic. 'It's a lot of work being an ally in these situations, but it's rewarding in the end. I have requested to join the Wellington community group right after our session but haven't been admitted as of yet. Thanks again.' DailyMail.com reached out to Chambers Thursday for comment regarding the GSA group and Lee's claims, but did not immediately hear back. Lee, meanwhile, says it's time for families to withdraw their young students from woke public schools such as those in the Colorado school district, to properly protect their children.  She said she called the police to report the incident, who said they were unable to help due to the fact that the lesson occurred in a classroom and there was no accusation of physical touch or exposure of body parts.  Lee told New American Magazine that her daughter is now attending a private, Christian school and is 'doing much better.' Elementary school staffers bragged about outright ignoring parents' requests to refer to their kids by their given names and pronouns last month, during a virtual panel that saw speakers refer to parents as 'caregivers.' The virtual 'Creating and Sustaining GSAs in Elementary Schools' meeting, held over Zoom April 26, saw moderator Katy Butler, a second grade public school teacher at Harvey Milk Civil Rights Academy in San Francisco, poise a question to her fellow panelists concerning pronoun use when it comes to their students. The inquiry, sent to the group by another, unnamed educator, asked advice on how to deal with parents peeved over teachers' pronoun use.  'What should we do if a parent requests that we refer to their child by the pronouns associated with their sex assigned at birth instead of their preferred pronouns, and that we use a legal name instead of a student's chosen name?' Butler - who panel organizers billed as a white queer cisgender female teacher on social media - read.  Butler - the creator of Gender Inclusive Classrooms, the group that organized the panel - then gave way for the three other panelists, staffers at public schools across the country, to weigh in on the matter. One panelist, fellow cocreator Kieran Slattery, a fifth grade teacher in Massachusetts, proceeded to provide his advice on the matter - proudly revealing instances where he ignored parents' requests to call their child by certain pronouns. 'So, I can respond with something that I've done,' Slattery, who teaches at Jackson Street Elementary, began. 'This came up for me - it's come up in a couple different ways - but it's come up for me where caregivers asked.' Slattery said: 'I actually refer to their child's name... using the name the name they asked to be referred to and their chosen pronouns, and caregivers reacted very strongly.' The teacher then detailed how parents 'followed up with me and the principal, and said, like, 'I know you were using a different name than my child's given name at birth and the pronouns we gave them, and I'm respectfully asking that you use the name and the pronouns that we gave them.' Slattery - who panel organizers billed as a 'white, queer transgender man' - proceeded to warn the three other panelists of the legal concerns that come with rejecting parents' requests on how they refer to their children.  'So the laws in every state are different, obviously, and I can't speak to the laws in everyone's particular state, but I will say - again, the resources that we'll give you after this have some helpful sites where you can look up what the rules are for your state,' the Northampton elementary school teacher said.   'Before I responded to the caregiver, I made sure I ran it by my principal and my superintendent just to make sure that they had my back.' The transgender teacher then revealed how he rejected the request of one pair of parents - or as he called them, 'caregivers' - touting the slight as a victory.    'And then I responded - and I chose my words carefully - and I said, 'I hear you, I hear what you're saying,' Slattery said, adding that, 'I tried to really affirm what the caregiver was asking me, like in terms of, 'I hear you saying that you're feeling uncomfortable with me using the child's preferred name and pronouns; I hear that you're using different ones at home.' He continued: 'But here at school, the expectation is that all of my students feel comfortable and welcome in my classroom.' The assertion saw the educator put particular emphasis on the word 'my.' 'So, in my classroom, I will refer to your child by whatever name and pronouns that they've told me they feel most comfortable with,' Slattery then said, with his fellow panelists nodding in approval.  The teacher went on to equate conveying that concept to parents to teaching children in his classroom.  'Just have that be it,' he said - 'almost like the guidelines I try to use when I'm, like, explaining hard topics to my students. Like, less is more.' The other panelists again nodded in approval. Slattery continued: 'I just say, like, 'That sounds like it works really well for you at home, and you can absolutely choose to do whatever you like at home. 'In my classroom - and I even say, like, every year I start out my year by sending home information to caregivers that says, like, 'Just so you know, this is an affirming class - the way that I affirm students is I call them by the names they ask to be called by and use their correct pronouns.' The teacher then reiterated how he denied the parents' request.  'I just told them - maybe that's not helpful - I just told them, 'No,'' seemingly conceding the contentious nature of his assertion. 'Respectfully, no.'  The assertion again garnered more impassioned nods from the other panelists.   'And because I had my principal and my superintendent's support, there wasn't much they can do,' Slattery then said. 'And they eventually, kind of like, found another topic to squawk about,' he added, before letting out a laugh. 'And they left that alone.' The remaining panelists all seemed to agree with the educator's assertion, with Butler in particular nodding affirmatively throughout her contemporary's spiel. Another panelist, 5th grade Spanish teacher Daniel Alonso, echoed Slattery's sentiments, describing a similar incident between him and a set of parents at Chavez Elementary in Yonkers, New York.   'Similarly to what Kieran said,' said Alonso, referring to Slattery, 'in my school district, LGBTQ+ students have a bill of rights - and the fourth one is that they have the right to be referred to by their gender pronouns and a name that fits their gender identity. 'And so, similarly, there was a situation where a parent felt that the school was not doing what they wanted them to do, and we - I don't even know if we were respectful about it - we were just like, 'No, sorry. Like, our district-wide rule is that the student determines that, not you,'' he said, while offering a smug smile. Alonso - who organizers described as 'an advocate for all, lover of puppies, and redeemer of all things Mariah' - added: 'Even though you are the parents.' The final panelist, Maryland School Counselor Heather Eig, seemed in agreement with the others. 'Ours is the same - and again, it really speaks to where you're working, where the district is, the state laws, and really having the backing of your administration, and your superintendent, and the a district that says, 'This is our policy' - and I'm going to follow suit. A clip of the exchange shared to Twitter by journalist Colin Wright Tuesday quickly went viral, garnering more than 1,000 likes and hundreds of reshares. Observers shared their outrage over the panelists' assertions, calling them criminal and a gross overstep of public school staffers' authority. 'LAWSUITS,' one user wrote in all capital letters. 'This is a violation of the human and constitutional rights of parents.' Another user responded to Slattery's assertion that there was nothing parents could do when confronted with parents concerns over how teachers address their children. 'They could pull their child out of your class and demand another teacher. That's what they could do,' the observer wrote. A further user remarked on how it was unethical for teachers to be referring to a student by pronouns or names not known to the kids' parents of guardians.  'Teachers might spend around 1 or 2 hours a day, 5 days a week for 9 months with a student in a year. Parents will devote a major part of everyday to their kids for 18 years.  'Teachers shouldn't be keeping secrets with a child or keeping those same secrets from their parents,' they wrote. The panel's strong words come shortly after parents expressed outrage toward California school district after learning that male counselors who identify as non-binary were sleeping in the same rooms as fifth-grade girls at a school-organized science camp. In another instance in January, the parent of a 12-year-old Florida girl who tried to hang herself twice at her school after 'months of secret meetings about her gender identity' with school officials, slammed district staff for going behind their backs and 'creating a double life' for their daughter.  The parents subsequently filed a lawsuit contending staffers violated their parental rights by failing to inform them of the child's alleged gender identity crisis.

The reality star, real name Angela White, 34, filed a Statement of Disqualification against Judge Gregory Alarcon earlier this week, accusing him of being 'hostile and extremely biased' and not giving her a fair trial.  The legal action came days after a jury of seven women and five men found in favor of the Kardashian family in Chyna's lawsuit and did not award her any damages.  Chyna's legal team asked the chief justice of LA Superior Court to disqualify Judge Alarcon and remove him from her second, upcoming trial against ex Robert Kardashian.   But Judge Alarcon refused to refer the issue to his boss, and instead, decided himself to order that the request be 'stricken', ruling the motion 'discloses no legal grounds for disqualification'. He also hit back at Chyna's claims in a statement saying: 'I am not prejudiced or biased against or in favor of any party to this proceeding or their counsel. 'All rulings made by me in this action have been based upon facts and arguments officially presented to me and upon my understanding of the law.'  Chyna's attorney, Lynne Ciani, told DailyMail.com exclusively that she is now asking California's Court of Appeal to kick Judge Gregory Alarcon off the case.  She wants the judge removed from Chyna's upcoming trial against Kim Kardashian's brother Rob, who she accused of posting 'revenge porn' photos of her on the internet. 'Judge Alarcon did not permit the presiding judge or a different judge to rule in plaintiff's (Chyna's) comprehensive and meritorious statement of disqualification,' Ciani told DailyMail.com after the judge's decision.  'An unbiased judge would have allowed another Los Angeles Superior Court Judge to review plaintiff's statement of disqualification and decide for him or herself whether Judge Alarcon should have been disqualified. 'Instead, the biased judge ruled that he is not biased, thereby depriving Angela White of justice once again.' Ciani cited two of what she called 'the many blatant judicial errors' committed by Judge Alarcon during the trial involving four of the reality TV superstar clan - Kris and Kylie Jenner and Kim and Khloe Kardashian. One involved the judge's clerk allegedly asking the Kardashians for their autographs - which prompted her re-assignment to another courtroom. The other was Kardashians' attorney Michael Rhodes upsetting Chyna when he showed her nude pictures of herself while he was questioning her about a legal document during the trial. Judge Alarcon 'did nothing' about his clerk's 'misconduct' and 'egregious conflict of interest,' said Ciani - who also condemned the judge's 'abhorrent mishandling of Michael Rhodes' unlawful showing of naked photos of Ms. White to her during key cross-examination testimony.' In the trial that ended May 2, the Kardashian women were accused of defaming Chyna and intentionally interfering with her contract with the E! network for the show Rob and Chyna, leading to the Keeping Up with the Kardashians spinoff being canceled after only one season. But Judge Alarcon is also scheduled to preside soon over lawsuit against her Rob and Chyna co-star, Rob Kardashian, 35 - her former fiance and father of her five year-old daughter Dream - accusing him of posting 'revenge porn' nude photos of her on the internet after they had broken up. Now that the judge has denied her effort to have him kicked off the bench, Chyna, said Ciani, 'will be forced to file a Writ of Mandate....to ensure she receives a fair trial by removing Judge Alarcon from that case. 'Moreover, the Writ of Mandate will request that Judge Alarcon also be removed from being able to rule on any post-judgement motions in the defamation and intentional interference with contract case against Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner to ensure Ms. White is treated fairly in connection with any such post-judgment motions,' Cianni said in a statement. While jurors didn't completely exonerate the Kardashians in the trial that ended last week, they also didn't believe Chyna deserved any of the $108million in damages she was seeking.  It was that devastating defeat that prompted Ciani to file her motion to disqualify Judge Alarcon and blasted the Kardashians' attorney, Michael Rhodes who called the move 'a baseless effort to save face after losing at trial,' in court documents. In a written objection to Ciani's bid to have the judge removed from the case, he added that the motion 'is devoid of any legal basis to disqualify Judge Alarcon from presiding over further matters I'm this action. 'While plaintiff (Chyna) and her counsel, Lynne Ciani, are understandably disappointed about the jury's defense verdict following an emotionally charged trial, their effort to make a scapegoat of Judge Alarcon is frivolous, dishonest and deserving of sanctions,' Rhodes said.  'Highlighting the frivolity of plaintiff's disqualification motion is the fact that Ms. Ciani failed to file her motion until after the jury found against her client. 'This delay reveals the true motivation underlying plaintiff's motion: to salvage Ms. Ciani's reputation by deflecting blame for her own shortcomings at trial and generate further publicity for plaintiff. 'Far from any appearance of bias or prejudice, Judge Alarcon demonstrated considerable tolerance towards Ms. Ciani despite her failure to understand and apply basic rules of evidence.' Rhodes called Giani's judge disqualification request 'untimely' and went on: 'Plaintiff (Chyna) claims Judge Alarcon exhibited an 'undeniably hostile and extremely biased' attitude towards her and Ms. Ciani since April 19 and 20 - the day both sides presented opening arguments to the jury. 'Yet Plaintiff and her counsel nonetheless proceeded without complaint as Judge Alarcon presided over a 10-day trial. 'In the days and weeks that followed, plaintiff and her counsel had ample time to raise her completely misguided allegations about Judge Alarcon's impartiality.' Rhodes said the Kardashians 'have long maintained that the case and trial were part of a well-orchestrated publicity campaign. 'Plaintiff makes money as a so-called social media 'influencer' - as she admitted from the stand (as part of her absurd damages claims), the more 'real fans' she has on her social media accounts, the more potential money she can make.' Judge Alarcon has scheduled May 19 for a court conference to decide a date for the trial in Chyna's 'revenge porn' lawsuit.", "cba2cab44627395295172317f6732ce6bc85fc20eebe7225cef709fd": "A teenager has been rushed to hospital after being shot in south London.

Father Gustavo Trindade, 37, launched his vehicle into the thief, Angelo dos Santos, 40, who had allegedly stolen three hooded sweatshirts and a t-shirt from the Sao Sebastiao Church's parish house in the municipality of Santa Cruz Rio do Rio Pardo on Saturday. A security camera captured the priest speeding down the street in a white sedan before jumping the sidewalk and plowing into the thief and building. He subsequently reversed back into the avenue and sped away. Dos Santos was arrested and taken to a nearby hospital, where he remained hospitalized until Monday. Father Trindade was on the run until Wednesday when he appeared before the Santa Cruz Rio do Rio Pardo courthouse accompanied by two lawyers. Judge Pedro de Castro rejected a Civil Police request to hold the priest in pre-trial detention, arguing that he was not a flight risk. The incident certainly surprised Tatiane de Fatima and Alex Aparecido, who were married by Father Trindade, according to Brazilian news outlet G1. De Fatima said the priest calmed her down while she waited to tie the knot with Aparecido, whom she had been in a relationship for three and a half years 'Until then, I didn't know him, but he was super attentive, he laughed, he joked with us before and during the ceremony,' the bride said. 'He told me to stay calm down, that I was supposed to breathe, that everything would work out. He was super calm.' She added that most of the 100 guests had left the ceremony and she stuck around at the church to take additional photos when she learned of the accident without knowing that Father Trindade has been involved.

The warning from Dr Mark Schipp follows the re-emergence of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in Indonesia in the past week, as well as the detection of lumpy skin disease in March and African swine fever before that. 'The incursion of three of those diseases of concern into Indonesia in the past two or three years is of very significant concern.' The chief vet told AAP that the risk of FMD entering Australia has likely doubled as a result of the outbreak, with an assessment to be carried out over the next few weeks. The risk level currently sits at nine per cent. 'It reflects the substantial change in our biosecurity situation, we had Indonesia, Timor Leste and Papua New Guinea as a disease free buffer ... but we're losing that buffer.' Dr Schipp said all of the diseases are now present in Indonesia with some cases spreading across the region. 'We know if we had a foot and mouth disease outbreak in Australia it would be very difficult to respond to....and the trade impacts on Australia's livestock and loss of product exports would be absolutely immense,' Dr Schipp told AAP. Dr Schipp said the current vaccination program tackling lumpy skin disease in Indonesia 'does not seem to be effective' in stopping the disease spreading. There have also been reports that lumpy skin disease has established itself in areas beyond the Riau province in Sumatra. Dr Schipp spoke to AAP during a trip to Darwin where he has been meeting with the chief vets from across Australia to discuss the 'increased biosecurity threat' across Northern Australia. 'Foot and mouth disease has by far the largest impact in terms of trade and livestock exports because it affects so many hosts, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs and would have absolutely devastating consequences for animal agriculture in Australia.' Indonesia, which had been free of FMD for more than three decades, has recorded two large outbreaks in East Java and the other in Sumatra, with more than a thousand cattle involved in each location. Dr Schipp said there is the potential for the disease to spread further given the 'enormous' numbers of cattle in those areas. The chief vet said an ongoing shortage of vets in some regional parts of Australia poses a threat to biosecurity. 'A delay in detection will mean that the outbreak will be far larger and require much greater resources to respond to and we have less resources at the state and territory level than we've had for many many years.' The National Farmers' Federation told AAP if FMD spread to Australia it would cost agricultural and regional communities around $65 billion. 'Now we have diseases on our doorstep it's critical, it's almost like another 'Ruby Princess' moment for agriculture and Australia ...when one of these diseases hits our shores.' 'We need to be prepared.' The coalition has committed to invest more than $61 million in boosting the biosecurity frontline in Northern Australia, with over $590 million in new funding since the 2021-22 Budget. Labor released its agricultural policy on Thursday which criticised the Morrison government for under-resourcing the 'vital biosecurity system,' and promised to improve Australia's biosecurity capabilities. There was no dollar amount attached to the pledge.", "aa5e56009eed5a7675463463107c49fbdb1dd46845e13eabfcba3942": "The wife of a man accused of sexually assaulting a bridesmaid just days before their 2019 wedding has taken the stand to defend him. Nicole Norris, 30, testified in Monroe County, Pennsylvania court on Wednesday that one of her bridesmaids was 'conscious and aware' of what she was doing with her then-fiancee Daniel Carney, 30, when she caught the two of them in the shower on August 30, 2019, according to WNEP. The prosecutors, though, say Norris was not there the entire time the two of them were in the shower of the men's locker room at the Shawnee Inn in Smithfield Township, so she could not have fully known what had happened. The bridesmaid, an unnamed then-29-year-old woman from Oregon, claimed in the aftermath that, although she did not remember exactly what had happened, she had 'woken up' twice during the encounter. She said she remembers Carney grabbing and biting her, and later that her bikini bottoms were off and Carney was on top of her. Carney claims that the encounter was 'consensual' and insists that the bridesmaid actually initiated it.  He was later arrested for simple assault, involuntary assault and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse of an unconscious person. Carney is now standing trial for attempted rape and attempted sexual assault. The entire saga unraveled in August 2019 during a pre-wedding outing with members of Nicole and Daniel's wedding party. They had spent the days before the wedding drinking and rafting on the Delaware River in the Pocono Mountains, where the Maid of Honor claimed Carney and his friends had asked the unnamed bridesmaid to flash other boaters for free beer. By the time they got back to shore on August 30, Nicole reportedly noticed the bridesmaid was extremely intoxicated and had asked Daniel to help her out of the raft and into the parking lot, the Morning Call reports. But as everyone else got back to the hotel, they reportedly realized they had not seen Daniel and the bridesmaid, so Nicole went looking for them and found them in the shower of the men's locker room.  She reportedly then started screaming at Daniel, the bridesmaid later told the authorities, and ran out to tell the Maid of Honor what had happened. The Maid of Honor, who has not been named, testified on Tuesday that she told Nicole she should call off the wedding, WNEP reports, but two days later - on September 1 - the wedding went forward as planned. It is unclear whether the victim remained a bridesmaid in the wedding. But the day after the wedding, the bridesmaid went to police saying she felt 'extremely violated and upset,' and was checked out by local doctors and nurses.  Police later found that on the morning of the wedding, Carney had texted the bridesmaid saying he was sorry and he was happy to marry Nicole, as he also asked her to take the so-called morning after pill. 'I'm as happy as ever to marry Nicole, and I know this is terrible as well, but my d*** was out in the shower,' he wrote, according to the Washington Post.  'We never did do it, but would you consider taking Plan B to make damn certain just in case? There is almost no chance, but still. 'Please tell me yes, I'm begging you.'  They also reportedly found surveillance footage, which police said, showed Carney turning around and pulling her into the locker room as she was 'extremely unsteady' on her feet.  After the incident, Carney told authorities he 'felt like he was taken advantage of by the victim,' according to Morning Call, before ultimately admitting that he pulled her into the locker room. But in court on Wednesday, WNEP reports, Carney testified that the alleged victim followed him into the men's locker room. He also said she was conscious and the entire encounter was consensual, claiming that the bridesmaid followed him into the shower and they started kissing. Carney claims she initiated the sexual encounter, and reportedly admitted to asking her to take Plan B before the wedding, claiming Nicole asked him to text her about that. Doctors and nurses have also testified in the trial claiming that they saw the bridesmaid in the aftermath of the alleged sexual assault with bruises all over her body, and submitted ER records and charts into evidence. Prosecutors, though, say the injuries could have been from the rafting experience, as the girl admitted to falling three times, WFMZ reports. The trial was expected to wrap up on Thursday.

Naomi showed off the 1,000-acre farm during an episode of Oprah Winfrey's Where Are They Now? in 2016.  The Country Music Hall of Famer owned the Nashville-area property for nearly three decades. Her daughters, actress Ashley Judd and singer Wynonna Judd, also had houses on the property. 'Ashley lives right up over that hill, right up the road,' Naomi said in the interview, pointing toward her daughter's house. She shared that it took her exactly one minute to get from her house to Ashley's front door, adding: 'I timed it the other day.' 'And Miss Wynonna lives right over that hill,' she said, noting it took about six minutes to get to her elder daughter's house. Naomi referred to the property as her 'haven' and 'sanctuary,' noting that she 'called it Peaceful Valley the moment I laid eyes on it.' The 76-year-old singer shot herself at her Tennessee farm on April 30 - a day before being inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame - after battling her mental health, Ashley told Good Morning America on Thursday. Ashley, 54, and her sister Wynonna, 57 - who performed with Naomi for years in The Judds - first open up about her death at the Country Music Hall of Fame ceremony on May 1. Meanwhile Naomi's husband Larry Strickland, 76, has remained tight-lipped, releasing a short statement saying he was going through a 'heartbreaking time'. During the 2016 home tour, Naomi highlighted some of her favorite rooms in the house. 'This is where it all happens,' she said of the great room. The singer compared the room to a 'movie theater' and even pulled out a bowl of snacks she referred to as 'concessions.' Naomi also showed off her kitchen and dining area, parts of the home that were seemingly quite important to her.  'I do all my own cooking,' the country music superstar said, before sharing some of her celebrity daughters' favorite meals. 'Ashley wants the beef stroganoff [when she comes over and] Wynonna wants chicken continental.' Additionally, Naomi shared that a round dining table was a must-have because she wanted to create an environment for conversation and stimulating discussion. 'The kitchen table, you'll notice that it's round because I'm very democratic,' she shared. 'We want to be able to to face each other.' Naomi, who had been battling with her mental health for many years, shot herself in an upstairs room of the home. The upper level, with the exception of her deck, did not air in the Oprah segment. Her heartbroken daughter Ashley, in her first televised interview since Naomi's passing, shared details of her death on Thursday morning.  'She used a weapon...a firearm,' she revealed. 'So, that's the piece of information we're very uncomfortable sharing.' Ashley, who was visiting her mother's home on the family property the day she died, also detailed her last moments with Naomi. 'It was a mixed day,' Ashley said. 'I was at the house visiting, as I am every day, and mom said to me 'will you stay with me?' and I said: 'Of course I will.' The actress stepped outside to greet a family friend. When she went to notify her mother that their guest had arrived, she found her dead.  'I went upstairs to let her know that the friend was there and I discovered her,' Ashley shared. 'I have both grief and trauma from discovering her.' The actress, sharing the details of her mother's death before the release of her autopsy report, reiterated that Naomi was 'entitled to her dignity and her privacy' and they will not be disclosing anything else. Naomi took her own life the day before she and Wynonna were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. 'Our mother couldn't hang on until she was inducted into the Hall of Fame by her peers,' Ashley shared in the GMA interview, which aired Thursday.  'That is the level of catastrophe of what was going on inside of her, because the barrier between the regard in which they held her couldn't penetrate into her heart and the lie the disease told her was so convincing.'  Despite the family's immense grief, Wynonna attended the induction ceremony on May 1. 'I didn't prepare anything tonight because I knew Mom would probably talk the most,' Wynonna told the audience attending the Nashville ceremony. 'I'm gonna make this fast, because my heart's broken, and I feel so blessed. It's a very strange dynamic, to be this broken and this blessed.... Though my heart's broken, I will continue to sing, because that's what we do.'   Naomi struggled with her mental health for many years, having previously admitted to undergoing electro-shock therapy and considering suicide in recent years.   'Mom was a brilliant conversationalist. She was a star, an underrated songwriter, and she was someone who suffered from mental illness, who had trouble getting off the sofa,' Ashley shared. 'But her brain hurt. It physically hurt. 'When you're talking about mental illness, it's important to make the distinction between the loved one and the disease,' she said. 'My mother knew that she was seen and she was heard in her anguish and she was walked home.'  'I really accepted the love my mother was capable of giving me because I knew she was fragile.  'I savored those moments and every time we hugged and she drank me in, I was very present for those tactile experiences because I knew there would come a time when she would be gone, whether it was sooner or whether it was later, whether it was by the disease or another cause.'  Naomi had written extensively about her struggles with depression, and even referenced suicide in an open letter published in People magazine in 2018. 'For everyone mourning the death of someone who committed suicide, an inevitable question arises: Why did this happen? Unfortunately, we don't have very good answers,' she wrote. 'We do know that suicidal behavior accompanies many behavioral brain disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Suicide is actually one of the leading causes of preventable death among these mental illnesses.'  In her 2018 essay, Naomi Judd advocated for more research into the nature of suicide.   'To understand this issue better, we have to bring the study of suicide into mainstream neuroscience and treat the condition like every other brain disorder,' she wrote.  'People who commit suicide are experiencing problems with mood, impulse control and aggression, all of which involve discrete circuits in the brain that regulate these aspects of human experience, but we still don't understand how these circuits go haywire in the brains of suicide victims.' She described what depression feels like to her in an interview with People magazine while promoting her 2016 book. 'Nobody can understand it unless you've been there,' she said. 'Think of your very worst day of your whole life - someone passed away, you lost your job, you found out you were being betrayed, that your child had a rare disease - you can take all of those at once and put them together and that's what depression feels like. She told the Today Show in 2017 that after The Judds stopped touring, she didn't get off the couch for two years, falling into  'extreme' and 'severe' depression. '[Fans] see me in rhinestones, you know, with glitter in my hair, that really is who I am,' she said. 'But then I would come home and not leave the house for three weeks, and not get out of my pyjamas, and not practice normal hygiene. It was really bad. 'When I came off the tour I went into this deep, dark absolutely terrifying hole and I couldn't get out,' she added. 'I spent two years on my couch.' She said she even scouted out a bridge near her family's farm to jump from.  'That's how bad it can get,' she said. 'It's hard to describe. You go down in this deep, dark hole of depression and you don't think that there's another minute.' She said that one night, her husband and daughter Ashley called 911 and she entered therapy, eventually undergoing ECT (electroshock therapy) to 'jump start' the chemicals in her brain.  The mother-daughter performers scored 14 No. 1 songs in a career that spanned nearly three decades. After rising to the top of country music, the duo called it quits in 1991 after doctors diagnosed Naomi with hepatitis. The Judds' hits included Love Can Build a Bridge in 1990, Mama He's Crazy in 1984, Why Not Me in 1984, Turn It Loose in 1988, Girls Night Out in 1985, Rockin' With the Rhythm of the Rain in 1986 and Grandpa in 1986. The pair last performed together at the CMT Music Awards of April 11, singing Love Can Build a Bridge. They were accompanied by a gospel choir.  The Judds had also recently announced a farewell tour, the first by Naomi and Wynonna in more than a decade.  The short, 10-date tour, which was being produced by Sandbox Live and Live Nation, was to start on September 30 in Grand Rapids, Michigan and wrap up October 28 at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena.  They first got attention singing on Ralph Emery's morning show in early 1980, where the host named them the 'Soap Sisters' because Naomi said she used to make her own soap. After the success of 'Mama He's Crazy,' they won the Horizon Award at the 1984 CMA Awards. Naomi started her speech by saying, 'Slap the dog and spit in the fire!' Daughter Ashley Judd is an actress known for her roles in such movies as 'Kiss the Girls,' 'Double Jeopardy' and 'Heat.' Larry Strickland, who was a backup singer for Elvis Presley, was married to Naomi Judd for 32 years.", "fcff02cc5b703bd4281dd330e6a3de626e8d8606a0df610a18f09728": "Vicky White spoke of the importance of staying 'on the straight and narrow' just hours before the veteran corrections officer sprang Casey White from jail and walked out on her life and 17 years of unblemished service, DailyMail.com can reveal. Speaking exclusively to DailyMail.com, Deborah Burbank, who counted Vicky as a lifelong friend, revealed, 'My daughter saw Vicky that morning and she said she acted like she always did.' Burbank explained that her daughter, who did not wish to be named, had been in trouble with the law before and spent time in Lauderdale County Jail in Florence, Alabama. On Friday April 29, the day of 38-year-old White's escape, Burbank's daughter was at the jail visiting a friend when she ran into Vicky who was on shift in her capacity as assistant director of corrections. Burbank said, 'Vicky spoke to my daughter and said how proud she was of her for getting her life back on track. She said how important it was to stay on the straight and narrow. 'We've spoken about it since, and she's thought about it, but she says Vicky was just like she always was. She gave no indication that anything was up. We're all just shook.' Today Burbank, 57, who grew up just two miles from Vicky, 56, and went to both elementary and high school with her, is struggling to believe that the woman she knew for more than five decades could have blindsided her so completely. She said, 'Vicky was just a good person. She was always supportive, always helping people - my daughter, nephews, friends. She would do anything for anyone. 'And she was always a good girl, a family girl. When we were younger, I would smoke weed and drink. Vicky never participated in any of that, but she was still my friend.' According to Burbank, Vicky did not go into the prison service because she felt any vocation but simply because a friend had told her that there were jobs going at Lauderdale County Jail. She said, 'She applied, and she enjoyed her work. She took great pride in it.' Burbank revealed that prisoners held a prayer vigil for Vicky at the jail on Tuesday night after learning of her death. She said, 'There's a lot who are angry with Casey and blame him for this.' Casey, who was arraigned on the charge of Escape in the First Degree Tuesday night, is now being held in the maximum security William E Donaldson Correctional Facility in Jefferson County, Alabama. He is due to stand trial on a capital murder trial next month. As for Vicky's motivations Burbank said, 'The only thing I can think is that you just don't know where your heart can lead you.  'I should know I've had four awful husbands. 'Vicky only had one and she stayed friends with him to the end. I guess we can all fall in love and do crazy things.' But however confused Burbank is by her friend's actions she is certain of one thing. She said, 'Vicky was not suicidal. She did not deliberately pull that trigger and shoot herself. 'You can hear on that (911) tape. Vicky was not suicidal when they got up to her.' If anything, Burbank said, the audio released by Vanderburgh County Sheriff's Department appears to suggest that Vicky was concerned with the couple's safety. She can be heard saying, 'Stop, stop...the airbags will go off and kill us.' According to law enforcement Vicky was driving and had a gun in her right hand. At one point an officer can be heard stating that Vicky 'has her finger on the trigger.' It is unclear if Vicky was holding the weapon when the car careened off the road in Evansville, Indiana, and into a ditch having been rammed by officers who gave chase in the brief multi-vehicle pursuit that ended the fugitive couple's stint on the lam. They had made it less than 300 miles before deciding they had driven enough and, according to Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding, holed up in an old Motel 6 - now called Motel 41 - to mull over their next move. Burbank is adamant, 'You can hear Vicky hollering, ''Casey.'' She was talking about getting up and running. She was not suicidal. I don't care if they say they found the gun in her hand, I do not believe she pulled the trigger and shot herself on purpose. 'None of this makes any sense to me but whatever she did I just can't believe that.' The couple's days as fugitives came to an end with Vicky's death from a gunshot wound moments after their car was rammed off the road and into a ditch.  The pair were carrying $29,000 in cash, four handguns and an AR-15 rifle and were prepared for a shootout when they were captured, an Indiana sheriff said on Tuesday. The end of the manhunt left authorities trying to piece together what happened during the 11 days that elapsed after Vicky White escorted Casey White from a Florence, Alabama, jail for what she falsely claimed was a mental health evaluation. She also told her coworkers that she felt ill and planned to see a doctor afterward.  No one realized that the two were missing until around 3.30pm.  The inmate and Vicky appeared to have had a jailhouse romance, Alabama authorities said last week. Despite sharing a last name, they were not related. As for Vicky's role in the escape, Vanderburgh County sheriff Dave Wedding said: 'He was not forcing her. It was a mutual relationship.' At the time of the breakout, Casey White was serving a 75-year prison sentence for attempted murder and other offenses and was awaiting trial on charges of stabbing a woman to death during a 2015 burglary.  If convicted, he could get the death penalty. Investigators believe the pair spent about six days holed up at in the Motel 41.  Authorities discovered wigs intended to hide their identities.  Sheriff Wedding said investigators do not believe the two had relatives or other contacts in Evanston which is in southwest Indiana, close to both the Kentucky and Illinois borders. 'They thought they'd driven long enough. They wanted to stop for a while, get their bearings straight and then figure out the next place to travel,' the sheriff said. Authorities closed in on them after the manager of a car wash reported that a man closely resembling the giant 260-pound Casey White had been recorded by a surveillance camera getting out of a pickup truck. Investigators said they located the pickup, then learned that the pair may have switched to a Cadillac, which was then spotted outside a motel nearby.  They arrived in Evansville on May 3 and were helped by a local man whose identity remains unknown. He booked them into the $44-a-night motel, so they avoided going to the front desk where they might have been recognized. Casey White told investigators after his capture that 'he was probably going to have a shootout at the stake of both of them losing their lives,' the sheriff said. Audiotape of a 911 call shows Vicky blamed Casey for their capture in her last moments. 'You had to stay in some f***ing motel,' she is heard saying. The inmate appeared by video Tuesday in an Indiana courtroom, where he waived extradition. He was sent back to Florence and appeared in court there on Tuesday. He was remanded to the William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility, a maximum security lock-up near Bessemer, Alabama.  Vicky White, assistant director of corrections at the Lauderdale County jail, had put in for retirement ahead of the escape, and the day of the breakout, April 29, was her last day of work. She had been honored by her workmates who voted her employee of the year for the fifth time in her career.   April 18: Jail guard Vicky White sells her Lexington, Alabama, home. Public records revealed she sold the property for $95,550, which was below market value. She started living with her mother after the sale. April 28: Vicky submits retirement paperwork to officials at Lauderdale County Jail. According to Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton, she had been discussing her retirement for many months and 'talked about going to the beach'. Pre-prison break: In the week ahead of the escape (specific dates unknown) Vicky purchases men's clothing at a Kohl's store and visits a sex shop. It is unclear if she bought anything at the adult toy store. Lauderdale County District Attorney Chris Connolly claims she also withdrew $90,000 in cash out of a series of bank accounts.

She tells the booking officer that she is the only deputy available who is firearm-certified and that she's dropping him off to other deputies at the courthouse. Vicky says she's then going to Med Plus for a personal appointment. 9.49am: Surveillance video shows Vicky's police cruiser parked at the nearby Florence Square shopping center parking lot eight minutes after leaving the jail. 'There was not enough time for them to even attempt to try to come to the courthouse,' Sheriff Rick Singleton said. 11.34am: A Florence Police Department officer spots her cruiser. 3.30pm: Booking officer reports to administration that they've been trying to contact Vicky to check on her, and that her phone is going directly to voice mail. The officer also says that Casey was not returned to the detention center with other inmates.

Ramon Rotestan, 39, had been out on parole just six weeks before Monday's horrifying attack, after serving 16 years behind bars for a previous rape, The New York Post reported.  He turned himself into cops on Thursday and was filmed being perp-walked after being hit with the latest sexual assault charge he faces. Police said the suspect followed the woman into the elevator of her Bronx apartment building located in the area of Bolton Street and Lydig Avenue in Pelham Parkway  Video surveillance captured inside the elevator shows the knife-wielding suspect speaking to the victim before robbing and raping her at knifepoint.  At one point when the elevator stops at the second floor, the suspect is seen looking directly into the camera before scoping out the area to ensure they were alone, before pulling out a condom and performing the violent sex act.  The suspect robbed the woman, who appeared to hand over her wallet, of $112 before fleeing the scene. Crime on the streets of New York is at a record high with robbery up 44.5 percent, felony assaults 19 percent, rape 12 percent, and overall crimes a staggering 41.26 percent making many New Yorkers feel uneasy. During Monday night's rape and robbery on an innocent woman, NYC Mayor Eric Adams, 61,  was busy attending a celebrity-filled annual fundraiser for the Robin Hood Foundation, hob-nobbing with guests including, Jeff Bezos and comedian John Mulaney, at the Javits Center in midtown Manhattan.                    After the unprovoked attack, the victim was taken to Jacobi Medical Center for treatment, The New York Post reported.    It is yet another shocking incidence of crime in the rotten Big Apple where rape, assault and robbery have all soared.  Yet, on the same evening as the harrowing rape of a woman at her own apartment building, New York City's party-loving Mayor Adams was rubbing shoulders with celebrities at a star-studded fundraiser which included the likes of Jeff Bezos. Comedian John Mulaney, the night's entertainment at the Robin Hood Foundation's annual benefit gala at the Javits Center in midtown Manhattan, ripped into Adams, 61. The Grammy-winning comic took aim at the mayor's reputation as a jet-setting party boy, joking that he traveled so much he didn't live in NYC. 'I love Mayor Adams. He's done so much good for the city that he's thinking of moving here,' Mulaney quipped.  Last week, the mayor has left his crime-plagued city to hobnob with billionaires and comedians on the West Coast .  The cop-turned-politician flew to Los Angeles last weekend for a three-day jaunt in Tinsel Town, he says, to drum up positive press and business for the Big Apple. During his trip, which included catching Dave Chappelle's show at the Hollywood Bowl, he was seen at a dinner at the hyper-cool, members-only San Vincente Bungalows hosted by top Hollywood agent Cade Hudson, according to Page Six. A source told Page Six that the soiree was 'to welcome the mayor to L.A.' Meanwhile, crime continues to rise across the Big Apple despite Adams' promises to crack down on the already surging numbers under predecessor Bill de Blasio. Through May 1, overall crime is up 41 percent in New York City from the same period in 2021. While murders are down 14 percent, robberies are up 44 percent and felony assaults are up 19 percent. In January 2022, Mayor Adams unveiled a comprehensive plan to combat the surge in crime, which included increased foot patrols as well as the revival of a plain clothes unit named Neighborhood Safety Teams. The mayor also launched his Subway Safety plan in February, which sent 1,000 officers with health care partners to crackdown on homelessness and crime in the city's transit system. Yet the initiatives have bore little fruits as crime continues to rise, with murder and rape being the only crimes to see a down tick between April 2022 and April 2021. The NYPD reported 31 murders last month, a 38 percent drop from the 50 last year, and rapes fell by 6 percent, with 109 cases reported in April. Adams' jet-setter and celebrity groupie status seems to be at odds with his image of an outer borough guy, raised by a single mom who was house cleaner. He's talked about being beaten up by police before he went on to join the NYPD and rising to the rank of captain. 'I am just a blue-collar guy scraping along,' he once told Politico. 'I'm potentially the first blue-collar mayor.' But that hasn't stopped him leaving his city and its problems behind to mingle with the stars.  During his most recent LA trip, he enjoyed dinner at the exclusive San Vincente Bungalows, hosted by top Hollywood agent Cade Hudson. The San Vincente Bungalows, which was started by Klein in 2019, has a 750 members comprised of what the New York Times referred to as 'apex predators' like Steven Spielberg and Netflix CEO and husband of Avant, Ted Sarandos. The annual dues costing $4,200 for members over 35, $1,800 for those younger. Screenwriter Jon Robin Baitz told the Times the decor was 'a cross between a glorious English cottage, Bugsy Siegel's hide-out and Bemelmans bar.' The club is so private that camera lenses of all cell phones are covered with a sticker when members enter and photography is forbidden. Adams has been known to attend Zero Bond, the downtown Manhattan members-only club. He's chided New Yorkers for staying in, saying the Big Apple has become 'so boring' in March. 'I want to become a city of excitement again,' he said. The mayor also took heat from political pundits for jetting out of the city too often while the city suffers through a rise in crime. He's been to Miami, Chicago, Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Los Angeles in the first few months in office. Adams sees no contradiction in stepping out at night and fighting crime in the city. He combined the two themes recently at the ultra-swank Met Gala after returning from his L.A. trip. During the red-carpet event, Adams wore a custom-made tuxedo jacket with the words 'End Gun Violence' emblazoned on the back.' 'We need to keep that in the forefront as we enjoy the financial ecosystem,' he told the New York Times. 'Several people cautioned him against doing too many trips because it will hurt,' Karen Hinton, ex-press secretary for Mayor Bill de Blasio, told NY1 News. Adams also attended a tech conference held by Milken Institute Global Conference, but back home New Yorkers worried about the increase in gun violence. While he was gone, a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University found that his approval rating had dropped three points to 43 percent with 54percent of New York City voters saying he's not doing a great job curbing crime.", "523b08253c7e492ce98fcaef0074b6e28aaa8e242e2382daf0a1b46d": "An Air Force crew has been disciplined for landing a Hercules aircraft at Martha's Vineyard to pick up a vintage BMW motorcycle one of them owned. The crew from the 403rd Wing of the Hurricane Hunters in Mississippi have been punished for 'abusing government assets' after they were seen loading up the vintage bike onto their aircraft on March 25.  The five-person team was reportedly downgraded after Air Force leadership found out about the excursion on March 27, according to CNN Politics, meaning each member lost ratings or credentials that they will have to earn back and could potentially push them under their required number of flight hours to be able to fly. The military also grounded the men, forcing another crew to pick up the members and the aircraft, according to KFOR 4 News.  'We hold our reservists to the highest standards of conduct and these actions are not tolerated,' Colonel Stuart Rubio, the commander of the 403rd Wing, said in a statement, viewed by CNN Politics.  The crew reportedly left Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi, where their wing is based, and traveled to Quonset Air National Guard Base in Rhode land on March 24.  A day later, they made an unscheduled, 15-minute stop at Martha's Vineyard on March 25 to pick up their loot. The crew continued on their scheduled route to Mather, California, where they picked up equipment for an atmospheric river mission.  'While performing an off-station training mission, a US Air Force Reserve crew with the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, 403rd Wing, Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, made an unplanned stop at Martha's Vineyard Airport, Massachusetts, March 24,' Lieutenant Colonel Marnee Losurdo told the Martha's Vineyard Times in March.  While at the famous vineyard, the crew was seen by witnesses loading up a 1970 BMW R75/5 motorcycle that belonged to one of the crew members, CNN Politics reported. The bike reportedly remains in California, the Sun Herald reported.   Witnesses, who were dining at the Plane View Restaurant, were astonished to see a massive Hercules aircraft touching down briefly on the runway.  Doug Ulwick, described the plane as 'freaking huge' and he watched the crew dropped the cargo ramp and collect the motorcycle before quickly taking off agan.  'We heard the noise before we saw the plane. [You] don't see that everyday,' he posted on his social media, according to the Martha's Vineyard Times.  Tristan Israel, a county commissioner, told the Martha's Vineyard Times: 'I saw a vintage BMW motorcycle. I used to own old vintage BMW motorcycles, so that's how I know.  'I was eating next to the window. We looked out and we saw the plane. We saw people walking a vintage motorcycle up to the plane.'   The airport can support all kinds of jet, but is mainly used by private, small aircrafts. Although, major airlines like Delta, American, and Jet Blue do fly into the airport seasonally. The almost 700-acre airfield has two runways. For reference, a large airport, like JFK, sits on almost 5,000 acres.  DailyMail.com has reached out to the Air Force for comment.

The drug's mood-altering and hallucinogenic effects are well known - and Khan has already shown he's amenable to ending Britain's ban on marijuana. Despite going to LA on a 'fact-finding' mission to learn how the city had fared since recreational marijuana became legal in California in 2018, there were signs the Labour politician was looking to be impressed. For while the ownership, management and staffing of America's multi-billion-dollar legal marijuana industry is 98 per cent white - prompting many African-Americans to complain they are being excluded from the pot 'gold rush' - Khan visited one of the handful of black-run businesses that has managed to thrive. At the Gorilla Rx Wellness cannabis dispensary, he heard good news about how legalisation can empower black people.  That's exactly what the young voters probably want to hear, as polls show they are in favour of marijuana legalisation in general. But if Khan is envisaging similar businesses springing up in London, there is another side of the trade that he should take into account. Had the mayor looked a little further afield, he would have found a very different story -as I did when I recently visited LA following reports that, far from flourishing, its legal cannabis industry is on its knees. At The Higher Path, a cannabis shop in the affluent suburb of Sherman Oaks, customers sit in a waiting room festooned with potted plants while staff check your ID to ensure you are 21 and haven't reached your daily one-ounce cannabis purchasing limit. You are then buzzed through a steel door by an armed security guard into an Aladdin's Cave of cannabis products: cannabis-laced soft drinks, 'tinctures', chocolate, chewy sweets, vapes and the dried plant itself.  As a business it looks impressive, and yet its owner, Jerred Kiloh, told me he was struggling to stay afloat, along with the rest of the city's licensed pot trade. For these legal traders are surrounded - and heavily outnumbered - by unlicensed and illegal cannabis dispensaries that sell almost identical-looking products at half the price. The same goes for an army of cannabis delivery services. They don't sell authorised cannabis made by California's tightly controlled and heavily taxed 8,000 licensed growers, but untaxed and untested pot that may contain harmful additives or be dangerously potent. Additives have been found to include a pesticide, Eagle 20, that releases highly toxic formaldehyde and mustard gas when heated. Checks on buyers' IDs and ages are perfunctory or non-existent while the supposedly tamper-proof packaging and clear labelling of the cannabis products - including a government health warning - is either missing or counterfeit. Occasionally, police raid these dispensaries, but brazen owners re-open them within days. This largely unchecked black-market activity has brought the legal cannabis industry to the brink of collapse. Mr Kiloh, head of the United Cannabis Business Association, predicts half of the state's 823 legal pot shops will have closed within a year.  Most are surviving only by selling some of their cannabis on the black market. 'Nobody is making money anywhere in the legal supply chain,' Mr Kiloh told me. He blames the state's legalisation law, which taxes marijuana so heavily that the price of an eighth of marijuana doubled virtually overnight from $30 (PS24) to $60 (PS49). Naturally, many customers continued to buy it illegally for half the price.  And the mess in California is being repeated in other states such as Oklahoma, Washington and Michigan, which have also legalised the drug. While 18 states have allowed marijuana for recreational use, usually after convincing voters it will be a huge tax earner, California remains the world's biggest single recreational marijuana market, worth some PS11.5billion a year, including the legal and illegal drug. One of the justifications for legalisation was that it would benefit black people, who have suffered most from it being criminalised.  However, African-American cannabis entrepreneurs have been among those hit hardest, many complaining that they've lost all their money trying to run a legal business. About 80 to 90 per cent of California's cannabis market remains illegal. Last year, the state seized more than 1.2million illegal cannabis plants. Contrary to the airy platitudes of proponents in both the UK and US about legalisation driving down crime, drug criminals are thriving. Californians were assured that legalising dope would 'incapacitate the black market'. In fact, it has invigorated it. Drug cartels had before stayed out of California's illicit marijuana trade as the drug was too cheap and had too many suppliers.  But now that legal cannabis is relatively expensive, the ruthless gangs see the potential to make a fortune. Cannabis-related violent crime has soared. During a single spree over one weekend last November, armed robbers raided 25 licensed dispensaries in Oakland, near San Francisco, stealing large amounts of marijuana and shooting at staff and police. And yet, because Left-wing state prosecutors have changed the law to make cultivating illegal marijuana a less serious crime, offenders can expect to be let off with no more than a $1,000 (PS820) fine.  Cannabis businesses complain that the police usually aren't interested in making arrests. Complicating the nightmare, most consumers say they don't know the difference between what's legal and illegal. The scale of the disaster may not have yet filtered through to the mayor of London, but the cannabis crisis in California should give pause for thought. America's thriving pot black market is not the only lesson that the mayor can take home.  Another worrying misconception is that cannabis is essentially harmless or even - based on evidence of its usefulness as a painkiller - benign. Some US doctors were always worried the country had moved too fast in legalising cannabis when little was known about its health effects.  Those fears have only grown: experts are increasingly alarmed about the drug's links with mental health problems, with possible damage to brain development in young users and evidence that using it vastly increases the risk of developing schizophrenia and other mental disorders. It's also thought to be responsible for an alarming condition known as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) or 'scromiting', a gastrointestinal illness in which victims start vomiting uncontrollably.  Studies suggest up to 12.5 per cent of the US's regular cannabis users suffer from it. And despite the pro-cannabis lobby's insistence that the drug isn't addictive, the number of Americans describing their heavy use of it as a 'disorder' has doubled since the early 2000s, says to the US's National Institutes of Health. Health experts are worried about the increasingly potent cannabis variants that are available.  In January, Sir Robin Murray, of King's College London, said 'the increased potency of cannabis means it is no longer a relatively safe drug'. He said that the growing strength of ultra-potent forms of the drug called 'skunk' - which dominates the UK market and which is still half the strength of many variants on sale in California dispensaries - was responsible for the UK having 'among the highest rates of psychosis in Europe'. He also warned parents underestimate the mental health risks posed by ultra-strong cannabis, revealing that skunk causes a third of the psychosis cases he sees at his south London practice. Sir Robin noted that in the US states that have legalised cannabis, the price has fallen, potency has shot up and 'both cannabis use and addiction have increased'. Sadiq Khan will hopefully have seen that if even California, birthplace of the hippie utopia, cannot make legal pot work, there may need to be another solution to Britain's drug problem. The capital is in total gridlock, crime is out of control... yet the Labour mayor is posing in an LA cannabis factory By Claire Ellicott, Political Correspondent for The Daily Mail  Priti Patel yesterday slapped down London mayor Sadiq Khan after he announced a 'commission' to look at decriminalising cannabis in Britain. The Home Secretary pointed out that Mr Khan has 'no power' to legalise illicit substances, and said his time would be 'better spent' focusing on tackling drug and knife crime in the capital. It came after the mayor praised the 'high standards' of legalised cannabis farms in California during a taxpayer-funded US tour. He also said he was launching a new London Drugs Commission, headed by former justice secretary Lord Falconer QC, to consider the decriminalisation of the class B drug in Britain. The body will examine research from University College London, but will not look at changing the law on class A drugs. Mr Khan said an 'honest, open' conversation was needed about UK cannabis laws and he hopes the panel will look at 'what happens elsewhere in the world where the laws have been changed'. But Miss Patel said: 'Sadiq Khan's time would be better spent focusing on knife and drug crime in London.  The mayor has no powers to legalise drugs. They ruin communities, tear apart families and destroy lives.' During his four-day tour to the US, billed as a 'fact-finding mission', Mr Khan visited a Los Angeles cannabis dispensary and farm as well as a shop that sold products infused with the drug. Describing the farm as 'heavily regulated', he said: 'It's important to see for ourselves what the parallel world of legalised cannabis looks like as a compare and contrast.'  He added: 'Hearing from those who cultivate and grow this plant has been fascinating.' Once the commission has completed its work, it will make recommendations to London's City Hall, the Government, the police, and public health services. Labour distanced itself from the plans, with a spokesman saying the party 'does not support changing the law on drugs'. About 2.6million people in the UK used cannabis in the year to March 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics, and the main drug offence recorded in England and Wales last year was 'possession of cannabis', Mr Khan's spokesman said the mayor's flights were provided free by United Airlines, adding: 'The mayor is committed to keeping the costs of the visit to a bare minimum and maximising value for money.'

The details of the arrest remain unclear, but he remains in police custody on a no-bond hold.  'Professional football player Jerry Jeudy has been arrested by Arapahoe Co sheriff deputies,' read a tweet from the Arapahoe County (Colorado) Sheriff account. 'He's being held at the Arapahoe Co jail on charges of 2nd degree criminal tampering w/a domestic violence enhancer, a misdemeanor. He's on a no bond hold. He's innocent until proven guilty.' Deputies took Jeudy into custody around noon.  A police spokesman did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment, nor did spokespeople for the Broncos or any of the agents representing Jeudy.  A first-round pick out of Alabama in 2020, Jeudy has appeared in 26 games over two NFL seasons, while recording 90 catches for 1,323 yards and three touchdowns. He's expected to be a major part of the Broncos' offense this season following the acquisition of quarterback Russell Wilson, a nine-time Pro Bowl selection, from Seattle.   Jeudy is not known for being in trouble with the law. He was reportedly a straight-A student his senior year of high school in Florida and a LexisNexis search only revealed a few traffic violations, some of which were dismissed. In college he was teammates with Henry Ruggs III, who is awaiting trial on drunk driving charges following his November 2 crash that killed 23-year-old Tina Tintor and her dog in Las Vegas.

The Washington Free Beacon visited five harm reduction organizations in New York City, Boston, Richmond, Va., Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, and every single one included crack pipes in their safe smoking kits.  All of the centers were non-profit health organizations and governmental agencies, exactly the types of groups eligible to apply for funding under the Biden administration's $30 million grant program.  Asked if there were steps in place to prevent organizations from using these dollars for crack pipes on Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: 'This is a conspiracy theory being spread out there.' While the Biden administration has not announced whether any of these groups will receive federal funding, many safe smoking kits distributed by such groups include crack pipes, and it remains to be seen if the Biden administration will filter out groups that do.  Contents of safe smoking kits vary from one organization to another, and not all may contain crack pipes. All of the five organizations the Free Beacon visited included not only crack pipes in their kits but also utensils to use heroine, cocaine and crystal methamphetamine, without requiring any sort of rehabilitation along with the free drug kits.  None of these five specific groups responded to requests for comment about whether they applied for the federal grant. The Biden administration is set to announce grant recipients on May 15.   The kits also often include sanitary items for addicts to utilize when using to mitigate the spread of disease.  A survey by the Free Beacon of two dozen other harm reduction organizations found that not all distribute safe smoking kits, but those that do typically include crack pipes. The few that don't include them said they are willing to but don't have the resources to do so.   The kits drew bitter condemnation from Republicans after a Free Beacon report in February signaled that the $30 million program would go towards safe smoking kits that included crack pipes.  The White House repeatedly denied that any funding under the program would go towards crack pipes.  'They were never a part of the kit,' said press secretary Jen Psaki of crack pipes. 'It was inaccurate reporting.' 'We've been very clear that we are not providing funding for crack pipes,' Psaki added in a later press briefing, calling the matter 'an issue that is not an issue.'  The affair began when a Health and Human Services (HHS) spokesperson reportedly told the Washington Free Beacon that included in these kits these kits could be pipes for users to smoke substances like crack cocaine and crystal methamphetamine, or 'any illicit substance.'  Days later HHS put out a statement contradicting its previously reported remarks. 'No federal funding will be used directly or through subsequent reimbursement of grantees to put pipes in safe smoking kits. The goal of harm reduction is to save lives.' The statement said that HHS will instead prioritize the 'use of proven harm reduction strategies like providing naloxone, fentanyl test strips, and clean syringes.' Asked what the safe smoking kits might contain Psaki said at the time: 'alcohol swabs, lip balm, other materials to promote hygiene and reduce the transmission of diseases like HIV and hepatitis.' 'I would note that what we're really talking about here is steps that we're taking as a federal government to address the opioid epidemic,' Psaki added. HHS could not be reached for comment on a comprehensive list of allowable items, but such kits also typically include a rubber mouthpiece to prevent cuts and burns, brass screens to filter contaminants and disinfectant wipes, according to Harm Reduction International.  And as Republicans mounted for a fight putting forth bills to ban the distribution of crack pipes, HHS Sec. Xavier Becerra said in a statement that no federal funding 'will be used directly or through subsequent reimbursement of grantees to put pipes in safe smoking kits.' Also funded under the grant are harm reduction vending machines, including stock for the machines, medication to reverse a drug overdose, medication lock boxes, infectious disease testing kits, safe sex kits, medication and needle disposal kits, vaccination services and wound care supplies. The $30 million Harm Reduction Program grant is funded through the 2021 American Rescue Plan, and therefore is 'not subject to the same syringe funding restrictions as other federal grants,' HHS says. The grant program lasts three years and includes 25 awards of up to $400,000. It is against the law to sell or distribute drug paraphernalia - including such pipes - unless authorized by state, local or federal law. After the administration's adamant denial that it would fund the pipes, the Drug Policy Alliance said the decision to 'remove pipes from safe smoking equipment is deeply disappointing.' 'This is a missed opportunity to be preventative of more deaths due to overdose,' the group wrote on Twitter. 'Giving clean drug-using equipment such as a pipe & syringe reduces transmission of disease including Hep. C & HIV.' 'Harm reduction works to meet people where they are at, and keep people free of diseases and alive so they have a chance of recovery and healing,' the group added.", "324e6070124f2ceb5e2dff17539c40d43b8a9dd94f513f6d021d9466": "Eric Adams has warned New Yorkers that they should be 'very afraid' of what will happen in their city if the Supreme Court strikes down a long-held state law requiring gun owners to have a license in order to carry a firearm.  America's highest court - which has come under fire in recent weeks for a leaked draft that would overturn women's federal abortion rights - is expected to issue a decision in the case, brought by a New York gun group that wants the permit law repealed, in the coming weeks. The law the group seeks to repeal took effect in 1911, and requires licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed.  During a press conference in Harlem Thursday, Adams told reporters that he suspects the court will toss the century-old gun guidance. 'After what we saw the Supreme Court did on abortion,' Adams said, 'we should be very afraid.' The tough-on-crime mayor went on to explain how he believes cities like New York are being overlooked by lawmakers looking to nix the law - which requires Big Apple residents to obtain a concealed carry permit before being allowed to carry a gun on the city's streets. 'In densely populated communities like New York, this ruling could have a major impact on us,' Adams, 61, said, before adding that his team was exploring potential ways to respond to the expected ruling.   'We are now looking with our legal experts to see what we can do,' said Adams, who campaigned last year on cleaning up the city's crime-ridden streets. 'But we should all be concerned.'  The lawsuit behind the looming guidance was filed by the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association (NYSRPA) last year, and was sent to the US' top court in November after being dismissed by New York's circuit court - the second tier of the country's court system.      The suit argues the licensing law comes in violation of the Second Amendment, since it only allows concealed carry permits to be issued to those who can show 'proper cause' for keeping a hidden weapon on their person in public - a stipulation that is rarely met by gunowners applying for the permit.     During oral arguments in the case last year, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito - the jurist who penned the leaked Roe vs. Wade repeal draft - conceded that it was not fair that 'law-abiding people' are barred from carrying firearms on the city's crime-riddled subway system, while lawbreakers continue to carry weapons illegally. 'All these people with illegal guns: They're on the subway, walking around the streets, but ordinary, hard-working, law-abiding people, no,' Alito told New York state's solicitor general Barbara Underwood. 'They can't be armed.' The statement from the jurist perturbed gun control advocates, who saw the remark as a sign that Alito and his right-leaning contemporaries on the court were plotting to rescind the law. A recent mass shooting in the city's subway system spawned renewed debate over concealed carry laws in New York state, after a masked shooter struck further fear in New Yorkers after popping a smoke canister on a crowded train in Sunset Park lass month, before opening fire - 33 times - on those inside, injuring 10. Both Second Amendment and gun control advocates have used the incident to strengthen their respective arguments - with those in favor of the law arguing that unarmed citizens on the train car were left defenseless during the attack, while those whom oppose it say the law would not have stopped the suspect, Frank James, from buying the firearm, purchased legally in Ohio, a state with more lax laws. Adams, who has touted efforts to address the city's rampant gun violence and crime-ravaged subway system since being sworn in as mayor earlier this year, said he believes the city will 'carve out' zones where guns will be prohibited - such as schools and subways - if the guidance is upheld by the court. 'This is going to be a legal battle for some time, but the lawyers are looking at it,' he said. 'We're not sleeping on this ruling, on this decision that's coming down.' Meanwhile, the mayor has struggled to address gun violence in the city in the four months he has been in office, with gun violence nearly double what it was in 2019 The city saw its latest shooting on Tuesday, where a gunman killed a 31-year-old man and injured two others at a deli in the Bronx, just a day after Adams was pictured rubbing shoulders with celebrities at the Met Gala while wearing a tuxedo that read 'End Gun Violence' on the back.  Also on Tuesday, another shootout in the Bronx saw an NYPD officer shot by a suspect who had been on the streets awaiting sentencing for a prior gun charge. The officer was the eighth cop to get shot in the city this year.  Gun arrests are up 28 percent, and the NYPD has removed 2,600 illegal guns from the streets this year, Adams said during the presser, touting the numbers. However, major crime is still up 41 percent compared to last year. Adams said he expects to get crime under control by the end of January. 'New Yorkers should be living in a safe city right now, based on the actions of the police department,' the mayor said, before blaming woke city officials for lax laws that see repeat offenders released while awaiting sentencing.  'The problem is we did our job of getting guns off the street. Keeping the shooters off the streets is still failing,' Adams said. 'And so unclog our courts, start to sentence these shooters, modify those parts of the laws that allow shooters to come back onto our streets - those are the pieces that we need that are missing.'", "1645deb777fd4c1e403d41857164fba92481ad5df9bf4faca1925cc8": "The White House on Thursday defended the closure of the Abbott plant that resulted in a shortage of baby formula but officials couldn't say when parents will see more products on the empty grocery store shelves. 'The reason we're here is because the FDA took a step to ensure that babies were taking safe formula. There were babies who died from taking this formula so they were doing their jobs,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at her daily press briefing. President Joe Biden got personally involved on Thursday when he met with executives from infant formula manufactures and retailers including Target, Walmart and Nestle's Gerber to discuss the issue. And his administration announced additional steps it was taking to boost the production of baby formula. But officials were short on specifics. They couldn't say when the Abbott plant would reopen, they couldn't say when more baby formula would be back on shelves and Psaki couldn't offer any options when asked who parents can call for help. The administration did acknowledge the frustration.  'We absolutely recognize the frustration of parents and family,' a senior administration official said on a briefing call with reporters but added: 'I don't have a particular timeline for you' when asked when parents would see some relief.  The officials also didn't know when Abbott Nutrition's Sturgis, Michigan, plant - one of the largest producers of formula - would be back online. 'We do not today have an estimate for accessibility will come on line. But as we just said that the administration is working around the clock to do everything we can to to bring as much production to market,' the official said. Among the steps the administration announced was cutting red tape when it comes to the size of the formula.  'We recognize that this is certainly a challenge for people across the country, something the President is very focused on and we're going to do everything we can to cut red tape and and take steps to increase supply on the marketplace,' Psaki said. Manufacturers typically make multiple sized containers of the product and government programs like WIC often limit what size can be purchased. The administration is working to change those limits to ease the burden on manufactuers and let them rush out one size. Officials also said the administration would work to increase the imports of baby formula but would have more details available on that at a later date.  And the administration is calling on state attorneys general to crack down on price gouging. Formula has been going for up to $120 a can as desperate parents try to feed their children.  Republican Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Marco Rubio of Florida have called on the administration to use the Defense Production Act to get more formula produced. The White House did not rule it out. 'We're gonna keep every option on the table,' the senior administration official said.  Psaki also said it was an option. 'You have to ensure that it would actually achieve what you're trying to achieve,' she said of using it. The shortages have been worsening since February 17 when, after the death of two infants, manufacturer Abbott announced a 'voluntary recall' for formula made at its factory in Michigan -- including Similac, a brand used by millions of American families. A subsequent investigation cleared the formula, but production has yet to resume, exacerbating already ongoing scarcity caused by supply chain problems and labor shortages. Abbott said that pending FDA approval, 'we could restart the site within two weeks.'   Once production began, it would take six weeks to eight weeks for the baby formula to be available on shelves.  Republicans have pounced on the administration for the shortage.   'I think we need to take a moment and think about the fact that, in Joe Biden's America, it seems like it's easier to get a crack pipe and a government-funded smoking kit than it is to find baby formula,' said Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida, a father of a four-month-old. Last week the average out-of-stock rate for baby formula was 43 percent, according to Datasembly, which collected information from more than 11,000 retailers. Elise Stefanik, part of the House Republican leadership and a new mother herself, said she had contacted the US Food and Drug Administration in February but received 'no substantive response.' 'Joe Biden simply has no plan. In fact, when Joe Biden's White House was asked about the shortage, they laughed. Shameful,' she told reporters. Her Republican House colleague Anne Wagner of Missouri said her state was one of six where more than half of the normal supply of baby milk was out of stock. 'I've heard stories of moms firsthand -- my own daughter-in-law -- bartering for baby formula on Facebook,' she said. 'Pregnant women are asking if they should start stockpiling. They're anxious during a time of high stress and anxiety.' Lawmakers on Capitol Hill will hold a hearing in two weeks on infant formula shortages, the House Energy and Commerce Committee said on Wednesday, as it called the situation 'increasingly alarming.' The House of Representatives panel, which is scheduled to meet May 25, did not name any company executives or other witnesses, but said it would release more details before the meeting. The hearing will focus on the shortage's causes, efforts to increase production, and what action is needed 'to ensure access to safe formula across the nation,' the committee chair, Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said in a statement. 'The nationwide infant formula shortages are increasingly alarming and demand Congress' immediate attention,' he said.

The change in scenery on Pennsylvania Avenue comes after the lease sale was finalized earlier Wednesday from the Trump Organization to Hilton's luxury hotel and resort brand. Workers removed the 'TRUMP' lettering from the former president's hotel in Washington D.C. on Wednesday evening as the sale to Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. is finalized. The Trump International Hotel was officially shuttered this week after the Trump Organization reached a $375 million agreement to sell the D.C. property to a Miami-based investor CGI Merchant Group. The deal reached with CGI represents a 25 percent discount from the $500 million the Trump Organization previously sought in 2019 for sale of the property's lease. Hours after the deal officially closed Wednesday, workers descended on the Pennsylvania Avenue location and began taking down signs from the facade of the building. Trump initially boasted that the hotel netted more than $150 million during his presidency, but the Democrat-run House Committee on Oversight and Reform said in October that he actually lost more than $70 million on the hotel during that time - even though the location was a popular spot for lobbyists and right-wing pundits to stay. The Old Post Office and Clock Tower, owned and leased out by the federal government, will now be relaunched as Hilton's luxury brand Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts and attempt to break away the historic building' association with Trump.

'We are incredibly proud of what we accomplished.'  Eric is Trump Organization's executive vice president.  The New Waldorf Astoria Washington, D.C. location is expected to open by early summer. Trump's hotel in the nation's capital has been the center of ethics scrutiny and scandals during his time as president, with lawsuits claiming he used the property for government events to enrich his family's business. In January 2020, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine filed a lawsuit against then-President Trump's inaugural committee and business and claimed it had 'abandoned' its purpose as a nonprofit by overpaying to book event space at Trump International Hotel. The Trump Organization responded at the time with: 'The AG's claims are false, intentionally misleading and riddled with inaccuracies.' 'The rates charged by the hotel were completely in line with what anyone else would have been charged for an unprecedented event of this enormous magnitude and were reflective of the fact that hotel had just recently opened, possessed superior facilities and was centrally located on Pennsylvania Avenue,' the statement added. 'The AG's after the fact attempt to regulate what discounts it believes the hotel should have provided as well as the timing of this complaint reeks of politics and is a clear PR stunt.' The iconic Benjamin Bar also became a popular watering hole for White House and Republican Capitol Hill workers, as well as other Trump allies, during his administration. Over the last few months the hotel had a much less 'open door' policy, with individuals needing reservations to even get through the alleyway to enter the bar and restaurant area.", "e150c7cce455694d624f5cf151749b1ce60f37dbbb331056aa563314": "Two Texas fathers who were arrested for allegedly disrupting Round Rock Independent School District board meetings are now suing, claiming their right to free speech was violated.

Now, in a lawsuit filed months later that was obtained by Fox News Digital, the fathers claim the district violated their rights to petition the government for redress and violated their rights to exercise free speech without retaliation.  'The overall trend is basically a conspiracy among many of them to remove and restrain the civil rights of citizens whom they disagree with,' Jeremy Story, told Fox News Digital on Thursday.  'They ultimately have gone to great lengths to silence parents who disagree with them and ultimately to conceal their own malfeasance.' Story told Fox News Digital he hoped the lawsuit will become 'a landmark case to reverse the loss of parental rights across the country and to give parents a voice back in their kids' education.' 'We want our public education system to simply educate our children and when we send our children to the public school, we are not submitting to be co-parents with the federal government,' he added. The lawsuit comes months after the September 17 arrests of Story and Clark, which calls the disorderly charges 'false' and 'trumped-up,' claiming they 'did not constitute a basis for arrest because they were simply exercising their constitutional right to participate in the board meeting.' In August 2021, Story - a father of seven - attempted to voice his concerns about the allegations against Azaiez, prompting then-Board President Amy Weir to cut him off, warning him not to speak about a topic unrelated to the meeting's agenda. Police then escorted Story out of the meeting. Weir previously told Fox News that 'there has never been an attempt to silence Mr. Story.'  She added that Story wrote on a card indicating what he would say at the meeting, and he wrote that 'unlike the board, citizens are not required to speak on items on the agenda,' thus indicating that 'he was planning to speak on a topic not listed for the meeting,' Weir said.  In September 2021, Clark, a father of four, also mentioned the allegations of misconduct against Azaiez, during a school board meeting that was set up with just 18 chairs in a room that could 300 people and prevented members of the public from entering.  'These actions seemed to be an effort to intimidate parents and control the optics by arbitrarily restricting the capacity of parents and community members allowed in the boardroom,' Clark previously told Fox News Digital. The school board passed a tax increase at that meeting, an increase that the lawsuit claimed was illegal. Clark was removed from the building and school district officials blamed COVID restrictions on the reduced capacity. A few days after the September incident, both Story and Clark were arrested by the sheriff's office on charges of hinder proceeding by disorderly conduct. Story called on the school board to investigate its own members, but the board voted against the investigation.  In the lawsuit filed Wednesday, the fathers claimed the board of trustees 'failed to operate openly, and violated the Texas Open Meetings Act by deliberating in secret and deciding that Azaiez should be hired in a later sham vote.' They also demanded a tempora 0ry restraining order and court injunctions to prevent the defendants from enforcing 'arbitrary spacing rules at board meetings using the Limited Public Comment and pretextual COVID-19 seating rule to limit criticism.'  Jenny LaCoste-Caputo, a spokeswoman for the school district, told Fox News Digital it had not yet been served with the suit and declined comment. The scandal in the Round Rock Independent School District has been brewing for months, and when the school district learned of the allegations against Azaiez, it hired an independent investigator and placed the superintendent on paid administrative leave.  Azaiez had been accused by his mistress of trying to force her to abort their baby and of assaulting her when she refused, prompting the woman to obtain a protective order against him. He returned to work in March after the school board voted 5-2 to bring him back from paid administrative leave.   No criminal charges were filed against Azaiez, and the protective order against him has expired. The mistress, who has not been named, described Azaiez as manipulative, controlling and 'very rough' in their intimacy. She claimed that Azaiez, who was married, told her he was estranged from his wife and was only waiting for his children to grow up to file for a divorce. The superintendent's lover wrote in her affidavit that she told Azaiez about her pregnancy on June 24, 2021, after he had just signed the contract naming him Round Rock's new superintendent. According to the filing, Azaiez blamed the woman for their affair and pregnancy, and then allegedly started to threaten her on phone calls and in text messages. 'He asked me to have an abortion so he would not lose his career and family. I was very upset at this, and I said no to an abortion and told him that I had made up my mind to have the child,' the woman, who was nine weeks pregnant at the time, wrote. 'He said this child was a mistake and so was I, he wanted nothing to do with this child, he did not want it,' she continued. 'He said I was lying, and he was not the father of the child.' A few days later, she wrote that Azaiez started to intimidate her 'by telling me he was in a position of power...he then said no one would believe me if I said he was the father and that he would tell everyone I was crazy and make me look crazy'. The mistress said she repeatedly implored Azaiez to inform the school board of her pregnancy, but she claimed the newly hired superintendent bragged to her that then-School Board President Amy Weir 'had offered to protect him, she was informing him of everything and guaranteed him he would not lose his job,' according to the court document. The petitioner continued: 'In the past I had heard conversations between him and the school board preside plotting things and keeping things from other school board members.' The filing alleged that on July 6, Azaiez called his mistress, accusing her of informing the school board of her pregnancy behind his back. He allegedly reiterated that Weir would protect him and the woman 'was going to pay for him losing his career and family'. Later that same day, Azaiez allegedly came to his pregnant girlfriend' home and again tried to convince her to get an abortion, but she refused. 'He became so angry he grabbed my arms with force, shaking me and shoving me until he threw me to the floor,' she claimed. When the woman threatened to call the police, she said Azaiez took away her phone, but then told her he did not mean to do this and left. The woman claimed that after the attack, she developed a bleeding and was told by her doctor that she could miscarry. It's unclear whether the woman brought the pregnancy to term. According to the protective order application, the mistress was left fearing for her life and her baby's life after someone broke into her home in the Austin area in mid-July and stole items containing her personal information, including her iPad, laptop, and journals, but not her jewelry, cash or other valuables. His attorney told Fox News Digital that she has 'incontrovertible' evidence proving that the assault never happened, but she did not say what it is. She also revealed that Azaiez and his mistress have 'amicably' reached a confidential settlement agreement.", "922f8cfee67edca3ff2fa8da01a56e7ea83561889adeaffa088731e1": "The family of the hero passenger who landed a plane in Florida with no experience after the pilot became incoherent say they're proud and impressed of the interior designer. Darren Harrison, 39, has been identified as the passenger who took over a Cessna 208 Caravan traveling from Leonard M. Thompson International Airport in Marsh Harbor, the Bahamas on Tuesday and safely landed the plane at at the Palm Beach International Airport in Florida after the pilot suffered a medical emergency and fell unconscious.   Harrison currently works as a lead commercial and residential flooring specialist at Sunshine Interiors, a family-owned interior design company based in Florida.  The 39-year-old has spent 16 years in the flooring industry after being introduced to the business by his father and now works on commercial projects throughout the state of Florida, according to his employers.  Matthew Harrison, 37, told the New York Post that his older cousin Darren, who serves as vice president at Sunshine Interiors, was returning from a fishing trip in the Bahamas to his pregnant wife.   Matthew said he could not believe his own relative was behind the miraculous landing.  'I was like, 'Wait, that's my cousin?' Matthew told the Post.  Matthew said he did not know his cousin could be so calm under immense pressure.   'That was insane. I'm impressed too, he was so calm, I've never known him to be that calm before,' he said.  But Darren's uncle, Glenn Harrison, said he knew his nephew to be able to keep his cool.  'I know he was probably scared to death but it doesn't surprise me him doing what he did,' Glenn told The Post. 'He's pretty good about keeping his cool, it doesn't surprise me he kept his composure, followed directions and everything turned out great.'  Matthew said he texted Darren's wife to let her know how proud of his cousin he was.  'I messaged his wife and said, ''Will you reach out to him and let him know I'm super impressed and proud of him, that's amazing,'' Matthew told the Post.  'She said, ''I know that's not like a phone call you expect to get...''and when he told her what happened she said, ''You did what?'' Matthew said, laughing.  Harrison quickly sprang into action after his pilot became incapacitated. He was aided by Robert Morgan, an air traffic controller, who printed out a picture of the cockpit controls to to guide the passenger through the steps of flying and landing the plane as he struggled with the navigation system.  'I just feel like it was probably meant to happen,' Morgan told WBPF. 'I knew the plane was flying like any other plane. I just had to keep him calm, point him to the runway and tell him how to reduce the power so he could descend to land. 'Before I knew it, he was like, ''I'm on the ground. How do I turn this thing off?'' Once he landed, Morgan said, he ran out to meet Harrison and the two hugged on the tarmac. 'It felt really good to help somebody, and he told me that he was going to go home tonight to see his pregnant wife.' Air traffic control recordings have revealed just how tense the situation was as Harrison, who had no flying experience, tried to safely landed the Cessna light aircraft - a feat that one JetBlue pilot said was 'nothing short of a miracle.' In the audio, obtained by DailyMail.com, Harrison could be heard telling air traffic control in Fort Pierce, while flying over the Florida coastline around 70 miles north of his destination. 'My pilot has gone incoherent. I have no idea how to fly the airplane.'   An air traffic control agent then replied: 'Roger. What's your position?' Harrison replied: 'I have no idea. I can see the coast of Florida in front of me. And I have no idea.' The audibly shocked air traffic controller in Fort Pierce then told Harrison that he would try and locate the plane when the emergency call came through over his radio. 'Maintain wings level and just try to follow the coast, either north or southbound,' the controller said. 'We're trying to locate you.' For the next four minutes, audio showed that Harrison remained remarkably calm as he tried to work out what to do and wait for the air traffic controller to find his aircraft.  'Have you guys located me yet?' he asked after a while. 'I can't even get my nav screen to turn on. It has all the information on it. You guys have any ideas on that?'   Harrison was eventually found flying off the coast of Boca Raton, and Morgan, at the Palm Beach airport, eventually managed to talk him down as he guided him on how to land the plane. air traffic control at Palm Beach airport managed to talk him down, guiding him how to land the plane.  The landing was a little wobbly, but ultimately safe and successful according to air traffic control, who were clearly astounded at the 39-year-old's ability to settle the plane on the runway with no prior experience whatsoever. 'You just witnessed a couple passengers land that plane,' the dumbfounded air traffic controller said over the radio. Another pilot on the runway said: 'Did you say the passengers landed the plane?' 'That's correct,' control responded. 'Oh, my gosh. Great job!' The pilot, who remained unconscious was later taken to the hospital as a result of the unknown illness. His condition remains unknown. An aviation expert told CNN it is not uncommon for small turboprop airplanes such as the Cessna 208 Caravan to fly with only one pilot, particularly when the flights are private.  An FAA spokesperson confirmed they were investigating the incident and said the pilot suffered a 'possible medical issue' - though did not provide further details on his condition.  Justin Dalmolin, a JetBlue pilot, was told to delay his takeoff to give the unnamed Cessna passenger space and time to land the plane. 'The level of difficulty that this person had to deal with in terms of having zero flight time to fly and land a single engine turbine aircraft is absolutely incredible,' said an amazed Dalmolin. He told ABC 25: 'The incredible part is not just flying the aircraft but obviously the most difficult thing which is configuring the aircraft for approach and landing. And then landing it, and that to me, for a zero time pilot. 'I remember my first days when I first started flight training, I was white-knuckled and sweating for my first ten hours of training.' Dalmolin said it was lucky it was daylight so that Harrison could see where he was going because it would have been extremely difficult if it the saga had unfolded overnight or in heavy fog. 'You know it's nothing short of a miracle and I'm really glad for them and their families they had such a great outcome,' said Dalmolin. John Nance, an aviation expert, also told ABC 25 that the landing of such a complex plane by someone without any flying history was a remarkable feat. 'This is the first time I've ever heard of one of these being landed by somebody that has no aeronautical experience,' Nance said. 'The person on the airplane who had no aeronautical experience listened very carefully and obviously followed instructions with great calm. 'That's what made the difference.'

Milana Li, 13, had not been seen since 4pm Sunday when she was spotted around her family's apartment near Murray Boulevard and Scholls Ferry Road but was only reported missing at 1pm the following day. The teenager's mother told police the schoolgirl was a 'runaway' and was possibly wearing 'plaid pajamas with white writing on the side and a dark hooded sweatshirt' when she vanished.  Her body was found in the Westside Linear Park, near the intersection of Barrows Road and Horizon Boulevard at about 3pm Tuesday after cops were called to the area on a report of 'suspicious circumstances,' the Beaverton Police Department said in a statement.  The Conestoga Middle School sixth-grader's body was taken to the autopsy lab, where her death was ultimately ruled a homicide but it is unclear how she died.  'The circumstances surrounding Li's death are suspicious. This is an ongoing investigation,' the Beaverton Police Department wrote in a statement.  Police said they 'do not believe there is a continued threat to our community'.  A makeshift memorial has been set up in the park near the stream where Li's body was found.  Multiple candles, baby dolls, stuffed animals, and flowers have been laid on the sidewalk and a rainbow balloon waves in the wind as cars drive.  Savanna Tinline, a classmate of Li's, planted lavender near the stream with her mother in honor of the girl.  'Looking at the memorial, the flowers on the hard concrete, Savanna's mother Krista told KOIN 6. 'I wanted something more permanent and she said: 'Mom, can we go down there? She really liked purple flowers.''  'We wanted something that will just stay there for her,' Savanna said.  Malikai Johnson, eight, and his mother Kortnie also visited the memorial and dropped off a small Beanie Baby to honor Li.  'We have a couple friends that were her friends that were like really, really depressed and were very sad, so that's why we came, and we did this for them,' Malikai told KATU 2.  Kortnie said she would be keeping a close eye on her son as a result of the homicide, despite normally feeling safe in the area, KATU 2 reported.  'Like the other day he said: 'I'm gonna scooter down to some friends' houses,' and as a mom, you hesitate and you're like: 'Well, how far? I'm gonna follow you just to make sure.' And now this happened, and I'm like: 'Well, now I'm gonna bike ride with you because I'm not comfortable 100% yet,'' Kortnie said.  Mary Stanley, a grandmother who walks the trial regularly with her granddaughter, told KATU 2: 'We walk this trail, we love this trail, it's just a good way to get exercise, get fresh air, meet people.  'It broke my heart, honestly, both her and I this morning. When we heard, we just wanted to cry because, like I said, if it were my daughter, I don't even know how I would react.'  Stanley revealed she and her granddaughter had prayed the night before for Li's safe return and said seeing the memorial was 'very hard.'  Beaverton Police Department reported they had 'several tips' from the community and are actively investigating.  DailyMail.com has attempted to contact the Beaverton PD for comment.

The singer, 76, shot herself at her Tennessee farm on April 30 - a day before being inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame - after battling her mental health, Ashley told Good Morning America on Thursday. Ashley, 54, choked back tears as she drip-fed more details about the iconic singer's suicide last month in her first television interview on the tragedy. Ashley and her sister Wynonna, 57 - who performed with Naomi for years in The Judds - first open up about her death at the Country Music Hall of Fame ceremony on May 1. Meanwhile Naomi's husband Larry Strickland, 76, has remained tight-lipped, releasing a short statement saying he was going through a 'heartbreaking time'. Ashley told GMA: 'I appreciate so deeply and really want to start by thanking everyone for their outpouring of love and condolences and that my sister and I, we have a depth of gratitude. 'I'm here as an individual sitting with you by myself, but both my sister and Pop have sort of deputized me in certain ways to speak on behalf of the family at this early time - before things about the 30th of April become public without our control. 'You know, whether it's the autopsy or the exact manner of her death, and so that's really the impetus for this timing, otherwise it's obviously way too soon and so that's important for us to say up front. 'I think that I would start with my mother knew that she was seen and she was heard in her anguish and that she was walked home. 'When we're talking about mental illness, it's very important to be clear and make the distinction between our loved one and the disease. It's very real, and it is enough to - it lies. It's savage and, you know, my mother - our mother - couldn't hang on until she was inducted into the Hall of Fame by her peers. 'That is the level of catastrophe of what was going on inside of her, because the barrier between the regard in which they held her couldn't penetrate into her heart and the lie the disease told her was so convincing. '[The lie] that you're not enough, that you're not loved. That you're not worthy and I mean her brain hurt. It physically hurt. 'And I'm tasked with an exceedingly difficult task in disclosing the manner of the way my mother chose not to continue to live. And I've thought about this so much because once I say it, it cannot be unsaid and so - because we don't want it to be a part of the gossip economy - I will share with you that she used a weapon. 'Mother used a firearm so that's the piece of information that we are very uncomfortable sharing, but understand we're in a position that, you know, if we don't say it, someone else is going to.' Ashley, who was visiting Naomi's Tennessee home on the day she died, also detailed her last moments with her mother.   'It was a mixed day,' Ashley told GMA. 'I visit with my mom and Pop every day when I'm home in Tennessee. So, I was at the house visiting as I am every day, and mom said to me: 'Will you stay with me?' 'I said, 'of course, I will.' The actress had stepped outside to greet a family friend and when she went to notify her mother that their guest had arrived, she found her dead.  'I went upstairs to let her know that the friend was there and I discovered her. I have both grief and trauma from discovering her. 'My mother is entitled to her dignity and her privacy and so there are some things that we would just like to retain as a family.  'I want to be very careful when we talk about this today that for anyone having those ideas or those impulses, you know, to talk to someone, to share, to be open to be vulnerable. There is a national suicide hotline.  Ashley also shared what it's like to love someone struggling with mental illness. 'I really accepted the love my mother was capable of giving me because I knew she was fragile, so when I walked around the back of their house and came in the kitchen door and she said 'there's my darling, there's my baby and she lit up,' I savored those moments,' she said. 'And every time we hugged and she drank me in, I was very present for those tactile experiences because I knew there would come a time when she would be gone, whether it was sooner or whether it was later, whether it was by the disease or another cause. 'Mom was a brilliant conversationalist. She was a star. She was an underrated songwriter, and she was someone who suffered from mental illness, you know, and had a lot of trouble getting off the sofa except to go into town every day to The Cheesecake Factory where all the staff knew and loved her. 'And I know everything about them because she told me everything about them. Duane at Walgreens who needs to get a dog - that's the way she was. 'She always had $100 bills stuffed in her bra, passing them out to the janitorial staff. An unfailingly kind, sensitive woman. 'She was very isolated in many ways because of the disease and yet there were a lot of people who showed up for her over the years, not just me.' Ashley also shred a letter from her sister, Wynonna, addressing her mother's passing. 'This is from sister and we talked a lot about doing this together and what she shared is just so her,' Ashley said before reading aloud: 'Thinking a lot about you today. I love you four exclamation points. I've been looking at photos of us when we were little, laugh out loud, good lord in capitals, you were such a cutie pie. 'I laugh and I cry and I thank god we have each other. I need to take some time to process and I need this time to myself. I'm not ready yet to speak publicly about what happened, so I know you understand why I'm not there today. 'We will do this piece differently. We have each other and I'm grateful we're connected as we walk together through this storm. I just can't - I just can't believe she's gone. 'I'm here. This will take time. I love you, dear sister, I'm proud of you and I'm here whenever you need me,' Wynonna's letter concluded.  Naomi had written extensively about her struggles with depression, and even referenced suicide in an open letter published in People magazine in 2018. 'For everyone mourning the death of someone who committed suicide, an inevitable question arises: Why did this happen? Unfortunately, we don't have very good answers,' she wrote. 'We do know that suicidal behavior accompanies many behavioral brain disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Suicide is actually one of the leading causes of preventable death among these mental illnesses.'  In her 2018 essay, Naomi Judd advocated for more research into the nature of suicide.   'To understand this issue better, we have to bring the study of suicide into mainstream neuroscience and treat the condition like every other brain disorder,' she wrote.  'People who commit suicide are experiencing problems with mood, impulse control and aggression, all of which involve discrete circuits in the brain that regulate these aspects of human experience, but we still don't understand how these circuits go haywire in the brains of suicide victims.' She described what depression feels like to her in an interview with People magazine while promoting her 2016 book. 'Nobody can understand it unless you've been there,' she said. 'Think of your very worst day of your whole life - someone passed away, you lost your job, you found out you were being betrayed, that your child had a rare disease - you can take all of those at once and put them together and that's what depression feels like.' Naomi took her own life the day before she and Wynonna were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. The Judds scored 14 No. 1 songs in a career that spanned nearly three decades. In addition to The Judds, Eddie Bayers, who played on many of the duo's records, Ray Charles and Pete Drake were also inducted into the Hall of Fame on May 1.  Ashley and Wynonna broke down in tears during the induction ceremony. 'My mama loved you so much,' Ashley said to the crowd gathered. 'And I'm sorry that she couldn't hang on until today,' she said through tears. 'I didn't prepare anything tonight because I knew Mom would probably talk the most,' Wynonna told the audience in Nashville. 'I'm gonna make this fast, because my heart's broken, and I feel so blessed. It's a very strange dynamic, to be this broken and this blessed.... Though my heart's broken, I will continue to sing, because that's what we do.' The pair cited a bible verse and lamented that Naomi hadn't lived to receive the honor herself. 'Your esteem for her and your regard for her really penetrated her heart and it was your affection for her that did keep her going in the last years and please come see Pop,' Ashley said, referencing her father and Naomi's husband, Larry Strickland. Ashley also paid tribute to sister Wynonna, who was also inducted alongside her mother as part of the country music duo The Judds. 'While this is so much about The Judds as a duo, I want to take a moment to recognize my sister, a GOAT,' she said, meaning 'Greatest of All Time.'  Wynonna Judd talked about the family gathering as they said goodbye to her and she and Ashley Judd recited Psalm 23. 'Though my heart is broken I will continue to sing,' she said. The daughters kept their sense of humor amid the sadness, as Wynonna said: 'I didn't prepare much to say, because I assumed mama would be doing all the talking.'  'Newspapers don't get a lot right these days but when they said you were Elvis-like, they got it.'  The next day Ashley posted a heartbreaking Instagram message declaring herself 'Speechless' and telling Naomi: 'Be free, my beautiful mother. Be free.'  The mother-daughter performers scored 14 No. 1 songs in a career that spanned nearly three decades. After rising to the top of country music, the duo called it quits in 1991 after doctors diagnosed Naomi with hepatitis. The Judds' hits included Love Can Build a Bridge in 1990, Mama He's Crazy in 1984, Why Not Me in 1984, Turn It Loose in 1988, Girls Night Out in 1985, Rockin' With the Rhythm of the Rain in 1986 and Grandpa in 1986. The pair last performed together at the CMT Music Awards of April 11, singing Love Can Build a Bridge. They were accompanied by a gospel choir.  The Judds had also recently announced a farewell tour, the first by Naomi and Wynonna in more than a decade.  The short, 10-date tour, which was being produced by Sandbox Live and Live Nation, was to start on September 30 in Grand Rapids, Michigan and wrap up October 28 at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena.  They first got attention singing on Ralph Emery's morning show in early 1980, where the host named them the 'Soap Sisters' because Naomi said she used to make her own soap. After the success of 'Mama He's Crazy,' they won the Horizon Award at the 1984 CMA Awards. Naomi started her speech by saying, 'Slap the dog and spit in the fire!' Daughter Ashley Judd is an actress known for her roles in such movies as 'Kiss the Girls,' 'Double Jeopardy' and 'Heat.' Larry Strickland, who was a backup singer for Elvis Presley, was married to Naomi Judd for 32 years.

'I appreciate so deeply and really want to start by thanking everyone for their outpouring of love and condolences and that my sister and I, we have a depth of gratitude,' Ashley Judd told GMA. 'I'm here as an individual sitting with you by myself, but both my sister and Pop have sort of deputized me in certain ways to speak on behalf of the family at this early time - before things about the 30th of April become public without our control. 'You know, whether it's the autopsy or the exact manner of her death, and so that's really the impetus for this timing, otherwise it's obviously way too soon and so that's important for us to say up front. 'I think that I would start with my mother knew that she was seen and she was heard in her anguish and that she was walked home. 'When we're talking about mental illness, it's very important to be clear and make the distinction between our loved one and the disease. It's very real, and it is enough to - it lies. It's savage and, you know, my mother - our mother - couldn't hang on until she was inducted into the Hall of Fame by her peers. 'That is the level of catastrophe of what was going on inside of her, because the barrier between the regard in which they held her couldn't penetrate into her heart and the lie the disease told her was so convincing. '[The lie] that you're not enough, that you're not loved. That you're not worthy and I mean her brain hurt. It physically hurt. 'And I'm tasked with an exceedingly difficult task in disclosing the manner of the way my mother chose not to continue to live. And I've thought about this so much because once I say it, it cannot be unsaid and so - because we don't want it to be a part of the gossip economy - I will share with you that she used a weapon. 'Mother used a firearm so that's the piece of information that we are very uncomfortable sharing, but understand we're in a position that, you know, if we don't say it, someone else is going to. 'It was a mixed day. I visit with my mom and Pop every day when I'm home in Tennessee. So, I was at the house visiting as I am every day, and mom said to me: 'Will you stay with me?' 'I said, 'of course, I will.' The actress had stepped outside to greet a family friend and when she went to notify her mother that their guest had arrived, she found her dead.  'I went upstairs to let her know that the friend was there and I discovered her. I have both grief and trauma from discovering her. 'My mother is entitled to her dignity and her privacy and so there are some things that we would just like to retain as a family.  'I want to be very careful when we talk about this today that for anyone having those ideas or those impulses, you know, to talk to someone, to share, to be open to be vulnerable. There is a national suicide hotline. 'I really accepted the love my mother was capable of giving me because I knew she was fragile, so when I walked around the back of their house and came in the kitchen door and she said 'there's my darling, there's my baby and she lit up,' I savored those moments. 'And every time we hugged and she drank me in, I was very present for those tactile experiences because I knew there would come a time when she would be gone, whether it was sooner or whether it was later, whether it was by the disease or another cause. 'Mom was a brilliant conversationalist. She was a star. She was an underrated songwriter, and she was someone who suffered from mental illness, you know, and had a lot of trouble getting off the sofa except to go into town every day to The Cheesecake Factory where all the staff knew and loved her. 'And I know everything about them because she told me everything about them. Duane at Walgreens who needs to get a dog - that's the way she was. 'She always had $100 bills stuffed in her bra, passing them out to the janitorial staff. An unfailingly kind, sensitive woman. 'She was very isolated in many ways because of the disease and yet there were a lot of people who showed up for her over the years, not just me.' Ashley also shred a letter from her sister, Wynonna, addressing her mother's passing. 'This is from sister and we talked a lot about doing this together and what she shared is just so her,' Ashley said before reading aloud: 'Thinking a lot about you today. I love you four exclamation points. I've been looking at photos of us when we were little, laugh out loud, good lord in capitals, you were such a cutie pie. 'I laugh and I cry and I thank god we have each other. I need to take some time to process and I need this time to myself. I'm not ready yet to speak publicly about what happened, so I know you understand why I'm not there today. 'We will do this piece differently. We have each other and I'm grateful we're connected as we walk together through this storm. I just can't - I just can't believe she's gone. 'I'm here. This will take time. I love you, dear sister, I'm proud of you and I'm here whenever you need me,' Wynonna's letter concluded.   Naomi Judd spoke about falling into an 'dark, absolutely terrifying hole', said she considered suicide and underwent electroshock therapy to treat depression before her death at age 76: Daughters say they lost their 'beautiful mother to mental illness'  Naomi Judd, who died at the age of 76 on April 30, had battled with her mental illness for many years and previously admitted to undergoing electro-shock therapy and having considered suicide in recent years. She told the Today Show in 2017 that after The Judds stopped touring, she didn't get off the couch for two years, falling into  'extreme' and 'severe' depression. '[Fans] see me in rhinestones, you know, with glitter in my hair, that really is who I am,' she said. 'But then I would come home and not leave the house for three weeks, and not get out of my pyjamas, and not practice normal hygiene. It was really bad. 'When I came off the tour I went into this deep, dark absolutely terrifying hole and I couldn't get out,' she added. 'I spent two years on my couch.' She said she even scouted out a bridge near her family's farm to jump from.  'That's how bad it can get,' she said. 'It's hard to describe. You go down in this deep, dark hole of depression and you don't think that there's another minute.' She said that one night, her husband and daughter Ashley called 911 and she entered therapy, eventually undergoing ECT (electroshock therapy) to 'jump start' the chemicals in her brain.  Naomi had spoken publicly and written books over the years about her struggles with mental health issues. Her daughters announced her death the day before The Judds were set to be formally inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame at a medallion ceremony in Nashville.  'We are shattered. We are navigating profound grief and know that as we loved her, she was loved by her public. We are in unknown territory,' Ashley and Wynonna's statement read. The mother-daughter performers scored 14 No. 1 songs in a career that spanned nearly three decades.  After rising to the top of country music, they called it quits in 1991 after doctors diagnosed Naomi with hepatitis. The Judds' hits included Love Can Build a Bridge in 1990, Mama He's Crazy in 1984, Why Not Me in 1984, Turn It Loose in 1988, Girls Night Out in 1985, Rockin' With the Rhythm of the Rain in 1986 and Grandpa in 1986. The Judds had also recently announced a farewell tour, the first by Naomi and Wynonna in more than a decade.  The short, 10-date tour, which was being produced by Sandbox Live and Live Nation, was to start on September 30 in Grand Rapids, Michigan and wrap up October 28 at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena.  'What I'm looking forward to most is celebrating Judd music with the fans,' said Wynonna in a statement when the tour was announced. 'Mom and I have had quite the journey over the last 38 years, and the fans have been with us through it all. This tour is a celebration for them.' The Judds sang on the CMT Music Awards telecast and walked the red carpet just this month. The show aired live on CBS April 11. 'Honored to have witnessed 'Love Can Build a Bridge' just a few short weeks ago,' singer Maren Morris posted on Twitter on Saturday.  Born Diana Ellen Judd in Ashland, Kentucky, Naomi was working as a nurse in Nashville, when she and Wynonna started singing together professionally.  Their unique harmonies, together with elements of acoustic music, bluegrass and blues, made them stand out in the genre at the time. 'We had a such a stamp of originality on what we were trying to do,' Naomi Judd told The AP after it was announced that they would be joining the Country Music Hall of Fame. The Judds released six studio albums and an EP between 1984 and 1991 and won nine Country Music Association Awards and seven from the Academy of Country Music. They earned a total of five Grammy Awards together on hits like 'Why Not Me' and 'Give A Little Love.' The Judds sang about family, the belief in marriage and the virtue of fidelity. Because Naomi was so young looking, the two were mistaken for sisters early in their career. The Judds first got attention singing on Ralph Emery's morning show in early 1980, where the host named them the 'Soap Sisters' because Naomi said she used to make her own soap. After the success of 'Mama He's Crazy,' they won the Horizon Award at the 1984 CMA Awards. Naomi started her speech by saying 'Slap the dog and spit in the fire!' Daughter Ashley Judd is an actor known for her roles in such movies as 'Kiss the Girls,' 'Double Jeopardy' and 'Heat.' Larry Strickland, who was a backup singer for Elvis Presley, was married to Naomi Judd for 32 years. Naomi faced hard times and battled depression, as she admitted in one of her several books.  She claimed to have put herself through nursing school to support her daughters before pursuing her Nashville dreams with Wynonna, becoming the Judds. In her book 'River of Time: My Descent into Depression and How I Emerged with Hope' she writes about struggles a single mother and a survivor of domestic abuse and sexual assault.   At the height of their popularity, Naomi lived through the previously incurable Hepatitis C virus, having been pronounced cured five years after the diagnosis.   After finishing the last Judds tour in 2011, she battled depression and anxiety through treatment. She called River of Time 'her poignant message of hope to anyone whose life has been scarred by trauma.'", "87e1f92a9c69b7338414b30b549d5c54f04a44fd54386ed2d2326bd7": "A woman with a peanut allergy has died after suffering a fatal anaphylactic shock in West London. Tania Kaur Khasriya, 24,  dined at a restaurant in Southall in July 2018 where she accidentally ate a peanut. She never regained consciousness and  passed away four years later. The student from Ealing was diagnosed with the deadly nut allergy when she was just a year old, in 1998. Opening her inquest today, Coroner Lydia Brown said: 'She had an anaphylactic shock to eating a peanut in a restaurant in July 2018 and has since suffered a disorder of consciousness.' She was rushed to Ealing Hospital for treatment, but was relocated to a nursing centre after her condition failed to improve.  Ms Khasriya never regained consciousness from the reaction and passed away on April 27 this year after doctors withdrew palliative care.  Her death was put down to three causes - persistent disorder of consciousness, hypoxic brain injury and anaphylaxis due to peanut allergy. The Coroner called it a 'complex inquiry' and adjourned the inquest to a later date.  Coroner Ms Brown said 'the restaurant, unnamed as of yet' during the inquest. The hearing will look at reports from the palliative care consultant at the care home, as well as information from the London Ambulance Service. Ms Khasriya spent her last years at Chalfont Lodge nursing centre in Buckinghamshire, which is purpose built to help people with neurological conditions, physical disabilities and dementia.  Peanuts are a common food allergy, with around 2% of children affected in the UK.  It is the most common cause of food-related deaths and is due to a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction of the immune system in those who have it. Charity website Anaphylaxis Campaign said that hospital admissions for food allergies have increased by 500 per cent since 1990. Up to 20 per cent of patients struggle daily with the fear of a possible asthma attack or anaphylactic shock.", "f1cb249e54468ce16b405e9426ac93dae97e60f54e140c3ab2c03bd4": "A top police union boss has blasted the decision to dramatically-shorten the sentences for two lawyers who admitted firebombing an empty NYPD van during the 2020 BLM riots. Patrick J. Lynch, President of the New York City Police Benevolent Association, hit out as it was revealed Colinford Mattis, 35, and Urooj Rahman, 33, now face just two years in jail. The pair had originally faced up to life behind bars after torching the van in Brooklyn in May 2020, days after George Floyd's murder at the hands of Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin. But the disgraced former lawyers had their terrorism charges reduced to conspiracy to commit arson thanks to a plea deal, according to a letter filed Tuesday. Prosecutors have said they'll ask for the pair to be given between 18 and 24 months behind bars, although the sentencing judge has the discretion to impose a sentence of up to five years.  During a hearing at Brooklyn Federal Court in October 2021, the pair were still facing 10 years behind bars - but are now set to score a much lighter sentence.  Lynch told Fox News: 'The judge must reject this request. There is absolutely no justification for lowballing the sentence for an anti-police terrorist attack.'   'It's bad enough that these dangerous criminals have been allowed to sit at home for the past two years,' Lynch said.  'Handing them a below-guidelines sentence would give a green light to other anti-police radicals who seek to advance their cause through violence. The judge must reject this request.'  Initially, Mattis - a corporate attorney -  and human rights lawyer Rahman were looking at a 40-year mandatory minimum count and life imprisonment, when they were arrested on May 30 2020.  Despite the wanton destructiveness of their crimes, the firebug pair have spent most of the last two years in home confinement.  The government's previous plan was a 10-year sentence with terrorism enhancement, based on an October 2021 Brooklyn federal court hearing which involved Mattis and Rahman each pleaded guilty to one count of possessing and making a destructive device.   Tuesday's letter asked that the U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan to convert a May 18 hearing scheduled for debate over the terrorism enhancement to a change of plea hearing, prosecutors said. They the defendants' lack of prior criminal history, plan to replace the original indictment, Law.com reported.  An initial complaint alleges that surveillance footage shown captured Rahman tossing a Molotov cocktail at an unoccupied NYPD vehicle parked near the 88th Precinct in Brooklyn, New York, and then fleeing in a tan minivan. Mattis was the alleged getaway driver. Cops chased the pair and are said to have noticed the equipment used to build the petrol bombs while placing them under arrest. That included a lighter, a bottle filled with toilet paper, a liquid believed to be gasoline, and a tank filled with gasoline.

The Swift Response 22 exercises in North Macedonia involve 4,500 troops from the US, Britain, France, Italy and other allied nations and are taking place against the backdrop of Russian aggression against perceived Western expansion. There are similar military drills being held across five locations in Europe this month, to show Finland what they will soon be joining.  Swift Response involves parachute drops, helicopter-borne air assaults and sees French paratroopers and an Italian working to a British chain of command.  Exercise Hedgehog is also taking place on the Estonia-Latvia border this month featuring 18,000 NATO troops in the biggest military exercise in Estonia which takes place every four years.  Today, Finland announced it intends to start the formal application process to join the military pact, more than doubling NATO's presence on Russia's borders from 754 miles to 1,584 miles. The decision is a spectacular backfire for Putin who invaded Ukraine in part through fears of Volodymyr Zelensky joining the US-led alliance. Over the past 10 days, soldiers from Albania, France, Greece, Italy, North Macedonia, Montenegro, the UK and the US have taken part in the exercises in North Macedonia, which have included parachute jumps at several locations around the country. North Macedonia formally joined NATO in March 2020. The small Balkan country of 1.8million people has an active military of about 8,000 personnel. 'I think it's a fantastic demonstration of what we can do as an alliance and our ability to project combat power if asked to do so and how quickly we can do it,' Maj. Gen. Peter B. Andrysiak, U.S. Army Deputy Commanding General for Europe and Africa, told reporters after an hourlong display in North Macedonia. The purpose of the exercises is to showcase the ability for large ground combat operations for member states and allies. Earlier, Russian state TV accused the US of erecting a 'new iron curtain' in Europe in a furious response to Finland announcing its intention to join NATO. This morning, president Sauli Niinisto and prime minister Sanna Marin said they want to join the security alliance 'without delay', with Sweden set to follow suit within days, drastically ramping up tensions between Russia and the West.  The Kremlin had previously threatened it would secure 'the entire destruction' of the country and 'the most undesirable consequences', and today said it would 'be forced to take retaliatory steps', both 'military-technical and other'. A Number 10 spokesman said the UK is 'fully committed to NATO's open door policy' and said the only threatening behaviour in Europe has been Russia's invasion.  When asked what he would say to Russia, Niinisto replied: 'You caused this. Look in the mirror.'  After the announcement, Russian state TV's Olga Skabeyeva said: 'The main beneficiary here is America and Biden. And the main aim is a new iron curtain from the Barents to the Black Sea.' Meanwhile Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the move was 'definitely' a threat to Russia and warned it would make Europe more unstable.  He said Finland had made 'unfriendly steps' against Russia and it was a cause for regret and a reason to impose a symmetrical response.  Asked whether this presented a threat to Russia, Peskov said: 'Definitely. NATO expansion does not make our continent more stable and secure.' Sweden is expected to follow Finland with its own bid which could come as soon as next week, with a parliament debate on Monday followed by a special cabinet meeting where the formal decision to apply will be taken, Daily Expressen said. A special committee will announce Finland's decision on a membership bid on Sunday although it could take until October before the country is formally admitted to the pact. The major policy shift which completely rewrites Europe's post WWII alignment comes a day after Boris Johnson signed security pacts with Helsinki and Stockholm pledging Britain would come to their aid if they come under Russian attack.  In their statement today, Niinisto and Marin said: 'Now that the moment of decision-making is near, we state our equal views, also for information to the parliamentary groups and parties.  'NATO membership would strengthen Finland's security. As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance. 'Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay. 'We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.' Finland, which shares an 830-mile border and a difficult past with Russia, has previously remained outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to maintain friendly relations with its eastern neighbour. Earlier this morning, former prime minister Alexander Stubb said: 'I have been waiting for this day for 30 years. 'Announcement on Finnish NATO membership imminent.' Sweden is expected to imminently follow Finland with an application to join the Western military pact. The Nordic nations have been rattled by Moscow's war against its pro-Western neighbour, which has bolstered domestic support for joining the alliance - and the security that membership would provide. After today's announcement, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the eventual membership process would be 'smooth and swift'. 'This is a sovereign decision by Finland, which NATO fully respects. Should Finland decide to apply, they would be warmly welcomed into NATO,' Stoltenberg said. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also said he will push for a quick admission process. 'Denmark will of course warmly welcome Finland to NATO. (It) will strengthen NATO and our common security,' Frederiksen said on Twitter. 'Denmark will do everything for a quick admission process after the formal application.' Meanwhile Volodymyr Zelensky 'commended' Finland's readiness to apply to join the NATO alliance in a phone call with Niinisto. 'We also discussed Ukraine's European integration. And - defence interaction,' he wrote on Twitter. Both Finland and Sweden have been militarily non-aligned since WWII. Sweden maintained its policy of neutrality - which had begun in the early 19th century - throughout the war wanting to avoid being drawn into a conflict that was engulfing the nearby powers of Germany and the Soviet Union. Instead, Sweden profited from its neutrality by exporting iron ore to the Nazis and sharing military intelligence with the Allies and training their refugee soldiers.  Meanwhile Finland changed sides in the conflict, first being invaded by Joseph Stalin and assisting the Nazis, before fighting against Hitler's troops. When NATO was formed in 1949 for a Western military alliance, Sweden decided not to join and continue its neutrality, introducing a security policy that secured its non-alignment in peace and neutrality in war.  In 1994, Stockholm decided to join the NATO programme Partnership for Peace (PfP), aimed to build trust between member states and other European countries, but until now it has not signalled a desire to fully join the alliance. Finland is also a PfP member but has similarly stated its desire to remain neutral since the war. The EU member state was part of the Russian Empire and won independence during the 1917 Russian revolution but it nearly lost it fighting the Soviet Union in World War Two.  Having been invaded by Russia in 1939 and sharing a long border with the superpower, Finland wanted to stay out of future conflicts, giving it the freedom to maintain a strong relationship with Moscow and the West while enjoying a free market economy.  Any NATO expansion is bound to spark anger from Vladimir Putin, who has warned Sweden and Finland against joining. The Russian tyrant has historically pushed back at any eastward expansion of the alliance and has strongly condemned any notions of Ukraine joining. He claimed Ukraine's closeness with the West was one reason behind his invasion. Moscow lawmaker Vladimir Dzhabarov recently warned Finland that a formal application would mean 'the destruction of the country', while another Kremlin spokesman Alexander Grushko threatening 'the most undesirable consequences'.  But Moscow's mounting warnings and threatening rhetoric appear only to have strengthened Finland's and Sweden's resolve to join. It comes after Britain pledged yesterday to come to Sweden and Finland's aid should either of the countries come under Russian attack.  Boris Johnson signed security pacts with his Swedish and Finnish counterparts during visits to the countries on Wednesday. The pacts could see British troops sent to the two nations in the event of a Russian invasion from '21st century tyrant' Putin - who has threatened 'military and political consequences' should either country join the NATO alliance. Johnson said the countries must be free to decide whether to join NATO without 'fear of retaliation' in a stark message to Putin. The PM said the 'mutual security assurances' would see the countries involved come to each other's aid in the event of an attack. Asked whether British troops could be sent to Finland in the event of a Russian invasion, the PM said: 'Yes, we will come to each other's assistance including with military assistance.' He said the UK would be prepared to offer Sweden 'whatever Sweden requested', if Moscow followed through with threats of a military offensive. Speaking at a press conference in Helsinki alongside Niinisto, Johnson said the two countries would 'always come to one another's aid'. 'The security declaration, the solemn declaration we have signed today, ensures that our two nations can intensify our partnership and take it to unparalleled heights, both latitudinal and metaphorical,' he said. 'From the high north, to the Baltics and beyond, our armed forces will train, operate and exercise together, marrying our defence and security capabilities and formalising a pledge that we will always come to one another's aid. 'Because this is not a short-term stop gap, Sauli. 'This is not a short-term stop gap as you consider Nato membership, but an enduring assurance between two nations, an assurance that brings us ever closer as we face the challenges of today, the threats of tomorrow, side by side.' Iro Sarkka, a NATO expert from the University of Helsinki, told AFP before the announcement that Niinisto, who had refrained from revealing his stance on membership, had nonetheless dropped hints that he was leaning toward supporting a bid. 'The president no longer talks about the EU defence option or the role of Finland as the mediator between the East and the West,' she said. On Wednesday, the Finnish parliament's defence committee also concluded that membership of NATO would be the 'best option' for Finland's security, as the Russian invasion had eroded the security situation in Europe. More than 80 years ago, the small Finland took on the might of the Soviet Union when dictator Joseph Stalin ordered an invasion after its government refused to give up substantial territory. The Winter War of 1939-1940 - which began less than three months after the start of the Second World War - saw Finland's forces use innovative tactics to defy Russia's hopes for a quick, emphatic victory that could have landed Stalin control of the whole country. Instead, Soviet troops - who numbered around one million - were fiercely resisted for nearly three months, with dramatic photos showing how vehicles and equipment had to be abandoned in the face of the opposition and freezing conditions. In that time, Russia suffered more than 300,000 casualties - including 126,900 deaths - and lost up to 3,500 tanks and around 500 aircraft. By comparison, Finland lost 25,900 men out of an original force of around 300,000. Stories of Finnish heroics include that of a Finnish farmer who became the deadliest sniper in history after killing 505 Soviet troops. In the fighting, Finland also pioneered the use of the improvised grenade the Molotov cocktail, which was named after the Soviet Union's foreign minister. Ultimately however, the sheer numerical superiority of the Soviet Union's forces took its toll and Finland's government was eventually forced to sign a peace agreement that forced them to give up around ten per cent of their territory. Despite the defeat, Finland emerged with its sovereignty intact and its international reputation enhanced, whilst the Soviet Union was kicked out of the League of Nations and was condemned by other world leaders for the illegal invasion. Finnish sniper Simo Hayha emerged a hero after racking up the most sniper kills in the history of warfare. Aged 33 when the war broke out, Hayha quickly acquired a fearsome reputation, striking the enemy unseen and unheard from hidden positions up to 300 yards from his target. Nicknamed The White Death, Hayha was a prime target for the Soviets, who targeted him with mortars and heavy artillery to halt his killing spree, which once claimed 25 men in one day. Finland then allied with Nazi Germany against the Soviets in what was known as the Continuation War in 1941, with Helsinki trying to retake its lost territories. After a ceasefire was agreed in the Moscow Armistice in 1944, Finland was ordered to expel Nazi troops stationed in the country, prompting the Lapland War with Germany. At the Paris Peace Treaty, Finland was classified as an ally with Nazi Germany and ordered to pay reparations. The country then pursued a policy of neutrality, maintaining a free market economy and democracy despite enjoying a strong relationship with the Soviet Union.  A large majority in Finland's parliament backs membership. 'It is 100 per cent certain that Finland will apply and quite likely that it will be a member by the end of the year,' researcher Charly Salonius-Pasternak of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs told AFP before Thursday's announcement. For Finland, the next step is for the President and Ministerial Committee on Foreign and Security Policy - a body made up of the president, prime minister and up to six other cabinet ministers - to meet on Sunday. The committee will make the formal decision for Finland to submit an application, with the proposal then presented to parliament. After an official bid is submitted to the alliance, lawmakers in all 30 NATO member states would need to ratify its application, a process that can take months. Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said on Tuesday he believed Finland could be a full NATO member 'at the earliest' on October 1. 'The NATO secretary general has said that this process will take between four and 12 months. My own impression is that it might be closer to four months than 12 months,' Haavisto said. Swedish prime minister Magdalena Andersson said her country would be safer as a result of the mutual assistance agreement with the UK. 'Are we safer with this declaration? Yes we are. Of course this means something.' Finnish president Sauli Niinisto echoed the feeling later, saying the deal with the UK 'increases enormously Finnish security'.  He added he did not view joining the military alliance as a 'zero sum game'. 'Joining Nato would not be against anybody,' the Finnish president said.  Describing the declaration as a 'pivotal moment in our shared history', Mr Johnson added: 'It's pivotal because... the Russian invasion of Ukraine has changed the equation of European security and it has rewritten our reality and reshaped our future. 'We've seen the end of the post-Cold War period and the invasion of Ukraine sadly has opened a new chapter'. Finland shares a lengthy land border with Russia and is only about 250 miles from St Petersburg. Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine has led to a swift turnaround in Finnish and Swedish public opinion in favour of NATO membership, which until recently had little backing. A poll published Monday by Finnish public broadcaster Yle showed that a record 76 percent of Finns now support joining the alliance, up from the steady 20 to 30 percent registered in recent years. Public opinion has also surged in Sweden, albeit to lower levels, with around half of Swedes now in favour. Sweden's ruling Social Democratic Party said Monday it would announce its position on the NATO issue on May 15. A favourable stance would provide a clear parliamentary majority for an application. Elisabeth Braw, an expert on Nordic countries' defence at the American Enterprise Institute, told AFP that even though Stockholm appears more hesitant than Helsinki, she believes the two countries 'will do the application at the same time'. Traditionally accustomed to lengthy consensus-building debates on major issues, Sweden has been caught off-guard by Finland's swift turnaround. 'The Social Democrats in Sweden have always said: 'We'll think about this when Finland joins'... because they thought Finland would never join', Braw said. A policy reversal for the party, which ruled for an uninterrupted 40 years between the 1930s and 1970s, would be historic. Sweden is officially non-aligned militarily, although it is a NATO partner and abandoned its position of strict neutrality after the end of the Cold War. Finland has a long history with Russia. In 1917 it declared independence after 150 years of Russian rule. During World War II, its vastly outnumbered army fought off a Soviet invasion, before a peace deal saw it cede several border areas to the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, Finland remained neutral in exchange for guarantees from Moscow that it would not invade.  So the turnaround in sentiment on NATO would have been unthinkable just a few months ago. As recently as January, Marin said membership was 'very unlikely' during her term. But after two decades of public support for membership remaining steady at 20-30 per cent, the war caused a huge surge. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov euphemistically warned the move would 'not improve' the security situation in Europe. 'We have repeatedly said that the alliance remains a tool geared towards confrontation and its further expansion will not bring stability to the European continent,' Peskov said.

Nathaniel Reece, 41, of Southgate Road, Islington -- who fired the gun -- pleaded guilty to murder on day two of an 11 week trial at the Old Bailey.  Demetrios Kyriacou, 35, of Liverpool Road, Islington, was also found guilty of murder during the trial.  And three men have been convicted of manslaughter: James Nicholson, 36, of no fixed address, Matthew Hardy, 35, of Six Acres Estate, Islington, and Darren Dredge, 40, of no fixed address. Mr Allaway-Muir was in 'the wrong place, at the wrong time' said Detective Chief Inspector Neil John, from the Met's Specialist Crime Command.  'Imani was a young man who had his whole life ahead of him... he was tragically killed in a horrific act of violence that took place in broad daylight just metres away from a children's playground and a football pitch which was full of children,' he added.  Mr Allaway-Muir was fatally shot on Roman Way, N7, having been mistaken for one of the four men who robbed Kyriacou on Carville Street, N4, earlier that day. Kyriacou had his Rolex watch, cash and iPhone stolen, and suffered head injuries from the robbery, as suspects drove off in a black BMW.  Police spoke to Kyriacou after the robbery, who was with his blue Range Rover.  He said he believed the suspects had a knife and he did not know them, but he did not wish to speak further about it.  Shortly after, the defendants met at Hardy's home address on Six Acres Estate in Islington, where Kyriacou was living at the time. At the flat, they located Kyriacou's stolen property by using the 'find my iPhone app.' As they drove to Faraday Close, the defendants picked up a loaded gun and encircled the area on arrival.  Kyriacou and Reece were the last to arrive in the area shortly before 3.20pm. They got out of Kyriacou's blue Range Rover on Faraday Close and went down an alleyway where a group of people, and the stolen property, were located.    Seconds later, Reece shot Mr Allaway-Muir four times on Roman Way, with the men running back to the Range Rover and the vehicles, and fled the area as quickly as possible. Nicholson later collected the gun from Reece and disposed of it. It has not been recovered by the police. Mr Allaway-Muir was found lying on the ground unconscious in a children's playground about 20 metres from the scene by police officers, the London Ambulance Service and London's Air Ambulance.   Despite the efforts of the emergency services, he was pronounced dead at 3.49pm, around 30 minutes after he had been shot.   Officers searched the area of the shooting and found 14 bullet casings as well as an iPhone, two Nokia mobile phones and a snapped SIM card.  The phones and the SIM card belonged to Kyriacou and were part of the property stolen during the earlier robbery. A black BMW was also recovered by police at the scene, which was the same one used by the suspects in the earlier robbery. However, detectives established that Mr Allaway-Muir was not involved in the robbery of Kyriacou.  Tragically, he had arrived at the location where the stolen property was located moments before Kyriacou and Reece appeared.  When Reece opened fire, Mr Allaway-Muir was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. The court heard that while it was Reece who discharged the firearm and took Mr Allaway-Muir's life, the other defendants were all jointly responsible for this death, because in their different ways they knowingly assisted and encouraged the commission of the offence. Detectives from the Met's Specialist Crime Command launched a murder investigation, and were able to prove the defendants' involvement by piecing together CCTV, mobile phone data and ANPR and speaking to a number of people who witnessed the attack.  Kyriacou, Reece, Hardy and Dredge were all arrested in July 2020 shortly after the murder, while Nicholson was arrested in February 2021. They were all charged with murder, however Nicholson, Hardy, and Dredge were convicted of manslaughter.  They will be sentenced at the same court on a date yet to be set. DCI John added: 'Kyriacou had refused the police's help after the robbery and decided to take matters into his own hands, recruiting his friends to take part in his deadly revenge plan.  'The joint actions of these men resulted in the execution of Imani, who paid with his life for a robbery he had no involvement in. 'There is never an excuse for violence, especially violence using an illegal firearm, and everyone in the Met remains committed to tackling violence in all its forms and removing dangerous weapons, and those who carry them, from the streets of London.'    Three other men were found not guilty of all charges.", "d1a0e55cee7175d436ed4ba8fb0b64bf455a270cea1d842edb3390dd": "Republican lawmakers Marjorie Taylor Greene and Dan Crenshaw traded blows on Twitter as they renewed their bitter feud - this time over a $40 billion Ukrainian aid bill. Crenshaw has clashed repeatedly with rightwing firebrand Greene over her bombastic approach to politics. And on Wednesday, he suggested her opposition to the humanitarian and military assistance bill was part of an effort to woo the Russian establishment and its state-controlled media. 'Still going after that slot on Russia Today huh?' he said as they traded barbs on the wisdom of backing Ukraine. Their spat brought to the surface divisions between Republicans in handling the war in Ukraine, and whether it risked increased blowback from Moscow.  And it was a reminder of the way the pair clashed last year when Greene said the former Navy SEAL was 'firing blanks' after he complained about 'grifters' and 'performance artists' in their party. Their latest showdown followed a 368-57 House vote, with only Republicans opposing a measure to give billions in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Opponents cited its impact on the U.S. national debt or fears of becoming too deeply involved in the conflict.  Crenshaw made clear his support.  'Yeah, because investing in the destruction of our adversary's military, without losing a single American troop, strikes me as a good idea,' he tweeted.  'You should feel the same.' At that point Greene piped up, suggesting he was effectively advocating for a proxy war against Moscow. 'You speak as if Ukrainian lives should be thrown away, as if they have no value,' she responded. 'Just used and thrown away. For your proxy war?  'How does that help Americans? How does any of this help?' Throughout the conflict, a wing of Trump-allied Republicans has been wary of backing Ukraine too heavily against Vladimir Putin's invasion. They have blamed N.A.T.O. expansion in Europe for pushing Moscow to invade, bringing accusations that they were parroting Putin's talking points. Hence, Crenshaw's jibe about seeking a slot on Russia Today. But it is not the first time the two have clashed.  Greene has a record of making incendiary comments, from sharing QAnon conspiracy theories to apparently condoning violence against Democrats.  And several House Republicans have said that the likes of Greene are drowning out more moderate voices with extreme views.  Crenshaw is among those who fear a vocal fringe could deter voters in the midterm elections. 'There are two types of members of Congress: there is performance artists and there is legislators,' Crenshaw said during a campaign event in Houston, Texas, in December. 'Performance artists are the ones who get all of the attention, the ones you think are more conservative because they know how to say slogans real well.  'They know how to recite the lines that they know our voters want to hear.'  He went on to point to members of the House Freedom Caucus, which includes the likes of Greene, Matt Gaetz, and Jim Jordan, for failing to vote with former President Trump.  'What you hear so often is not true,' said the former Green Beret, who has found a niche as Trump supporter that is not afraid to speak out against the worst excesses of the MAGA movement. 'It's not true. We have grifters in our midst... I mean in the conservative movement. 'Lie after lie after lie because they know something psychologically about the conservative heart.  'We're worried about what people are doing to do to us, what people are going to infringe upon us, that's the nature of conservatism.'   Greene quickly hit back in a tweet. 'Recent attacks from our conference on the @freedomcaucus not only misses the mark, it tells more about the guy shooting with blanks,' she wrote on Wednesday. 'It's a lot better for him to move to the right than disappoint the audience he performs for.'

As the Wagatha Christie trial entered a third day, Rebekah was quizzed by Coleen Rooney's barrister David Sherborne about the extent of her contacts with journalists during the tournament.  In response, the WAG claimed she did not have any contact with the media because she was too busy washing her clothes in the sink. 'I was busy with the kids and under so much stress,' she said. 'We even had to wash our own clothes in the sink at the hotel.'  Earlier today, Rebekah was dramatically accused of lying after she blamed heavy drinking for failing to remember the details of a paparazzi shot she allegedly helped to set up during the tournament.  She denied the allegation this morning. But when asked for details by Mr Sherborne she said: 'If I'm completely honest I had been drinking quite a bit.' Mr Sherborne cuttingly replied: 'I would hope you're honest because you're sitting in a witness box.' He then added: 'Mrs Vardy, this is the first time that you have suggested that your recollection of events has been affected by drinking - that's a lie, isn't it?'    The group of WAGs in the snap included Marcus Rashford's girlfriend Lucia Loi, Kyle Walker's partner Annie Kilner and Harry Maguire's fiancee Fern Hawkins - who was left 'upset and embarrassed' when it emerged in the media. Rebekah said Ms Watt had arranged for a photographer to take pictures of her as she left her hotel but denied giving the photographer the location of either the hotel or the restaurant where the WAGs were having dinner. The court heard Rebekah texted Ms Watt about travel arrangements from the hotel to the restaurant.  There were exchanges about last minute changes in travel arrangements on the night."}
