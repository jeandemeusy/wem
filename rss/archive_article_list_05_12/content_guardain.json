{"495417841d36517852db05175c36d9aef924c76927efb01c34911416": "A Ukrainian commander in Mariupol has appealed directly to Elon Musk on Wednesday, asking the world's richest man to intervene on behalf of those trapped by Russian forces in control of the southern city, AFP reports. The three-month-old war has devastated the strategic port, where Ukrainians have sustained a pocket of resistance from within the Azovstal steelworks after weeks of bloody battle. Serhiy Volyna, commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, said he created a Twitter account for the sole purpose of reaching out to Musk. 'People say you come from another planet to teach people to believe in the impossible,' Volyna tweeted at Musk. 'Our planets are next to each other, as I live where it is nearly impossible to survive. Help us get out of Azovstal to a mediating country. If not you, then who?' He called on 'every person on the planet Earth' to help ensure Musk saw his appeal. Earlier this week, Kyiv said that more than 1,000 of its troops, many of them injured, remained in the sprawling Azovstal plant, sheltering in the labyrinth of Soviet-era bunkers and tunnels from the Russians who now control Mariupol. Women, children and the elderly have been evacuated from the besieged site as part of a humanitarian mission coordinated by the United Nations and the Red Cross. Twitter, which Musk is seeking to buy in a $44 billion deal, has seen an explosion of users due to the war in Ukraine, with people using the social media service to find news and support, according to the company. Musk, who has more than 92 million followers, has previously used the platform to challenge Russian president Vladimir Putin to 'single combat' over Ukraine. Last month, the South African-born Tesla chief responded to a Ukrainian plea for internet service by activating his Starlink satellite broadband service and sending equipment to help bring connectivity to areas hit by Russian military attacks. Finland is expected to announce its intention to join Nato on Thursday with Sweden likely to follow soon after, diplomats and officials have said, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine reshapes European security and the Atlantic military alliance. Nato allies expect Finland and Sweden to be granted membership quickly, five diplomats and officials told Reuters, paving the way for increased troop presence in the Nordic region during the one-year ratification period. In the lead-up to their Nato accession, British prime minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday promised to defend Sweden and Finland against potential Russian threats as he travelled to both countries to sign mutual security agreements. In the wider Nordic region, Norway, Denmark and the three Baltic states are already Nato members, and the addition of Finland and Sweden would probably anger Moscow, which says enlargement of the organisation is a direct threat to its own security. Russian president Vladimir Putin has cited the issue as a reason for his actions in Ukraine, which has also expressed a desire to eventually join the alliance. Moscow has also repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining the alliance, threatening 'serious military and political consequences'. Asked on Wednesday if Finland would provoke Russia by joining Nato, president Sauli Niinisto said Putin would be to blame. 'My response would be that you caused this. Look at the mirror,' Niinisto said. Read on here: Russia 'is today the most direct threat to the world order with the barbaric war against Ukraine, and its worrying pact with China,' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said after talks with Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida. Von der Leyen and European Council president Charles Michel are in Japan for talks that have touched on Russia's invasion of Ukraine but also growing concerns about China's role in Asia and beyond, AFP reports. The annual summit comes with much of the international community rallying to pressure Moscow over Ukraine. Beijing's increasingly muscular stance in Asia was also on the agenda, with the EU looking to take a more high-profile role in confronting China. Japan and the EU have been working to strengthen ties, including with a landmark 2019 trade deal, and Tokyo has broken with past diplomatic postures to take a strong stand on Ukraine. It has sanctioned Russian businesses and officials, sent humanitarian and financial aid to Ukraine and joined a G7 pledge to phase out or ban Russian oil. Japan has, however, stopped short of measures on gas because of its reliance on energy imports. Hello and welcome to the Guardian's live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. A roundup of the latest developments:", "2df06bf2cc3f48816eb5317c9c139e82edc72182c2199a950ffedaf0": "Finland must apply to join Nato 'without delay' in the wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine, its president and prime minister have said, signalling a historic shift in the country's security policy that drew a blunt warning of retaliation from the Kremlin. With neighbouring Sweden expected to follow suit, Sauli Niinisto, Finland's president, and Sanna Marin, the prime minister, made the call in a joint statement, adding: 'We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.' Nato membership would strengthen Finland's security, the two leaders said, and as a member of Nato, 'Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance. Finland must apply for Nato membership as a matter of urgency'. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia would 'definitely' see Finnish membership as a threat, and the foreign ministry in Moscow said it would have to take 'military-technical' steps if Helsinki applied for Nato accession. 'The expansion of Nato and the approach of the alliance to our borders does not make the world and our continent more stable and secure,' Peskov said. 'Everything will depend on how this process takes place, how far the military infrastructure moves towards our borders.' Russia's foreign ministry said Moscow would be 'forced to take reciprocal steps ... to address the resulting threats to its national security'. It accused Nato of seeking to create 'another flank for the military threat to our country' and said Helsinki should 'be aware of its responsibility and the consequences of such a move'. The Finnish daily Iltalehti reported that key Finnish politicians had been told Russia could halt gas supplies to Finland on Friday, although it did not say where the warning came from or whether it was in response to the Nato announcement. Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia and has for decades maintained a strict policy of military non-alignment, viewing membership of the US-led alliance as an unnecessary provocation of Moscow. However, Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has led to a profound change in its thinking, and looks likely to usher in the very expansion of the western military alliance that the Russian president aimed to prevent. Public support for Nato membership has trebled in Finland, with the latest poll by the public broadcaster Yle showing 76% of Finns in favour compared with about 25% before the invasion, with only 12% against. The president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make the formal decision on submitting Finland's membership application. A positive decision would then be presented to parliament for approval early next week. Sweden's ruling Social Democrats are scheduled to decide on Sunday whether to overturn their longstanding opposition to Nato membership, paving the way for a probable application from Stockholm also to join the 30-nation alliance. Sweden's foreign minister, Ann Linde, said Niinisto and Marin's statement was 'an important message', adding that Finland was 'Sweden's closest security and defence partner' and its assessments 'must be taken into account'. Sweden's Expressen daily, citing unnamed sources, said Stockholm's final decision would be made on Monday, with a formal application for membership to be submitted soon afterwards. Nordic media have previously said the two countries were likely to submit a joint application. Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Finland would be 'warmly welcomed' into the alliance and promised the accession process would be 'smooth and swift', although ratification by all 30 members could take several months. Finland is one of Nato's 'closest partners, a mature democracy, a member of the European Union, and an important contributor to Euro-Atlantic security', Stoltenberg said, adding that Finnish membership would prove that the alliance's 'door is open'. Russia has repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the 'serious military and political consequences' of such a move would oblige it to 'restore military balance' by strengthening its defences in the Baltic Sea region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president, said on Thursday that western countries' 'proxy war with Russia' would 'increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between Nato and Russia'. Urging the west not to 'lie to yourself and others' and 'choke in the paroxysms of Russophobia', Medvedev said such a conflict 'always has the risk of turning into a full-fledged nuclear war' and that this would be 'catastrophic for everyone'. Other governments in the region, however, welcomed Helsinki's statement. Denmark's prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Finnish membership would 'strengthen Nato and our common security'. Copenhagen would do everything for a quick admission process, she said. Germany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, tweeted his support, saying he had assured Niinisto of 'the full support of the federal government' in a phone call. Estonia's prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said her country supported Finland's rapid accession. Poland's prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Finland's decision was 'great news for Poland and Europe's security', and the prime minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Fiala, said his country would 'of course' support a Finnish application to join the alliance. Finland's foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, told the European parliament accession to Nato would strengthen security in the region. Norway, Denmark and the three Baltic states were already Nato members and the addition of Finland would 'bring added value', he said. Finland and Sweden are officially non-aligned but became Nato partners - taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence - after abandoning their strict neutrality when they joined the EU in 1995 after the end of the cold war. Finland declared independence in 1917 after more than a century of Russian rule, and its heavily outnumbered army twice fought off Soviet forces during the second world war before ceding some border territory. Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years. Marin and her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said at a joint press conference last month that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had changed Europe's whole security landscape and 'dramatically shaped mindsets' in the Nordic countries. Nato's common security guarantee rests on article 5, the alliance's cornerstone, which says an attack on one Nato member is an attack on all. It has been invoked only once in the organisation's history, in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.", "ec29b4cdc0bbe72ef1cad44f82ddbf716797cbdf3900446a0f1eb452": "When the soldiers of an elite Russian army brigade were told in early April to prepare for a second deployment to Ukraine, fear broke out among the ranks.  The unit, stationed in Russia's far east during peacetime, first entered Ukraine from Belarus when the war started at the end of February and saw bitter combat with Ukrainian forces. 'It soon became clear that not everyone was onboard with it. Many of us simply did not want to go back,' said Dmitri, a member of the unit who asked not to be identified with his real name. 'I want to return to my family - and not in a casket.' Along with eight others, Dmitri told his commanders that he refused to rejoin the invasion. 'They were furious. But they eventually calmed down because there wasn't much they could do,' he said. He was soon transferred to Belgorod, a Russian city close to the border with Ukraine, where he has been stationed since. 'I have served for five years in the army. My contract ends in June. I will serve my remaining time and then I am out of here,' he said. 'I have nothing to be ashamed of. We aren't officially in a state of war, so they could not force me to go.' Dmitri's refusal to fight highlights some of the military difficulties the Russian army has faced as a result of the Kremlin's political decision not to formally declare war on Ukraine - preferring instead to describe the invasion, which will soon reach its fourth month, as a 'special military operation'. Under Russian military rules, troops who refuse to fight in Ukraine can face dismissal but cannot be prosecuted, said Mikhail Benyash, a lawyer who has been advising soldiers who choose that option. Benyash said 'hundreds and hundreds' of soldiers had been in touch with his team for advice on how they could avoid being sent to fight. Among them were 12 national guardsmen from Russia's southern city of Krasnodar who were fired after refusing to go to Ukraine. 'Commanders try to threaten their soldiers with prison time if they dissent, but we tell the soldiers that they can simply say no,' Benyash said, adding that he was not aware of any criminal cases against soldiers who refused to fight. 'There are no legal grounds to start a criminal case if a soldier refuses to fight while on Russian territory.' Many soldiers, therefore, have chosen to be fired or transferred rather than going into 'the meat grinder', he said. A similar account to Dmitri's was given to the BBC's Russian service by Sergey Bokov, a 23-year-old soldier who at the end of April decided to leave the army after fighting in Ukraine. 'Our commanders didn't even argue with us because we were not the first ones to leave,' Bokov said. Pointing to Russia's military laws, Benyash said it would be more difficult for soldiers to refuse to fight if Russia were to declare a full-scale war. 'During wartime, rules are totally different. Refusal then would mean much harsher penalties. They would be looking at time in prison.' While the exact number of soldiers refusing to fight remains unclear, such stories illustrate what military experts and western governments say is one of Russia's biggest obstacles in Ukraine: a severe shortage of infantry soldiers. Moscow initially put about 80% of its main ground combat forces - 150,000 men - into the war in February, according to western officials. But significant damage has been done to that army, which has confronted logistical problems, poor morale and an underestimated Ukrainian resistance. 'Putin needs to make a decision regarding mobilisation in the coming weeks,' said Rob Lee, a military analyst. 'Russia lacks sufficient ground units with contract soldiers for a sustainable rotation. The troops are getting exhausted - they won't be able to keep this up for a long period.' Lee said one option for the Kremlin would be to authorise the deployment of conscript units to Ukraine, despite Putin's earlier pledges that Russia would not use any conscripts in the war. 'Conscripts could fill some of the gaps, but they will be poorly trained. Many of the units that are supposed to train conscripts are fighting themselves,' Lee said. But without conscript battalions, Russia could soon 'struggle to hold the territory it currently controls in Ukraine, especially as Ukraine receives better equipment from Nato,' he said. Russian authorities quietly stepped up their efforts to recruit new soldiers as it became clear that a quick victory in Ukraine was unattainable. An investigation by the BBC's Russian service showed that Russia's defence ministry filled employment websites with vacancies, offering people with no combat experience opportunities to join the army on lucrative short-term contracts. Some large government-run companies have received letters urging them to sign up their staff for the army. Russia has also turned to mercenaries to bolster its war efforts, deploying fighters from the shadowy Kremlin-linked Wagner group. But analysts say voluntary recruits and mercenary groups are unlikely to lead to a substantial increase in the number of new soldiers, compared with the numbers that a partial or a full-scale mobilisation would bring. Despite speculation beforehand, Putin did not formally declare war on Ukraine during his Victory Day speech on 9 May. Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, said the authorities may be worried that a general mobilisation would antagonise large sections of the population that support the 'special operation'. Russians 'might be in favour of the conflict, but they don't actually want to fight,' he said, adding that a general mobilisation would entail 'colossal losses of untrained soldiers'. And while the current status of the conflict gives Russian soldiers a legal path to refuse participation, some soldiers have complained that it has also led to them not being adequately cared for. A junior sergeant said he was injured during one of the recent Ukrainian attacks on the Russian border territory where he was stationed. His superiors argued that he should not be given the monetary compensation of up to PS2,500 that wounded Russians are entitled to by law because his injury took place on Russian soil - meaning it did not fall under the rules of Russia's 'special military operation'. 'It is unfair, I am fighting in this war just as the others in Ukraine, risking my life,' the soldier said. 'If I don't get the compensation that I am entitled to soon, I will go public and make a major issue of it.'", "7a44cb84697c3e641c92431fed7d8122adcc3f56d494e581b58f08e6": "Urgent measures to break the Russian blockade of grain exports from Ukraine's ports, including by trying to open routes through Romanian and Baltic ports, will be discussed by G7 foreign and agriculture ministers at meetings in Germany. The grain exports blockade is fast becoming one of the most urgent diplomatic and humanitarian crises in Ukraine. On Tuesday Joe Biden said the US was working on solutions 'to get this food out into the world so that it could help bring down prices'. G7 foreign ministers are meeting in the Baltic Sea resort of Weissenhaus, north-east of Hamburg, and the agriculture ministers in Stuttgart. Cem Ozdemir, the German agriculture minister and a Green party member, has for months been looking with the EU at alternative train routes through Poland and Belarus to Baltic ports, but the different train gauges between Ukraine and Poland, a pre-existing backlog of traffic and the shortage of suitable rail wagons all count against this option.  By one Ukrainian estimate, only 20% of the exports Ukraine normally sent through the Black Sea ports by ship could ever be transported by rail to the Baltic ports. The cost of road transport has risen fivefold in the past year. Before the war, most of the food produced by Ukraine - enough to feed 400 million people - was exported through the country's seven Black Sea ports. In the eight months before the conflict began, close to 51m metric tonnes of grain passed through them, according to the UN World Food Programme. The trade was worth $47bn (PS38bn) a year to Ukraine. The Ukrainian minister of agricultural policy and food, Mykola Solsky, has studied options ranging from Gdansk or farther east to the port in Klaipeda in Lithuania and three ports in Latvia. The Baltic ports have lost trade from Russia and Belarus, including of potash, and so currently have spare capacity. The Romanian port of Constanta has also taken some shipments of Ukrainian grain, but ships then carrying the grain towards Turkey would probably need to stay within Romanian waters. The UN has also discussed whether a humanitarian corridor could be opened through Belarus to take the grain to the Baltic ports since the track gauge between Ukraine and Belarus is uniform. The UN World Food Programme's David Beasley, who has been sounding the alarm for weeks, said: 'Right now Ukraine's grain silos are full. At the same time, 44 million people around the world are marching towards starvation. We have to open up these ports so that food can move in and out of Ukraine. The world demands it because hundreds of millions of people globally depend on food that comes through these ports.' Typically, Ukraine would export about 5 to 6 million tonnes of grain and 700,000 tonnes of oilseeds through the Black Sea ports a month. There is an estimated backlog for export of anything between 15m and 20m tonnes, according to the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club. Markiyan Dmytrasevych, Ukraine's designated deputy agrarian minister, said exports by rail could be expanded to between 600,000 tonnes and 1m tonnes, but it would take 18 to 24 months to clear the current inventories, and that is before any new crop has been added. In April only 560,000 metric tonnes were exported by rail from Ukraine. Roman Slaston, the director general of the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club, said reopening the ports remained the best option, but exports by road, river barges and rail trucks could be doubled to approximately half what was going through the Ukrainian Black Sea ports. The greatest potential for growth, he said, would come from organising an army of as many as 10,000 trucks transporting grain on a five-day round trip from Ukraine to Baltic ports. He said 40 EU grain terminals could be used by Ukraine. Slaston said as many as 5,000 train wagons loaded with grain at the Polish border were waiting to cross, but currently there was only capacity to bring 350 wagons a day over. After the port city of Odesa was struck by Russian missiles on Monday, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: 'Without our agricultural exports, dozens of countries in different parts of the world are already on the brink of food shortages. The poorest will be hit the hardest. The political repercussions of this will be terrible.' David Miliband, the International Rescue Committee chief executive, said: 'At the moment I think it's at least equally likely that the sanctions on Russia get the blame for the rising food prices as does the invasion of Ukraine. There is a huge contest to be won for public opinion globally.' Signs already exist that Russian diplomacy is trying to shift the blame. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, claimed on a visit to Oman that Ukrainian authorities were refusing to let ships carrying wheat out of their ports and had mined the areas around ports. Ukraine said the accusations were absurd. In 2020 Ukraine was the world's fifth largest exporter of wheat, and low- and middle-income countries were important beneficiaries. The main export destinations were Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Lebanon. In Egypt, where a third of the population lives below the official poverty line and relies on state-subsidised bread, flour prices have risen by 15%. General inflation for April was just over 13%. In the month after the conflict started, export prices for wheat and maize rose by 22% and 20% respectively, on top of steep rises in 2021. Solsky said these rises were likely to continue since Ukrainian farmers' sowing campaign has been delayed by as much as a fifth because of a lack of herbicides, colder weather, diesel fuel and the movement of vehicles because of curfews. Farmers have switched from spring crops to sunflower and soya beans. It is estimated that about a fifth of Ukrainian agricultural land is now in Russian hands.", "37dda19998526b17bbce2ff941a69938d94d87477d28cbe17324aabb": "Finland and Sweden could apply for membership of the 30-nation Nato alliance within days, ending decades of military non-alignment in a historic shift triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Here is a brief look at the background and implications of their decisions. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is a defensive military alliance formed in 1949 by 12 countries including the US, UK and France to counter the threat of postwar Soviet Russian expansion in Europe. Its common security guarantee is based on article 5 of the treaty, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all and commits members to defend each other in the event of armed aggression.  Both considered that joining the alliance would represent an unnecessary provocation of Moscow, and so have long pursued policies of neutrality, and then non-alignment, to avoid antagonising a major regional power. Finland's concerns have been largely practical: it shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, declared independence in 1917 after more than a century of rule by Moscow, and its army twice fought off Soviet forces during the second world war before ceding about 10% of its territory. A 1948 agreement of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with Russia isolated Finland militarily from western Europe, though the breakup of the Soviet Union and EU membership have since allowed it to step out of Russia's shadow. Sweden's opposition to Nato membership has been more ideological. Its postwar foreign policy has focused on multilateral dialogue and nuclear disarmament and it has long seen itself as a mediator on the international stage, running down its military after the end of the cold war. It has reintroduced conscription and boosted defence spending since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but many on the Swedish left remain suspicious of the US-led Nato's agenda and argue that Nato membership will only increase regional tensions. Finland's prime minister, Sanna Marin, and her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said last month that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had 'changed Europe's whole security landscape' and 'dramatically shaped mindsets' in the Nordic region. Essentially, many Finns and Swedes increasingly feel that joining Nato will help keep them safe when they face a plainly belligerent and unpredictable Russian leader. Polls show public support for Nato membership has trebled to about 75% in Finland and surged to about 60% in Sweden. Nato membership would mean that for the first time Finland and Sweden would have security guarantees from nuclear states. Both countries switched from formal neutrality to military non-alignment in 1995 when they joined the EU. They are already Nato partners, taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence with the alliance. Finland already meets Nato's defence spending target of 2% of GDP, while Sweden is on course to do so. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said they would be welcomed 'with open arms' if they do apply and that the accession process would be quick, although formal ratification by all the alliance's members could take several months. From the military perspective, the addition of Finland's and Sweden's armed forces would represent a major boost to Nato's assets in northern Europe, filling a hole in the alliance's defences by doubling the length of its border with Russia and improving security and stability in the Baltic region. Russia has repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the 'serious military and political consequences' of such a move would oblige it to take 'retaliatory steps' to 'restore military balance' by strengthening its defences in the Baltic, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Vladimir Putin sees Nato not as a defensive alliance but as a threat to Russia's security. He blames Nato for blocking his takeover of Ukraine and has demanded Nato troops be withdrawn from eastern Europe. It is unclear how he would respond if he considers the alliance's expansion in northern Europe an existential danger. Finland's president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make a formal decision on submitting an application. A positive decision would then be presented to parliament for approval early next week. Sweden's ruling Social Democrats have been split on the issue and are holding an internal consultation, with a decision also due on Sunday. The party is widely expected to back membership, giving an overwhelming majority of MPs in favour. Swedish media have said a final government decision will be made on Monday, with a formal application for membership to be submitted shortly afterwards. Many analysts believe the two countries will apply simultaneously.", "b267f7695bdd0cd6f486271ae80860f358b34ade74176a2f35776b04": "", "97fd51a1a925c83b7012c4d2190f619a20654d94d4a6236504a42ca1": "A freelance journalist from Spain is spending his 10th week in Polish custody while prosecutors there investigate espionage allegations that appear to be linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a case that raises red flags about press freedom in Europe at a time of war, prosecutors are expected next week to ask a judge for a further three-month extension to the detention of Pablo Gonzalez, who has freelanced for media including Spain's La Sexta TV channel, Spanish state news agency EFE and the US-government funded Voice of America. The prosecutors' request must be filed before 15 May, two weeks before his current three-month detention order expires. Under Polish law, Gonzalez can be held in custody until he is put on trial, a process lawyers say could easily take more than a year. Polish officials claim he is an agent of Russia's infamous GRU military intelligence. 'He carried out operations for the benefit of Russia, profiting from his status of journalist, which enabled him to freely travel around the world and Europe, including military conflict zones,' according to a spokesperson for Poland's minister coordinator of special services. 'Vast evidence has been secured, which now undergoes a detailed analysis,' the spokesperson said, adding that Gonzalez faces 10 years in jail for taking part in 'activities of foreign intelligence services against the Republic of Poland'. Friends and family claim the allegations are absurd and have demanded Gonzalez be tried or freed immediately. 'I have no doubt he is not a spy,' said Juan Teixeira, a Spanish journalist who has travelled with him to many countries over a dozen years. Gonzalez, who was born in Russia and has joint Spanish and Russian nationality, was detained after agents from Poland's internal security agency (ABW) knocked on his hotel door in the border town of Przemysl shortly after midnight on 27 February. He had been covering the refugee crisis and also planned to report from the Ukrainian side of the border. Gonzalez's Polish lawyer, Bartosz Rogala, said he was well and had been visited by the Spanish consul. His wife, Oihana Goiriena, complained that family letters and parcels had been delayed or not handed over. 'They include drawings from his children,' she told the Guardian. Goiriena said her husband made regular visits to see his father in Russia. Gonzalez's two passports give him different names. His Russian passport bears his father's surname Rubtsov and Pavel, the Russian version of Pablo, while his Spanish passport bears his mother's Spanish surname, Gonzalez. Supporters fear this is seen as proof that he was using aliases. That confusion arises because his parents divorced and his mother moved to Spain when Gonzalez was a young boy, registering him under her surname. Gonzalez's maternal grandfather had been one of thousands of Spanish children evacuated to Russia during the Spanish civil war in 1936. Gonzalez speaks Russian, studied Slavic languages at university and specialises in the post-Soviet world, reporting mostly for Spanish outlets - often spending half or more of the year away from the home in Spain's Basque country where his wife and three children live. In 2016, Gonzalez's name appeared on a list reportedly drawn up by academic researchers of 49 Spanish journalists, politicians and activists whose Twitter comments were deemed 'pro-Russian'. 'As someone who works on the ground in the Ukraine ... that is a worry,' he said at the time. He began to have problems reporting early in February, weeks before the invasion on 24 February, when Ukrainian authorities questioned him while he was waiting for a live link with La Sexta with military positions behind him. He was told to report to the Ukrainian intelligence service in Kyiv, where he was advised to leave the country but not formally expelled. Gonzalez sought advice from the Spanish consulate then left for Poland. A few days later, agents from Spain's centre for national intelligence (CNI) visited the family home near the town of Guernica and quizzed his wife. 'There was nothing aggressive about it and they did not come into the house,' she said. 'They suggested that he might be pro-Russian. I don't actually know what that means, after all a Russian national can be both pro-Russian and anti-Putin.' When Gonzalez heard about the visit, he returned to Spain. But when war broke out, he immediately left for Poland. 'He's a journalist. That's how he makes his living,' said Goiriena. Friends said he also believed Ukraine would allow him back. The Paris-based journalists' NGO Reporters without Borders is watching closely. 'The Polish authorities must be more transparent about the evidence they hold against him, because so far information is scarce and detaining a journalist for months without trial is very serious,' a spokesperson said. 'Pablo Gonzalez's fundamental rights need to be respected in Poland, an EU democracy.' Gonzalez spent his 40th birthday in jail last month. Rogala, Gonzalez's lawyer, said he would ask the court to release his client without charges or, at least, free him on bail next week. Hearings will be held behind closed doors.", "aba570217c4be346b39f97c0105256240611b79b5b230a1b9f574a25": "A baseball signed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has sold at auction for more than $50,000, with a portion of the proceeds going to Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion.

The select committee empowered the chairman, Bennie Thompson, to move ahead with subpoenas to the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Mo Brooks of Alabama. The five congressmen flatly refused to accept invitations to provide voluntary assistance to the investigation, sources said. A spokesperson for the panel declined to comment late on Wednesday night, and did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday morning. The committee is seeking to compel the Republican members of Congress to share some of the most sensitive information about Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, sources said. The Guardian reported earlier this week that the panel was moving closer to issuing subpoenas to Republicans in Congress, appalled at their refusal to assist in any way despite prima facie connections to the events of 6 January. What changed for members of the committee, according to sources familiar with internal deliberations, was that they could no longer ignore what appeared to be deep involvement in Trump's unlawful schemes to overturn the 2020 election results. The scope and targets of the subpoenas are not final until the orders are made public. But the subpoenas were expected to encompass the contents of the letters seeking voluntary cooperation, they said. That would indicate the committee intends to ask McCarthy about what he knew of the former president's involvement in, and response to, the Capitol riots, as well as why Trump believed McCarthy was at fault for the riot. It also suggests House investigators are interested in seeking more detail about meetings between Trump and Republican members of Congress at the White House before the Capitol attack, at which they strategised about how to stop certification of Joe Biden's win on 6 January. The letters to Jordan and Biggs made explicit reference to at least one December 2020 meeting that involved the former president and Republicans in Congress, which is understood to have been attended by the House Freedom Caucus, a hard-right group. The panel made a particularly expansive request to Biggs, also seeking details about what he knew of plans by pro-Trump activists to march from the 'Save America' rally at the Ellipse on 6 January to the Capitol, through his contacts with the activist Ali Alexander and others. Biggs's potential contacts with Alexander are of special interest to the investigation, sources said. The committee is trying to untangle claims by Alexander that he 'schemed up putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting' with Brooks, Biggs and Paul Gosar, another Arizona Republican, and his testimony that he spoke to Biggs's staff and the congressman himself. Alexander obtained a permit to hold a rally at the Capitol on 6 January but that event never took place. Alexander was instead filmed going up the Capitol steps in a 'stack' formation with members of the Oath Keepers militia. Thompson said the panel wanted to ask Biggs about his efforts to pressure legislators to create 'alternate' slates of electors for Trump in states he lost, as well as an alleged request he made to Trump for a pardon in the days after the Capitol attack.", "e3eb2fc29320f260df085e7839f476d39226d8b82014f69fff95d505": "Shireen Abu Aqleh, the Palestinian American journalist shot dead during an Israeli army operation, has been honoured with a full state memorial in the West Bank city of Ramallah. At least 5,000 people lined the streets on Thursday as her coffin, draped in the Palestinian flag, was driven through the city and the Qalandia checkpoint en route to St Joseph hospital nearer her home in occupied East Jerusalem. Her funeral will be held in the holy city on Friday. Attenders brought wreaths of flowers and waved Palestinian flags as the ambulance carrying her body passed by, escorted by a dozen masked gunmen belonging to the Palestinian Fatah movement. Some people threw rose petals while the militants fired into the air, accompanied by chants of 'From Ramallah to Jenin, God have mercy on you, Shireen' and 'The true voice never dies'. The 51-year-old reporter was shot in the head on Wednesday morning in the West Bank city of Jenin during what her colleagues at the scene said was a surprise burst of Israeli fire on a small group of journalists covering an expected Israeli military raid. Video of the incident shows Abu Aqleh was wearing a helmet and body armour clearly marked 'press'. Ali Samodi, a producer for Al Jazeera who was shot in the back, told the Guardian from his hospital bed that contrary to claims made by Israeli officials, there were no gunmen standing near the journalists when they were targeted. 'There were no fighters around, no civilians, nothing. Just the Israeli soldiers and the press. There were many bullets. After I was hit and Shireen was killed, they just kept shooting,' he said. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) initially said its troops shot back after coming under 'massive fire' from militants in Jenin in the northern West Bank. The town is a historical flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the IDF has been conducting near-daily raids there in the wake of a recent wave of terrorist attacks against Israelis, which have left 19 dead. Many of the perpetrators came from the Jenin area. Israeli officials, including the prime minister, Naftali Bennett, initially insisted there was 'a considerable chance that armed Palestinians, who fired wildly, were the ones who brought about the journalist's unfortunate death.' But later on Wednesday the Israeli military chief Lt Gen Aviv Kochavi and the defence minister, Benny Gantz, appeared to back away from those assertions. Gantz conceded it could have been 'the Palestinians who shot her' or fire from 'our side', adding: 'We are not sure how she was killed. We are investigating.' The IDF circulated what it said was a video of militants in Jenin engaged in a gunfight on the morning Abu Aqleh was shot, in which they claimed to have hit a soldier. The footage was challenged by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, which visited the two locations and found from the GPS coordinates that it was impossible for the shooting depicted in the IDF-distributed video to be the same gunfire that hit Abu Aqleh and Samodi. Israel has denied allegations from the Qatar-based Al Jazeera that the journalists were 'intentionally targeted' and Abu Aqleh was 'assassinated in cold blood'. The correspondent's death has led to grief and condemnation across the Palestinian territories and the Middle East. Abu Aqleh was a familiar face to millions, reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in often dangerous circumstances for Al Jazeera's Arabic channel since 1997. In an unusual move, considering Abu Aqleh's reporting was often critical of the Palestinian Authority (PA), but in an indication of the respect for her across Palestinian society, a memorial service for the reporter was held at the Ramallah compound of PA president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Thursday morning. Foreign diplomats, journalists, religious leaders and prominent Palestinian and Arab Israeli politicians were in attendance as Abbas vowed 'this crime should not go unpunished,' adding that the PA held Israel 'completely responsible' for her death and had 'refused and rejected' an Israeli proposal for a joint investigation into the killing. 'We refused a joint investigation because [Israelis] are the criminals and we don't trust them,' he said. 'We will go to the international criminal court to uncover the truth.' The ICC launched an investigation into possible Israeli war crimes over a year ago, although Israel has rejected the probe as biased. Hussein al-Sheikh, a senior aide to Abbas, has rejected an Israeli request to conduct ballistic analysis on the bullet, saying the PA would conduct its own investigation and convey the results 'with high transparency' to Abu Aqleh's family, the US, Qatar and the public. Bennett accused the Palestinians on Thursday of denying Israel 'access to the basic findings required to get to the truth'. He called on the PA not to take 'any steps to disrupt the investigation or to contaminate the investigation process'. The EU has called for an independent inquiry while the US has demanded the killing be 'transparently investigated' - calls echoed by the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet. An initial autopsy and forensic examination were conducted in the West Bank city of Nablus hours after Abu Aqleh's death, but no final conclusions have been disclosed. The journalist's funeral will take place on Friday at a Roman Catholic church in Jerusalem before she is buried in the family plot in the city's Mount Zion cemetery. 'Shireen's killing was a message to the Palestinian people to try and kill our spirit,' said Mufaz Jaba, 38, who attended the memorial procession in Ramallah. 'Instead it's the opposite. Her death has helped unite Palestinian society and reminded the world of how important the Palestinian cause is,' he said.", "48017165010e12ca67cae67b2140f2161c8b41cee42ede6a2ace361d": "The 20-year manhunt for one of the world's most brutal killers has come to a decisive end in an overgrown cemetery outside Harare. The body of Protais Mpiranya, the former commander of the Rwandan presidential guard indicted for genocide, lay buried under a stone slab bearing a false name, which UN investigators tracked down and identified with the help of a critical lead found on a confiscated computer: the hand-drawn design for Mpiranya's tombstone. His body was exhumed last month at the request of UN investigators, and Mpiranya's identity was confirmed by DNA analysis on Tuesday. Serge Brammertz, the UN prosecutor who led the hunt, said he was the last of the major fugitives and finding his body 'provides the solace of knowing that he cannot cause further harm'. The man charged with overseeing the slaughter of thousands of Rwandans, and abetting the murder of many more, died in Harare in October 2006 of a heart attack brought on by tuberculosis, at the age of 50. But his death, like much of his life, had been swathed in secrecy by his family and supporters. Mpiranya had been living in Zimbabwe under an assumed identity for four years, despite its government's insistence that he was not in the country. The investigation that followed his trail all the way to the grave in Granville cemetery on the southern edge of Harare found he had arrived on a Zimbabwean military plane and had been in frequent contact during his stay with Zimbabwean officials in the then president Robert Mugabe's regime who were well aware of his identity as a valued ally in the second Congo war of 1998-2003. 'That the Zimbabweans, at least elements of the authorities, knew he was in Harare is obvious,' said a senior official involved in the investigation. 'He was even seen meeting with Zimbabwean officials. Of course he was trying to hide his identity from the public, but the entire reason he went to Zimbabwe is because of his relationships there.' The Guardian has asked the Zimbabwean government for comment. As a fugitive, Mpiranya had outlasted the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, established in 1994 to bring the genocidaires to justice after the genocide that killed up to 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. It had indicted him on eight counts, including genocide and crimes against humanity, but was unable to find him to make him stand trial. After the tribunal closed in 2015, a 'residual mechanism' was set up to wrap up old cases, and part of that mechanism was a small tracking team under Brammertz's command as chief prosecutor. At 7am on 7 February, members of the team arrived at the cemetery, where the graves were invisible beneath head-high grass. It took two and a half hours to find what they were looking for: a black headstone in memory of a Sambao Ndume whose date of birth matched Mpiranya's, 30 May 1956. A team member recalled the discovery of the grave: 'There was that moment when my colleague called out: 'Found it!' And we all just stood there looking at it. It was exactly as we thought it would be,' he said. 'All that hard work, the ups and the downs, it had led to this moment.' The French inscription on the tombstone read: 'Here rests forever one who loved his fatherland, his people and his family, more than his own life.' Below that, a crude depiction of a warrior with bow and arrow was carved with the message: 'Dad RIP'. The path that had led the trackers to the grave was long, convoluted and dotted with dead ends. There were supposedly eyewitness reports from across Africa from people claiming to have seen him, and until late last year the investigators believed he was probably still alive, hiding out in Zimbabwe with his fellow combatants from the Congo war. By May 2020, Mpiranya was the last major fugitive among the 93 accused indicted by the ICTR, and the most wanted war crimes suspect in the world. As head of the Rwandan presidential guard in 1994, according to his indictment, he had given his men a kill list of prominent Tutsis and orders to kill their families too. He armed and trained the notorious Interahamwe Hutu militia, responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths. And with the signal for the bloodletting to begin, the shooting down of the plane carrying the country's president, Juvenal Habyarimana, on 5 April 1994, he sent his men to set up roadblocks at which Tutsis were massacred. Soldiers from the presidential guard murdered the prime minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, a moderate Hutu, and mutilated her body. The 10 lightly armed Belgian soldiers who had been sent to protect her were shot and hacked to death with machetes. After the fall of the Hutu regime in July 1994, Mpiranya fled across Africa, spending four years in Cameroon until it became inhospitable for genocidaire fugitives. He moved on to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), fighting with Hutu forces and Zimbabwean troops on behalf of the country's president Laurent Kabila, against the Rwandan army, in what became known as the second Congo war. Zimbabwean officers saw the former commander as a cut above most of the Congolese troops they were fighting alongside . 'He developed a lot of relationships with these guys during the war,' a senior official in the prosecutor's office said. 'They respected him. He was a good commander, a professional, someone who listened, asked questions and took decisions. He was very security conscious. So he impressed the Zimbabweans when others they were working with did not.' So when Mpiranya was first indicted in September 2002, his friends and admirers in Zimbabwe helped spirit him across borders. According to witnesses, he flew from Mbuji-Mayi in central DRC to Harare on a Zimbabwean military plane. Mpiranya brought a small entourage of Hutu commanders with him and, using a fake identity, set up a small transport business with two large vans, bought most likely with proceeds from Congolese diamonds. He was better at giving orders than doing business. The venture floundered, and over the four years in Zimbabwe, Mpiranya's standard of living crumbled. Starting off in a substantial villa in the first year, the family had to downgrade to an apartment in the same area and then another in a more down-at-heel neighbourhood. They stopped hiring conductors for the buses and a family member had to do the work themselves. Then both buses were in accidents and there was no money to repair them. Much of the rest of his assets were wiped out by Zimbabwean high inflation in those years. When Mpiranya fell sick with tuberculosis, he had no money left to pay for his medical care and his wife in the UK had to take on more work to send funds. Filling in the forms for hospital admission, he used a new identity, Sambao Ndume, the name he would be buried under. The UN investigators believe his family and friends covered up the death so as not to dent morale among the Hutu forces in DRC - and so as not to expose themselves to scrutiny. The tracking team found several had secured safe haven in the UK and EU with bogus asylum claims. The tribunal tracking team spent the time chasing wispy leads around Africa, provided by informants either seeking to cover up Mpiranya's death, or looking to make money, or both.'The family and his associates deliberately concealed for the last two decades his presence in Harare and his death,' Brammertz told the Guardian. 'The investigative file was filled with information that he was quite active, with businesses and associates in several countries. My predecessors, and perhaps even myself at the beginning, focused more on those leads.' Over the past few years, the tracking team went back over the entire investigation, reviewing the databases, interviewing and re-interviewing witnesses, stripping out tips and speculation, and the investigators' own possible bias, back to the last fact in Mpiranya's life they knew for sure: he was in the DRC in 2002. They reconstructed every known detail of his life, his mindset and connections. The breakthrough came last September with the seizure of a computer and other material in a raid in a European country (which the Guardian is not allowed to identify). Combing through a mass of data, they came across emails with veiled references to 'the one who has a passed' and the 'old man'. Then they cross-checked with the travel of some of Mpiranya's relatives, from visa stamps sent by partner governments, and found them converging on Zimbabwe in October 2006. Sifting through hundreds of digital pictures, they found photos of a funeral including those of the body laid out for the mourners. It looked like Mpiranya and was dressed in a suit that the investigators later found in the grave. Finally, they found the photo of a hand-drawn picture of a gravestone, sent by a close relative, and realised it was a commission for the stone carvers of Harare. If they could find a stone like that, they could find the body. After years of stalling the search, the Zimbabwean authorities agreed to allow the body of the man calling himself Sambao Ndume to be dug up. On 27 April, the trackers, a UN pathologist, and three Zimbabwean detectives gathered at the grave as the sun rose. About 20 riot police had been sent along as well, torpedoing any hopes that it could be done quietly. The conspicuous police presence drew a small crowd of curious local residents. The gravediggers worked their way down to the coffin with spades, and then the pathologist took over, climbing down into the grave to take a careful sample, without disturbing the rest of the body, with a deference Mpiranya had not accorded to his multitude of victims. Prosecutors are still looking for five more indictees, and Brammertz believes the discovery of Mpiranya's body will increase the pressure on the governments of other countries, where the last ageing fugitives are thought to be hiding. But Mpiranya was the last of the main figures of the Rwandan genocide to be accounted for, although he had succeeded in avoiding a trial. 'Of course the goal is to arrest fugitives,' Brammertz said. 'But we need to account for them, one way or the other. First, because as they say themselves, survivors and victims want a final answer. 'And second, to say this person is dead means they can't cause further harm, and they aren't living this nice life as a fugitive somewhere while the victims try to rebuild their lives. 'And, of course, for the UN and our mandate,' he added, 'we have to demonstrate our determination and that we go all the way.'", "5b5b2e98a321833a1d2d2a96a3457b4b08b3579d64f111e0f87184f9": "A delegation of influential US congressmen will fly to London within days amid growing concern in the White House about spiralling tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol, the Guardian can reveal. With the UK government poised to table legislation next week which could revoke parts of the protocol, arrangements are being made for at least half a dozen representatives from the US Congress to fly to Europe for a series of meetings in Brussels, Dublin, London and Belfast. The delegation will be headed by the influential chair of the ways and means committee, Richie Neal, which has significant power over future trade deals. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has previously said the US intends to appoint its own envoy to Northern Ireland. Neal, whose interest in Northern Ireland stretches over three decades, said earlier this year that a trade deal was 'desirable' but that it would not progress if there was 'any jeopardy' to the Good Friday agreement. The delegation is likely to underline President Biden's commitment to defending the Good Friday agreement and the US's role as a guarantor. He has repeatedly emphasised how integral the protocol is to maintaining peace and stability. 'The best path forward is a pragmatic one that requires courage, co-operation and leadership,' a White House spokesman said of the UK's dispute with the EU. Boris Johnson is expected to give a speech as soon as Monday on the future of the protocol after exchanges between the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the European Commission vice-president, Maros Sefcovic, which a UK source described as 'tetchy'. In a phone call, Truss said that unless the EU showed the 'requisite flexibility' in talks over the trading arrangements she would have 'no choice but to act'. Johnson, who negotiated the protocol as part of the Brexit agreement, firmly backed Truss on Thursday, saying 'institutions set up under the Good Friday agreement aren't functioning' and political governance in Northern Ireland has collapsed. 'The people of Northern Ireland need leadership, they need a regional, a provincial government ... they haven't got that,' Johnson said, after a discussion of the strategy with cabinet ministers. 'That's a real problem. And the reason they don't have that is because there's one community in Northern Ireland that won't accept the way the protocol works at present - we've got to fix that.' The UK has sent Johnson's close ally Conor Burns as an envoy on the protocol to speak to senior figures in Washington over the course of the week, including meeting a special Northern Ireland committee of congressmen on Friday. Both Truss and Burns have argued that negotiations have reached a crunch point because of the impasse at Stormont, where the Democratic Unionist party has said it will not re-enter the Northern Ireland executive while the issues with the protocol remain. On Thursday, Truss and Sefcovic spoke for the first time since it was revealed the UK was considering tabling draft legislation to unilaterally override part of the trading arrangements. The standoff between the two is testing wider relations with the EU at a time when 'bigger things', such as Finland joining Nato, are happening, Ireland's foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said on Thursday. A UK government source said Truss had argued that the lack of a functioning executive in Northern Ireland was a key security concern that merited the response. 'Liz's primary concern in all this is upholding the Belfast Good Friday agreement,' they said. 'The protocol is the major cause of political instability - disrupting trade and creating a two-tier system where people in Northern Ireland are treated differently to the rest of the UK. So it's clear and obvious that we need to change the parts that aren't working. 'If the EU won't help us do that and show more pragmatism, then we'll have to take action that solves those problems. That would very much be in disappointment rather than anger.' David McAllister, a German centre-right MEP who chairs the European parliament's UK coordination group, said the EU was united against renegotiating the protocol. 'The protocol was signed and ratified by both sides. Nobody here in Brussels is interested in starting these new complicated discussions and political fights,' he said. Truss said she had told Sefcovic the protocol was 'the greatest obstacle' to forming a new Northern Ireland executive after last week's elections. There are no further plans for the pair to speak. Sefcovic told her there was 'no room to expand the negotiating mandate or introduce new proposals to reduce the overall level of trade fiction', according to a Foreign Office statement. The government called it a matter of 'regret' that the EU 'would not show the requisite flexibility to help solve those issues ... then, as a responsible government, we would have no choice but to act.' Sefcovic said it remained of 'serious concern that the UK government intends to embark on the path of unilateral action'. He said the EU was still waiting for the UK's response to proposals it made in February. 'We have made clear that there is still potential to be explored in our proposals,' he said. 'Unilateral action, effectively disapplying an international agreement such as the protocol, is simply not acceptable.'", "caa7514c63ed041477079a27bb08ba4abd90546f5e274be10db958ac": "Iranian authorities have arrested a French teaching union official and her husband and threatened to execute a Swedish-Iranian man who has been held in jail for six years by 21 May, in fresh moves against foreign and dual nationals. The threat to execute Ahmadreza Djalali, a scientist, is widely seen as a reprisal for Sweden starting the trial in Stockholm of Hamid Nouri, who is accused of war crimes and murder committed during and after the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.  The trial of Nouri, arrested in 2019 on a trip to Sweden, is seen as unprecedented. Iran claims the two cases are not related and says Djalali's death sentence will not be rescinded. The French foreign ministry has demanded the immediate release of Cecile Kohler and her husband, who were arrested as they prepared to leave Tehran for Paris on 7 May after a holiday in Iran. Iranian authorities have accused her of 'attempting to create political chaos' by allegedly associating with representatives of the Iranian Teachers Trade Association during her visit. The ministry has summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires in Paris to demand consular access to the couple. There are now four French nationals in Iranian jails. Days after Kohler and her husband were arrested the EU's chief negotiator, Enrique Mora, landed in Tehran to try to revive the Vienna-based talks on the Iran nuclear deal. Those talks have ground to an effective standstill over whether the US is willing to lift sanctions against the Revolutionary Guards. Activists say Iran is engaged in a brazen policy of taking foreigners hostage to extract concessions from the west. Iran denies any such policy and insists all foreigners are tried according to due legal process. However it has repeatedly shown a willingness to exchange prisoners and taken part in swaps in the past. Djalali was arrested in Tehran and charged with spying after a university invited him to attend a workshop. He has been threatened with execution before, but his wife, Vida Mehrannia, has lobbied hard to keep him alive. She says she might be prepared to see her husband swapped for someone the Iranians want released, but not for Nouri - the only swap the Iranians are likely to accept.  Djalali says he was forced to give a false confession under torture and threats, and his family vehemently deny the spying charge against him. Nouri has been charged with international war crimes and human rights abuses in connection with the murders of more than 100 people at the Gohardasht prison in Karaj. His trial is taking place under the principle of universal jurisdiction. The latest repression shows the continuing power of Hossein Taeb, the head of the Revolutionary Guards' intelligence, and the seeming lack of influence of Iran's foreign ministry.", "076460a39ddf4db4a1dc9bc9647927fa00a01d8482ca31835d886f71": "A leading Turkish opposition figure has been banned from politics and sentenced to almost five years in prison, drawing widespread concern about a crackdown on leftwing organisers and politicians before elections expected within the year. An Istanbul appeals court on Thursday confirmed three charges against Canan Kaftancioglu, the head of the Istanbul branch of the main opposition Republican People's party (CHP), upholding her convictions for insulting a public official, publicly insulting the republic of Turkey, and insulting the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in tweets accusing him of theft. She faces a ban on political activity and a prison sentence of four years, 11 months and 20 days. While she could receive a suspended sentence, observers fear that banning the key opposition leader from politics is intended to sideline her before presidential and parliamentary elections. Polls indicate that Erdogan and his Justice and Development party (AKP) are likely to face stiff opposition after a year in which Turkey's currency has halved in value and inflation has reached close to 70%. In response, Kaftancioglu tweeted a video telling her supporters: 'Never stop, do not give up, do not get tired.' She added: 'We will breathe together when we establish the rule of law.' Speaking in Istanbul the same evening, the CHP leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, addressed Erdogan directly. 'All this cruelty stems from your weakness,' he said. Kaftancioglu, an outspoken, motorbike-riding leftist, is thought to have played a central role in helping the CHP win the Istanbul mayoral race in 2019, granting it control of Turkey's largest city. The CHP candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu, won the seat twice after the AKP demanded a re-run of the vote when its candidate first lost. 'For Erdogan this is about the risk of the opposition continuing to organise effectively with figures like Kaftancioglu, who put together a masterful campaign to protect the vote and denied the AKP a repeat victory in 2019,' said Soner Cagaptay, an analyst for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'It was the 100,000 volunteers assembled by Kaftancioglu who observed the tally, compiled documents, took pictures and slept on top of ballot boxes so nothing could be rigged and Imamoglu won. It shows pretty significant organisational skills on her part,' he said. Kaftancioglu had already begun a campaign to train observers before the general election. The CHP was defiant after the ruling. 'If Canan Kaftancioglu is banned, there are tens of thousands of Canans who will be on duty during the elections at the poll stations,' said Unal Cevikoz, a CHP member and retired diplomat. Kaftancioglu's conviction comes after a recent ruling sentencing the leftwing philanthropist Osman Kavala to life in prison over accusations he supported anti-government protests in 2013, as well a demand by prosecutors to silence a leading feminist group. 'I feel like Erdogan is tightening the noose on the opposition's neck,' said Cagaptay. 'It shows that for him, the risk of letting the opposition flourish and organise outweighs the benefits of the investments he might get as a result of his charm offensive towards the west.' A court in Istanbul is expected to rule on charges against Imamoglu in early June. He also faces a ban on political activity and could be jailed over claims he insulted the election officials who cancelled his initial win in 2019. If convicted, the ruling would sideline one of the CHP's potential presidential candidates.", "355ecfa8b15c91eacd9d4b2c42b99cb11ee157eace05e6f8749e2058": "The government has declined a Commons instruction to release information about the decision to make Evgeny Lebedev a peer, saying this would undermine the confidentiality of those nominated and could degenerate into 'political point-scoring'. Labour called the decision 'a cover-up' and promised more action over what it called a contempt of parliament. The announcement said information had instead been provided to parliament's intelligence and security committee (ISC). This prompted an immediate rebuff from the ISC, which said its request for details about Lebedev was separate and should have remained classified. In March a humble address motion tabled by Labour was passed by the Commons amid a threatened Tory rebellion, directing ministers to release information about the elevation of the Russian-born businessman and son of a former KGB officer. The vote, in which Tory MPs were instructed to abstain given the extent of backbench Conservative disquiet on the issue, followed revelations that the intelligence services had concerns about a peerage for Lebedev awarded by Boris Johnson, a close friend. But a Cabinet Office document released on Thursday, running to nine pages, contained no new information beyond a handful of redacted emails, including one in which Lebedev confirmed he had completed a form, and another in which an unidentified official congratulated him on the peerage. The only other information was already known, such as a full list of people made political peers in 2020 alongside Lebedev. In a parallel written statement of explanation, the Cabinet Office minister Michael Ellis said that while the government 'is and remains committed to openness and transparency', it would not abide by the Commons request. Ministers had provided a more detailed response to the ISC 'following a separate request from them for information relating to any national security matters arising', he said. In response, the ISC said it was 'surprised' by Ellis linking the two requests in his statement, adding: 'So far as the ISC is concerned, at this stage our request for information should have remained a private - and classified - matter of oversight.' In his statement, Ellis said ministers had to balance openness with 'the wider public interest', and it would not be helpful to publish details about the scrutiny given to prospective peers. 'I can assure parliament that proper consideration would be given to any information which indicated national security concern arising from a prospective appointment before a decision was made,' he wrote. 'It is essential that the confidentiality of these arrangements is maintained as it is this that ensures the vetting procedures are suitably robust and command confidence, whilst also protecting the private and personal data of those individuals who have entered into the vetting process.' In what was almost a veiled warning about the consequences of agreeing to the request, Ellis wrote: 'Honourable members should be conscious that requests for information on the internal correspondence of the [House of Lords appointments] commission could also be applied to such opposition recommendations (including those which are rejected or withdrawn). I do not believe it would be in the public interest for such internal correspondence to be used in the future for political point-scoring.' He ended: 'Lord Lebedev is a man of good standing.' Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: 'This looks like a cover-up and smells like a cover-up because it is a cover-up. If the prime minister is claiming he was not involved in forcing through the award of a peerage to an individual of concern to our intelligence services, he should come clean and publish the documents as parliament instructed. 'The government is once again seeking to hide in the shadows from the sunlight of scrutiny. We will take steps to rectify this contempt of parliament.' Boris Johnson's deputy spokesperson defended the decision. 'It's our responsibility to protect the integrity of the vetting process which, as you know, is voluntarily entered into on a confidential basis,' they said. 'We are committed to transparency, but the disclosure we have made reflects the need to maintain the integrity of the system.'", "78dedf625ee5536ba35261d9e19f2b0e7a874f8164072e41ed6714ed": "After a month of crippling ransomware attacks, Costa Rica has declared a state of emergency invoking a measure usually reserved to deal with natural disasters or the Covid-19 pandemic to allow the government to react more nimbly to the crisis. President Rodrigo Chaves, who was sworn in on Sunday, made the emergency declaration one of his first acts. It was published on Wednesday, but Chaves has not named the members of the National Emergency Commission. The declaration refers to the attack Costa Rica is suffering at the hands of 'cybercriminals' and 'cyberterrorists'. The Russian-speaking Conti gang had claimed responsibility for the attack. Last week the US state department offered a $10m reward for information leading to the identification or location of Conti leaders. The attack began in April when the finance ministry was the first to report that a number of its systems were affected, including tax collection and customs. Attacks also targeted the social security agency's human resources system and labor ministry. The Costa Rican government has not reported an expansion of the attack, but some systems, especially at the finance ministry, are still not functioning normally. The government has also not made an estimate of the losses caused by the attack. Carlos Alvarado was still president when the attacks began and he said Costa Rica would not pay the gang any ransom. In its statement last week, the US state department said the Conti group had been responsible for hundreds of ransomware incidents during the past two years. 'The FBI estimates that as of January 2022, there had been over 1,000 victims of attacks associated with Conti ransomware with victim payouts exceeding $150,000,000, making the Conti Ransomware variant the costliest strain of ransomware ever documented,' the statement said. In addition to the ransomware state of emergency, Chaves also eliminated pandemic-related obligatory use of masks in public spaces and issued a decree that urged public institutions to not sanction officials who have not been vaccinated against Covid-19, reversing his predecessor's policy.", "cef02845df4d21d927982c4141e62441a6e1c3e0e0756a662cd2c3e3": "", "d67c3450785bde1cec0ed21fbe014af4520bbd7141b6f00fc77caaed": "An image of the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way has been captured, giving the first direct glimpse of the 'gentle giant' at the centre of our galaxy. The black hole itself, known as Sagittarius A*, cannot be seen because no light or matter can escape its gravitational grip. But its shadow is traced out by a glowing, fuzzy ring of light and matter that is swirling on the precipice at close to the speed of light. The image was captured by the Event Horizon telescope (EHT), a network of eight radio telescopes spanning locations from Antarctica to Spain and Chile, which produced the first image of a black hole in a galaxy called Messier 87 in 2019. Prof Sera Markoff, an astrophysicist at the University of Amsterdam and co-chair of the EHT Science Council, said: 'The Milky Way's black hole was our main target, it's our closest supermassive black hole and it's the reason we set out to do this thing in the first place. It's been a 100-year search for these things and so, scientifically, it's a huge deal.' The image provides compelling proof that there is a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, which had been the working assumption of mainstream astronomy. A minority of scientists had continued to speculate about the possibility of other exotic objects, such as boson stars or clumps of dark matter. 'I'm personally happy about the fact it really drills home the fact that there is definitely a black hole at the centre of our galaxy,' said Dr Ziri Younsi, a member of the EHT collaboration based at University College London. To the untrained eye, the latest image might appear roughly similar to that of the black hole, M87*, but the two objects are extremely different, according to the EHT team. Sagittarius A* is consuming only a trickle of material, in contrast to the typical depiction of black holes as violent, ravenous monsters of the cosmos. 'If SgrA* were a person, it would only consume a single grain of rice every million years,' said Michael Johnson of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. M87*, by contrast, is one of the largest black holes in the universe and features vast, powerful jets that launch light and matter from its poles into intergalactic space. 'Sgr A* is giving us a view into the much more standard state of black holes: quiet and quiescent,' said Johnson. '[It] is exciting because it's common.' The latest observations also appear to show that our black hole's angle of rotation is not neatly aligned with the galactic plane, but is off-kilter by about 30 degrees, and hint at spectacular magnetic activity similar to that seen in the sun's atmosphere. Beyond the science, astronomers acknowledged an emotional connection with finally seeing the enigmatic object about which our home galaxy revolves. 'It's another doughnut, but it's our doughnut,' said Younsi. Despite being local in astronomical terms at 26,000 light years away, observing SgrA* turned out to be more challenging than anticipated. The team spent five years analysing data acquired during fortuitously clear skies across several continents in April 2017. Sagittarius A* is relatively small, meaning that the dust and gas in its accretion disc orbit in a matter of minutes rather than weeks, creating a moving target from one observation to the next. Markoff compared the observations with trying to photograph a puppy chasing its tail using a camera with a slow shutter speed. Scientists also had to peer through the galactic plane and filter out intervening stars and dust clouds from their images. Some combination of these factors - and possibly some extreme black hole phenomenon - explain the bright blobs in the image. 'We didn't anticipate how evasive and elusive it would be,' said Younsi. 'It was really a tough picture to take. It's hard to overstate that.' The EHT picks up radiation emitted by particles within the accretion disc that are heated to billions of degrees as they orbit the black hole before plunging into the central vortex. The blotchy halo in the image shows light bent by the powerful gravity of the black hole, which is 4m times more massive than that of our sun. Ultimately, scientists hope that observing a range of black holes - fairly dormant ones like our own and turbulent giants like M87* - could help answer a chicken-and-egg style question about the evolution of galaxies. 'It's an open question in galactic formation and evolution. We don't know which came first, the galaxy or black hole,' said Prof Carole Mundell, an astrophysicist at the University of Bath who is not part of the EHT collaboration. 'From the technology perspective it's mind-blowing that we can do this,' she said of the latest images. The EHT team's results are published on Thursday in a special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters.

In the tangle of streets near exit 3 of Seoul's Dongmyo station, hundreds of vendors sell everything from old Instamatic cameras to books, bags and vinyl records. Located in the South Korean capital's historic district of Dongdaemun, Dongmyo's bustling flea market is scattered around a shrine built in honour of an ancient Chinese military commander. But there is more to the neighbourhood than bargains, vintage clothes, and retro treasures. It also serves as a cultural hub for the city's senior citizens to shop, socialise and show off their unique style. 'One day, I noticed a senior gentleman looking for clothes just like me. His style blew me away,' recalls Seoul-based photographer Kim Dong-hyun, 29, who spends his days documenting the city's vibrant senior street fashion scene, much of which he shares on Instagram. Over the years, Dongmyo has undergone a lot of change, becoming a destination for young people's newfound appreciation of vintage clothing on a budget. At its core though, Dongmyo has always been a playground for the city's elderly population. 'I've met some people who have been going there every week for 30 years,' Kim says, based on the many conversations he has had with the people he has photographed. South Korea is a rapidly ageing society. By 2050, the number of elderly people could account for nearly 44% of the country's population. While many senior citizens feel healthier than ever and do not regard themselves as old, elderly loneliness is a significant problem. 'In Korea, there aren't many places where elderly people can go and have fun. But in Dongmyo, they can go shopping, they can play, meet friends and drink makgeolli  [rice wine]. It's their area, and they don't need to care about what other people think.' 'From their hairdos to their glasses and shoes, they know how to look good and take care of themselves. They pursue their own styles and unique ways to express their individuality. Many of us believe that trendy people are just young people, a message further amplified by the media. But fashion has no age,' he says. Among the senior citizens that hang out in Dongdaemun is Lee Seok-ki, one member of a group known as the 'military crew'. The group is comprised of three men whose styles are different from each other: Lee prefers a minimalist traditional military look, while his friends like to reinterpret military style in a modern way, decorating clothes with colourful embroidered patches and badges.  If anything, senior fashion is more refined, Kim says. 'It's like wine. In your 20s, you just taste everything, but by your 70s, your taste is sharper - you know what you like.' As a child, Chae Myung-hee, 74, developed a passion for fashion that led her to work as a women's clothes designer for 40 years. Even during the pandemic when some people dressed down and avoided makeup, she says she made an effort to always look great, whether she was wearing a mask or not. 'It's always been a part of me,' Chae says. In his upcoming book, Mut - Street Fashion of Seoul, Kim provides a glimpse into the world of senior fashion. He hopes the book will provide a new perspective on a demographic that is often overlooked or under-appreciated. Kim says older people should be recognised for their cool and flair, which is known as meot in Korean, or as Kim likes to stylise it online and in his book - mut. 'It's more than the English word 'cool',' he says. 'Sometimes it can mean something is wonderful, sometimes it can mean nice, sometimes it's gorgeous or fabulous. I can't express it differently or translate the word, and don't see the need for it.' The images offer hope, he says, and a new way of looking at ageing. 'I think some people have hope when they see my pictures. They can see that they too can continue to be fashionable when they grow older. 'When a headline uses the word 'grandfather', we automatically assume something negative ... I want to show that seniors have individual personalities, that they too can have their own meot.'", "3ef73963cc5c910272055fa814d1dc78173efa52fdff63e6418fffa4": "", "dcd9c9587927593b348966017a19ea1300009ddf684b185d10bb8b34": "How do you become the richest man in the world? In Elon Musk's case, part of it involves making workers in China put in hours that would be unacceptable according to labor norms elsewhere. On Tuesday, the Tesla boss praised Chinese factory workers for pulling extreme hours while taking a shot at American workers. 'There is just a lot of super talented hardworking people in China who strongly believe in manufacturing,' the billionaire said. 'They won't just be burning the midnight oil, they will be burning the 3am oil, they won't even leave the factory type of thing, whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all.' Musk's comment comes as Tesla's massive Shanghai 'Giga-factory' pushes its workers to the limit to meet production targets amid an ongoing pandemic lockdown. In April, Tesla restricted its Shanghai workers from leaving the factory under a so-called 'closed-loop' system originally developed by Chinese authorities to contain Beijing Olympics participants. While locked inside, the workers were reportedly made to work 12-hour shifts, six days in a row, and to sleep on factory floors. Production at the plant was forced to halt this week due to parts shortages, the company said. Labor rights and safety violations have been reported at Tesla's Shanghai factory since it opened in 2018, with some workers making as little as $1,500 a month in what an investigation by local journalists called the 'Giga-sweatshop.' Even in the United States, Musk is well known for his disregard for labor norms and work-life balance: the tech billionaire infamously declared 'nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week'. He has bragged about making Tesla's US employees work 100-hour weeks, while claiming to have worked 120-hour weeks himself. In March, Musk called an all-hands meeting for his other company, SpaceX, at 1am. These practices are on par with China's extreme work culture, nicknamed '996', in which workers are expected to work from 9am to 9pm, six days a week. The practice has been the source of protests in recent years and has been characterized as a form of modern slavery. Eli Friedman, a China labor expert and associate professor of international and comparative labor at Cornell University's ILR School, said Musk's remark should be understood in the 'broader context of American corporations taking advantage not just of the low cost of labor in China, but the flexibility'. For bosses like Musk, 'that's the comparative advantage: the fact that you have hundreds of thousands of workers that you can literally wake up in the middle of the night and put them on the production line,' Friedman said. 'It's tapping into a kind of Orientalist narrative about these kind of robotic Chinese workers who, [Musk] says in a sort of valorized way, that this is a good thing,' the researcher added. Officially, Chinese labor law mandates a 40-hour work week, with employees allowed up to 36 hours of overtime a month - which would come out to just over a 48-hour work week. But that's not what happens in practice. 'There's no pretence anywhere that that's enforced,' said Friedman. 'Excessive overtime is kind of a built-in feature of the whole model of industrial development in China. Very long hours and compulsory overtime, while not legal, are also completely the norm. And this is done regularly in consultation with local governments who are also tasked with enforcing the labor law.' Employees in China are often asked to sign a 'striver's pledge' which waives their right to overtime pay and paid time off. And while many corporations in China have unions, the unions are funded by the employer, which makes them essentially powerless to negotiate against management, Friedman noted. Tesla did not respond to questions about its factory's work hours and policies. China's gruelling culture of extreme hours has been celebrated by tech billionaires in the country, including Alibaba's Jack Ma, who has called the '996' system a 'huge blessing', and rival company JD.com's Richard Liu, who has called workers who work fewer hours 'slackers'. In recent years, a growing movement of Chinese workers has stood up to oppose overwork, with some activists using tools like GitHub to compile lists of Chinese companies accused of violating labor laws. Anger over the country's extreme work culture intensified last January after a 22-year-old worker for Shanghai-based e-commerce firm Pinduoduo collapsed and died after leaving work at 1.30am, after a run of brutally long shifts. Incidents like these helped drive a trend among young Chinese social media users early last year promoting 'tang ping', or 'lying flat' on the ground as a passive protest against work, which has since been restricted on the Chinese internet. Later in the year, China's top court ruled that forced and excessive overtime was illegal, but the ruling has not been well enforced. Work stoppages, often unofficial 'wildcat' strikes, continue to occur regularly in China. Chinese and American labor norms have clashed in recent years, as bosses pit teams against each other. The 2019 Netflix documentary 'American Factory' described the conflicts that arose after a Chinese billionaire, Cao Dewang, opened a factory in an abandoned General Motors plant in Ohio. 'American workers are not efficient, and output is low,' Cao complained at one point in the film. 'I can't manage them.' Last week, the Wall Street Journal revealed that some of the US-based employees at Chinese-owned TikTok were expected to pull back-to-back all-nighters and spend as many as 85 hours a week in meetings to keep up with their Chinese colleagues. In the United States, employees covered by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act must receive overtime pay for working more than 40 hours a week. But the law places no cap on the number of hours an employee can work. The grim backdrop to Musk's comments is that 'American workers are in a very subjugated position as well, unfortunately', said Friedman. 'The not-at-all subtle threat is that these Chinese workers are a threat to you white American workers. If you don't meet that standard, then your jobs are on the line.'", "81d82bd61f9617f798e864cbff4cbc800bc00516950b9b6267893850": "", "abb40171078a3dad4e95b3c4f417e7daf3e9aa2c80f3b289202f025d": "", "ab2492f172a287482559fdba3c48e1d90ea17453a852ff7f6d03e7a0": "When Laurie Bertram Roberts was 17, she was sent home from hospital and almost bled to death. Pregnant and experiencing bleeding, she had gone to the emergency department of her nearest hospital in Indiana twice, and was told she was miscarrying, but, because a scan showed the foetus still had a heartbeat, she was also told there was nothing they could do. What she needed, in order to end a pregnancy that was ending anyway, was an abortion - but she says the Catholic hospital would not provide one. 'They had the power to end my pregnancy right there, when I was already bleeding fairly heavily, in a tremendous amount of pain. Instead, they sent my scared 17-year-old self, a mother of two already, home.' There Bertram Roberts collapsed. She closes her eyes, visualising the scene. 'I remember what it feels like to think you're dying. Laying on the floor, in my mom's kitchen, I passed out.' She was taken to hospital to have the emergency procedure that she could have had earlier. She had twins already, having got pregnant and married at 16 (though the marriage didn't last). By the time she was 25, Bertram Roberts, now 44, had seven children. She had wanted to terminate one of these pregnancies - her health was suffering so soon after her previous birth, and she was a single parent living in poverty. It seemed impossible to have another baby, but when she arrived at the clinic, she found she couldn't afford the abortion. 'I got turned away, and then I ended up being too far along. The trauma of that, even though I love my child ... I came to terms with having to stay pregnant, but not everybody does. I was fortunate - I had my mom and my grandmother to help me. That's the only reason I made it through. I can't imagine what it would have been like if I didn't have that.' Both these events - needing or wanting an abortion, but not being able to have one - crystallised Bertram Roberts's belief in reproductive rights, and set her on a course as an activist. Bertram Roberts, who identifies as a non-binary femme, is executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund, an organisation based in Alabama that provides abortion care and campaigns for reproductive justice. When we speak over Zoom, Bertram Roberts - warm, funny, just the person you'd want to get you out of a difficult situation - is at home in Tuscaloosa, with a Wonder Woman poster just behind her. The previous organisation she founded and is still involved with, the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund (MRFF), is now run by two of her daughters. Since the draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade, which had established a legal right to abortion, was leaked, Bertram Roberts says: 'I haven't been able to sleep, but before this, I was having trouble sleeping.' In the states she has lived and worked in, abortion access has always been fragile, and increasingly limited. Mississippi has a 'trigger law', which means that abortion will be banned if, as looks likely, Roe v Wade is overturned. It will almost certainly become illegal in Alabama, too, as well as neighbouring states, meaning options for women - even if they could afford to travel - will become extremely limited. It will disproportionately affect women of colour, who accounted for nearly 67% of abortions in Alabama in 2019, and those living below the poverty level, who will be more likely to self-manage abortion with pills at the risk of being caught, 'and criminalisation is going to disproportionately fall on black and brown bodies, because it always does.' Forced birth, says Bertram Roberts, 'is going to kill people. You can't force people to stay pregnant and then not expect that people are going to die, when it's more risky to give birth than to have an abortion. And that's just in general, that's not even specific to black women.' Yellowhammer and MRFF have provided women with money to pay for not only the abortion itself (since 2020, Yellowhammer has had its own clinic, but both funds enable women to access clinics across state lines), but transport, childcare costs, and food. Bertram Roberts sees reproductive justice as all-encompassing - not just providing access to abortion and contraception, but supporting families to look after the children they already have. 'We're also doing work around self-managed abortion, making sure people know how to safely use pills.' Bertram Roberts was raised a fundamentalist Christian and grew up believing abortion was evil. As a child, she would go on 'plenty of anti-choice events. I got told that I was a survivor of the 'post-Roe holocaust'.' A grim smile. 'And they would specifically say to me I should be very grateful that my white mother decided to have me because she was pregnant with a black man's baby.' Then, she says, 'life happened, and I became a teenage mom and wife. I got pregnant again and again and again, and you just learned that no issue is as black and white as anti-abortion activists try to make it seem.' She has always been an activist - when she was about 11, she started a petition at school to get a janitor, who had been bullying children, fired. In her 20s, she went to a community college, and excelled, despite having her last two children during her time there. At 27, she got a scholarship to Jackson State University in Mississippi, leaving her children with her mother while she studied for a political science degree. She would call them every evening, and spend every night marking their homework. In her third year, they were allowed to come and live with her on campus. University - where she embraced racial justice and feminist campaigning - politicised her. As an older student, and mother of seven, young students sought her out if they were pregnant and wanted an abortion. 'When folks needed to figure out how to get to a clinic or how to get the money, I was kind of that person.' She was also part of a group fighting to get the university to take the domestic violence she had witnessed on campus seriously (before university, she had survived domestic abuse). During this time, a fellow student, Latasha Norman, was killed by her boyfriend. 'We could have been doing actual preventative work,' says Bertram Roberts. 'One of the lessons that I learned from that is that we help us. It's good to work on policy and within the system, but at the same time, we got us. That really influenced the work I do now.' She became more involved in abortion rights around the time Mississippi was considering the 'personhood amendment', which, had it passed, would have defined life as the moment of conception, but was rejected by voters. Involved with the local branch of the National Organization for Women (NOW), she was the only person who would go on television to talk about the incendiary issue of abortion. 'A lot of people had jobs to lose,' she says. Bertram Roberts was unable to work because of chronic health problems. 'You can't fire me from being disabled,' she says with a laugh. 'What are you going to do? Fire me from being a caretaker to my kids?' Funny and forceful, she is a natural communicator, and didn't go in for euphemisms such as 'reproductive health'. 'Abortion! Say the word, otherwise a lot of times people don't even know what you're talking about. So that became my job. I became the abortion lady of Mississippi.' By 2013, she was escorting women to clinics. What was that like? She pauses. 'I won't say I wasn't ready, because I knew what they [the anti-abortion protesters outside clinics] were going to be like, but I don't think I expected them to be so personal. It was like they did research on me - they knew how many kids I had, they knew when I had them.' Her teenage daughters would go with her and Bertram Roberts remembers protesters calling them 'jezebels'. 'Like, who does that?' she says. 'They would come up to [my daughter] and be like, 'how many abortions have you had to be so eager to kill black children?'' Bertram Roberts wasn't, she says with a wry smile, 'ready for them to lecture me about black history. The audacity of these white people!' They would tell her that one day she would be on trial 'just like Nazis. 'OK, thank you, people who think The Handmaid's Tale is a fanfic. Please get the fuck out of my way.'' She gets abusive emails now, including one this week that ended by saying her mother should have aborted her. She laughs and says, 'there's nothing like being so anti-abortion that you think I should be aborted.' Bertram Roberts was meeting women who were sometimes a few dollars short, sometimes more, who couldn't pay for their abortion, and so she would scramble to raise money. At first funding came through NOW, then in 2015 she established MRFF as a separate organisation. 'It really came out of seeing people who didn't have a taxi fare, who came hungry. The need is so great.' Sometimes accessing abortion would mean travelling for hours, and women would tell Bertram Roberts they had food for the trip, 'but really, what they mean is they're going to buy a box of cereal on their food stamps'. The reputation of MRFF grew; at one point, she says, it was getting 100 calls a week. 'There's just no way to get back to that many people, and we were out of money.' It had to close down for a few months to cope with the backlog. Now the MRFF gets about 20 calls a week, 'and we're able to help about half of those'. (Yellowhammer receives 50 to 60 calls a week.) The majority of women who access the services, she says, 'are low-income or working class and already have kids. They understand the decision that they're making. And some folks just don't want to have kids.' They have included women whose sterilisation surgery has failed. 'People who were using contraception and it failed, people who had their contraception sabotaged, young people who are preyed upon or assaulted, grandmas who thought they were in menopause. People who get abortions are the people you know. That's what I've learned doing abortion care.' Abortion, she says, is simply part of wider reproductive healthcare. 'You never know when a pregnancy that is going as planned will turn into a pregnancy where you need abortion care. The bravado that some people have to think, 'It could never be me ...' I didn't choose to need an abortion at 17. I was a fully pro-life, never-have-an-abortion person and then almost died because no one would give me one.' Ultimately, she says, nobody should have to feel like a choice was made for them. 'You should have support whether you choose to parent, or have an abortion.' She smiles, clearly frustrated by the fight but ready for it. 'I don't see what the issue is. What is so hard about this?'", "313b89697ecf4ebe29dacc3fc14668336b1b6275bf7986436b272463": "", "0baba6ebd480897cd838cda23476c68006d3c07952c74c8347a39a19": "", "77a6c4f52f42d6c093b347c4207d39b2cb3d3cad122d761c30fa2e30": "", "bed66d8b1f0214ad6eca18eff1e9f00b72a38565849ef8faa67b6d7c": "", "8a6dbd7204b8401b6ae7c902b29ede3467532d836244d93b206bbf3d": "", "5db1afd1a13a90405550ca20e453a45dfc64774a63421f472c5b9db0": "", "ebe67b7596e17ae07977ff71ca8fca8be410bac6fb52e922da542269": "", "a661072e0351f8830dc96cf894e50a94d1133e359e3d46c2bcb11cdb": "", "9631197de113b56f548456ddc230a92aa4ab89b5a62b12ca424c3362": "", "aac678e2067f51aeb50e9a7ba748a4d4bfc1b7d4570f4a12a1058459": "", "d65481d8586c0d0d75efcbbba06be79b1adb2e5013686f33ab8683a7": "", "bc93b568223be683515fef8895bad47f3292885e92b2c4cad35f5849": "", "c1504404bab7284cbcaf40677015c97953c094f2e002670ee1651b11": "", "0133f4227c7473cc3eaf9fef3cc4b41fb40cc31aebc91d59b7d9f9e2": "The departure of Sri Lanka's prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, follows weeks of protest and a deepening crisis. There is no bankruptcy system for states but if there was then the south Asian country - down to its last $50m (PS40m) of reserves - would be first in line to use it. A team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week started work with officials in Colombo over a bailout that will include a tough package of reforms as well as financial support. But as the IMF and its sister organisation, the World Bank, know full well, this is about more than the mismanagement of an individual country. They fear Sri Lanka is the canary in the coalmine. Across the world, low- and middle-income countries are struggling with a three-pronged crisis: the pandemic, the rising cost of their debt, and the increase in food and fuel prices caused by Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. David Malpass, the World Bank's president, explained his concerns at the organisation's spring meeting last month. 'I'm deeply concerned about developing countries,' Malpass said. 'They are facing sudden price increases for energy, fertiliser and food, and the likelihood of interest rate increases. Each one hits them hard.' The UN has sought to quantify the problem. Its trade and development arm, UNCTAD, said in a recent report that there were 107 countries facing at least one of three shocks: rising food prices, rising energy prices or tighter financial conditions. All three shocks were being faced by 69 countries - 25 in Africa, 25 in Asia and the Pacific, and 19 in Latin America and the Pacific. The list of countries that look vulnerable is long and varied. The IMF has opened rescue talks with Egypt and Tunisia - both big wheat importers from Russia and Ukraine - and with Pakistan, which has imposed power cuts because of the high cost of imported energy. Sub-Saharan African countries being carefully watched include Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Ethiopia. Argentina recently signed a $45bn debt deal with the IMF, but other Latin American countries at risk include El Salvador and Peru. For months there has been speculation that Turkey would be the first domino to fall, but despite an annual inflation rate of 70% and an unconventional approach to economic management, it is still standing. Unlike some other countries under threat, Turkey is able to feed its own people. Richard Kozul-Wright, director of the globalisation and development strategies division at UNCTAD, said: 'Countries have domestic problems but most of the shocks have nothing to do with those. The pandemic and the war had nothing to do with these countries, but have led to a huge increase in borrowing.' The World Bank said almost 60% of the lowest-income countries were in debt distress or at high risk of it before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while the cost of servicing borrowing is rising steeply, particularly for those countries that have amassed debts in foreign currencies. The war in Ukraine has led to investors seeking out the haven of the US dollar, pushing down the value of emerging market currencies. Higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve, America's central bank, have compounded the problem. Emerging market crises are nothing new, but Kozul-Wright said the international community was ill-prepared to deal with a looming debt problem. 'The system can only deal with these problems country by country,' he said. 'But these are systemic issues and currently there is no way of dealing with them systemically.' That may prove costly. Sri Lanka is the first country to buckle under the mounting economic pressures triggered by the war in Ukraine. It is unlikely to be the last.", "15a9016e3a74536db6f52abbb71752cc0bcb1b9391eda4c20ff71a99": "Two presidents and two speeches for Victory Day: from Vladimir Putin in Moscow and Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. Both presidents talked more about the present day than the past. Both insisted their enemies today were the heirs of the Nazis, and both promised their countries would succeed in what they both said was a defensive war they had been forced to fight. There, however, the similarities between the two addresses by Putin and Zelenskiy came to an end. The first difference was stylistic: Putin was surrounded by the pomp and militarism of the annual Red Square parade, riffing on a topic he has been angry about for years. Zelenskiy, strolling along Kyiv's main street and delivering a casual but impassioned speech straight into the camera, cut a very different figure, as he has since the start of the war. But the main difference was that for most people existing beyond the reach of Russian state television, Zelenskiy's arguments were likely to be a lot more convincing than Putin's. Putin has long used his 9 May speeches to draw parallels between the second world war and the present day, and this year's speech was nothing new, simply a compilation of previous grievances that were recycled and intensified for this year, when his army is fighting a new war. But the images from that war, seen across the world, have made Putin's politicisation of the Soviet wartime sacrifice even less convincing. Putin used the Victory Day podium to reel off a list of grievances against the west that seemed to describe his own regime more aptly. He made reference to 'cancel culture', complaining that so-called 'traditional values' had been cancelled, despite the fact his regime has arrested people for Facebook posts and shut down numerous newspapers for calling the war in Ukraine a war, and not a 'special military operation', the officially approved euphemism. The west was 'rewriting history', Putin complained, ignoring the fact that his regime has done more than any in Europe to quash free historical inquiry about the war years. In modern Russia, the Soviet war effort is seen as sacred, immaculate and not to be sullied by historical inquiry or archival research that might shed light on some of its darker moments. The Russian army was fighting in Ukraine 'so that there is no place in the world for butchers, murderers and Nazis', said Putin, a particularly grim claim given the well-documented evidence of executions, rape, looting and desecration carried out by his troops. For some years, Putin has hinted at comparisons between the modern-day US and the Nazis, bemoaning American hegemony and the 'unipolar world' that followed the Soviet collapse. Back in 2015, Putin used his Victory Day speech to say that 'in the 1930s, enlightened Europe failed immediately to see the deathly threat of Nazi ideology ... Seventy years later, history calls on us to be aware and alert once again. We have seen an effort to create a unipolar world, and we are seeing force-oriented thinking gain traction.' This year Putin made the comparison more explicitly. 'The United States, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, began to talk about its exclusivity, humiliating the whole world,' he said. Over the years, Putin's disquiet about American hegemony has resonated with many different political currents globally and is at the core of why some have admired the Russian president. This year, however, the invasion of Ukraine and occupation of parts of it has made Putin's message harder to stomach, even for many of his fans. One of the telegrams Putin sent on the occasion of Victory Day was a message to the people of Ukraine, wishing them 'good health, success and a long life'. Soon after the speech, air raid sirens sounded again in Kyiv.", "1ec255e7e5b4d62abb33fedb72dd1eadd4a9a86662cf36e208829fad": "The ancient Greek city of Paestum, on Italy's south-west coast, is hardly discreet - its temples are glaringly obvious for all to see. Yet it was only 'rediscovered' in the mid-18th century thanks to the grand tour, when the sons of aristocrats from across Europe, though mostly Britain, visited southern European cultural sites as part of their education. Now its majestic temples have a new guardian - a 38-year-old from Milan. Tiziana D'Angelo is one of the youngest people to direct a big Italian cultural site and is among the few female directors.  'You would expect a very serious and composed reaction but the first thing I did was scream,' she said on being told she had got the job. 'Then came tears of joy.' The first time she set eyes on Paestum, famous for its three Doric temples, dating from about 600 to 450BC, was as a child when visiting the site with her family. Her studies brought her back in 2012 to conduct research on the funerary paintings that adorned hundreds of tombs, dating from the Greek to the Lucanian and Roman eras. These were excavated in Paestum and necropolises in the surrounding area, and she studied them as part of her doctorate at Harvard University. 'I returned periodically and collaborated with Gabriel Zuchtriegel [the former director] on exhibitions, and so I maintained a relationship with the site,' said D'Angelo, who has also studied at Oxford and Cambridge, and until a few weeks ago was an assistant professor at Nottingham University. 'But never would I have imagined that one day I would come back here as director. It's a dream.' Paestum, located in the Cilento area of Italy's Campania region, is often overshadowed by the more popular Pompeii and Herculaneum. Even more low-profile is nearby Velia, where the Greek philosopher Parmenides was born, which along with Paestum formed part of Magna Graecia, the name of the southern Italian coastal areas colonised by the Greeks. The management of the two sites was merged in early 2020. Founded in about 600BC, Paestum was originally called Poseidonia, from Poseidon, or Neptune, the god of the sea, to whom the city was dedicated. It was later conquered by the Lucanians and then the Romans, although D'Angelo said the transitions were gradual. 'You have to think that these people coexisted. They negotiated space and power, and there is archaeological evidence of this: for example, the funerary paintings allow you to reconstruct this much more complex context,' she added. Paestum's walls and amphitheatre remain mostly intact, but it was only in the second half of the 20th century, when excavations began in earnest, that hundreds of painted graves were found in and around the area, including the Tomb of the Diver - the only one dating back to the Greek period. Discovered in a small cemetery in the late 1960s by the noted archaeologist Mario Napoli, its huge grave ledger depicts a naked man diving into the sea, said to be a metaphor of the transition from life to death. Other slabs from the tomb depict scenes of a banquet and homosexual love. The tomb is among those housed at Paestum's museum, and about 400 are currently held in a warehouse that D'Angelo plans to periodically open to the public. The majority date to the Lucanian period. 'You might think these paintings were just a commemoration of the dead, but they were part of the funerary process, as they were actually painted during the ceremony,' she said. Other treasures found at Paestum include various pottery, weapons and ancient Greek homes. Over in Velia, founded by Phocaean Greek colonists who made their way to southern Italy after their victory in a sixth-century naval battle over the Etruscans and their Carthaginian allies off the coast of Corsica, the most recent discovery was two warrior helmets believed to have originated from the battle, one taken from the enemy. Also found were vases and the remains of a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena. 'They built temples that contained Greek weapons but we also found evidence of Etruscan weapons, which tells us they also dedicated the weapons of their enemies to Athena,' said D'Angelo. She plans to consolidate the two parks, including establishing a bus link between them. In Velia, work is under way to make a former railway tunnel, currently serving as a warehouse for the site's treasures, accessible to the public. A museum is planned at Velia, while more space will open at Paestum's museum this year. The Easter weekend was D'Angelo's first as director, and there was a record number of visitors, a sign that she could be in for a busy time. 'I am grateful to all who made this opportunity possible, not only the director general who chose me, but my parents and the teachers at high school who made me passionate about the ancient world and art, and my supervisors and colleagues at the various museums I worked at,' she said.", "97a4cbca800d40961599aeb3245bbf09b1620034bdc420739f854ef6": "As a volunteer working alongside the Red army as they fought their bloody battles against Nazi Germany in Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, Livdmyla Lishtvanonva, 99, would pick up unexploded shells and ammunition with her bare hands to help clear the streets for the fighting men and women. 'Even off the roofs of buildings,' she recalls with a smile. 'We were fighting for our land.' Kharkiv, eight decades ago, as it is today, was the location for fierce battles in which many lives were lost and Lishtvanonva says that she and her mother, a nurse, had to leave their home city for a village on its outskirts after their apartment was destroyed in a bombing raid. Lishtvanonva laments that the last two months, particularly the sounds and sights of shelling, have brought such memories flooding back. This weekend, as Ukraine quietly marked a day of remembrance and reconciliation and Russia prepared for a more raucous Victory Day to commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany, those reflections are all the more poignant. But there are new memories now. From the window of her sparsely decorated room in the Kyiv nursing home in Chaiky village, on the western outskirts of Ukraine's capital, near the now infamous and devastated towns of Irpin and Bucha, Lishtvanonva watched just a few weeks ago as a neighbouring business centre went up in flames after being hit by a missile. Like the other 160 residents at the home, she spent days in its dusty and dark basement at the height of the battle and later had to be evacuated to the city centre when Russian soldiers on 8 March climbed over a perimeter fence to launch their drones from its leafy grounds. 'We had a problem with rubbish as it wasn't being collected so I was digging a big hole in the ground to put it all in when suddenly I saw Russians climbing over the fence', recalls Evhen Kryvtsov, 38, the director of the institution. 'I was in a big hole with a shovel. I thought my time might be up.' Thanks to the Ukrainian defence of Kyiv, the Russian stay at the home turned out to be brief, and Ukraine's victory in battle allowed everyone to return three weeks ago. Tetiana Rudyk, 42, the home's deputy director, laughs as she admits that the staff had checked behind every curtain and in every room for hiding Russian soldiers. But there is deep grief felt by the three women living here who are old enough to have memories of the war with Germany. Lishtvanonva, who lives in room 407, says she has always thought of herself as Russian and 'won't pick a side'. 'It is like any other war - it is two political parties fighting because someone wants to be noticed,' she says. But Lishtvanonva adds: 'We were fighting for peace [in the second world war]. I just want peace. Building is a lot more difficult than destroying.' Maria Lebid, 94, in room 406, who picked up a gun for the Red army is too ill to talk at any length, but cries when the war is raised, as does Valentyna Lits, 94, in room 444, who says she cannot understand how such brutal conflict has again come to the country - and via Russia of all places. Lits' father, Pavel, was in the artillery corps in the Red army during the fighting around Kyiv in the 1940s and she remembers a letter he wrote in which he spoke of being ordered to shell an area in which Russians soldiers were in close combat with the Germans. 'He said that he didn't know if his own people had survived,' Lits says. She has two grandsons in Russia in their 40s. They don't talk about the conflict with her when they call, she says, although one of them appears to believe in Putin's 'special military operation'. Yet, Lits' who has interrupted her reading of some old newspaper cuttings about healthy living in order to reminisce and share her thoughts, appears almost embarrassed to admit that what she reads and hears about in the news has filled her with an emotion that had been alien and unthinkable to her until now. 'Throughout my life, I was fine with Russians,' she says, pausing to control her emotions. 'I took some anxiety pills before you came but it isn't working,' she adds, before continuing: 'My husband was from the far east of Russia and his mother didn't want him to marry a Ukrainian but I was fine with Russians. Now, I see and hear what is happening, the murder and rape, the death of children, and I feel hate, I am filled with hate. And I never thought I would hate Russians, never.'", "9ab7f8e0e284ca7ed907ae85b78cbce1201c60464e1f96c1ace610f9": "The world's leading energy economist has warned against investing in large new oil and gas developments, which would have little impact on the current energy crisis and soaring fuel prices but spell devastation to the planet. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), was responding to an investigation in the Guardian that revealed fossil fuel companies were planning huge 'carbon bomb' projects that would drive climate catastrophe. He said countries must seek to replace Russian oil and gas in the near term without damaging their long-term prospects. 'I understand some countries may look at new fossil fuels but they should remember it takes many years to start production,' he said. '[Such projects] are not the solution to our urgent energy security needs and they will lock in fossil fuel use.' Revelations by the Guardian show nearly 200 carbon bomb projects are in planning, or have already started pumping, that will each result in at least 1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over their lifetimes, equivalent to about 18 years of current global emissions. Companies pursuing such developments could end up with uneconomic stranded assets, Birol warned. 'If the world is to succeed in moving to net zero, these projects may fail to recover their upfront development costs,' he said in an interview with the Guaridan. Soaring global energy prices have led governments to seek new sources of fossil fuels. 'I do understand why countries are reacting like this,' he said. 'But there is the issue of the time horizon.' Big new exploratory projects for oil, gas and coal would take years to produce any fuel and could lock in high greenhouse gas emissions for decades, Birol warned. 'The most suitable projects are those with short lead times and quick payback periods, such as expanding production from existing fields,' he said. Using existing sources more efficiently would also help reduce emissions, Birol noted. He said governments must also urgently seek to reduce fossil fuel demand, through home insulation, cutting speed limits, making public transport cheap or free and introducing car-free days in cities. 'If we do not have these voluntary measures, I'm afraid that energy rationing may be on the table,' he said. Birol said unlike in previous oil shocks, such as those of the 1970s, the world now had cheap alternatives available in the form of solar and wind power, which had plummeted in price. This should prompt governments and companies to push harder for renewable energy. 'I believe we have the chance to make this a historic turning point to a cleaner and more secure energy system,' he said. 'This is the first time I have seen such momentum behind the change to clean energy. 'The world does not need to choose between solving the energy crisis and climate crisis, we can do both.' The UN secretary general also called for an end to new fossil fuel projects, warning that climate change posed 'an existential threat to us all - to the whole world'. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Antonio Guterres said: 'Main emitters must drastically cut emissions, starting now. This means accelerating the end of our fossil fuel addiction and speeding up the deployment of clean renewable energy.' The IEA advised almost exactly a year ago that no new gas, oil or coal development could take place from this year onwards if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C. That finding caused shockwaves among governments in the run-up to the UN Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, where leaders agreed to bring forward national plans in line with the 1.5C limit. But many countries, and private sector companies, have ignored the advice, as the Guardian's investigation of fossil fuel projects under development has shown. These carbon bombs would in effect eliminate any hope of staying within the 1.5C threshold. Greg Muttitt, an energy expert at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, said: 'Governments and companies often suffer from a form of cognitive dissonance: while recognising the urgency and severity of the climate threat, they still keep developing new oil, gas and coalfields and mines that will worsen the problem. The policy answer is a simple one: when in a hole, you need to stop digging.' Greenpeace said the Guardian's investigation revealed the 'fossil fuel industry's business model remains a blueprint for climate catastrophe'. 'Investment plans by oil and gas firms will blow us past every assessment of what is safe for the climate, and that's shocking,' said the group's senior climate adviser Charlie Kronick. 'But what's truly shocking is that they are not hiding it. These activities are legal and in fact are encouraged by governments around the world, particularly the ones that have the biggest reserves and the most to lose.' Caroline Lucas, an MP for the UK's Green party, said in response to the Guardian's investigation: 'Governments seem intent on sending us towards our own destruction. How many more times must we tell fossil fuel companies to #keepitintheground?' Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: 'The answer to a global fossil fuel crisis cannot be to double down on fossil fuels. Every country must go further to rapidly accelerate the transition to clean energy. 'That's the right response to the climate crisis, but it's also the right response to the cost of living and energy security crises too - with renewables now by far the cheapest and most secure form of energy. 'Governments around the world should be urgently investing in a green energy sprint to shift decisively off destructive, expensive, and volatile fossil fuels for good.'", "7efcfb5d7501177d1046c28445f337a02a4b505c3546bf238ea1c3c0": "The world's biggest fossil fuel firms are quietly planning scores of 'carbon bomb' oil and gas projects that would drive the climate past internationally agreed temperature limits with catastrophic global impacts, a Guardian investigation shows. The exclusive data shows these firms are in effect placing multibillion-dollar bets against humanity halting global heating. Their huge investments in new fossil fuel production could pay off only if countries fail to rapidly slash carbon emissions, which scientists say is vital.  The oil and gas industry is extremely volatile but extraordinarily profitable, particularly when prices are high, as they are at present. ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron have made almost $2tn in profits in the past three decades, while recent price rises led BP's boss to describe the company as a 'cash machine'. The lure of colossal payouts in the years to come appears to be irresistible to the oil companies, despite the world's climate scientists stating in February that further delay in cutting fossil fuel use would mean missing our last chance 'to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all'. As the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, warned world leaders in April: 'Our addiction to fossil fuels is killing us.' Details of the projects being planned are not easily accessible but an investigation published in the Guardian shows: At the UN's Cop26 climate summit in November, after a quarter-century of annual negotiations that as yet have failed to deliver a fall in global emissions, countries around the world finally included the word 'coal' in their concluding decision. Even this belated mention of the dirtiest fossil fuel was fraught, leaving a 'deeply sorry' Cop president, Alok Sharma, fighting back tears on the podium after India announced a last-minute softening of the need to 'phase out coal' to 'phase down coal'. Nonetheless, the world agreed coal power was history - the question now was how quickly cheaper renewables could replace it, and how fair the transition would be for the small number of developing countries that still relied on it. But there was no mention of oil and gas in the Cop26 final deal, despite these being responsible for almost 60% of fossil fuel emissions. Furthermore, many of the rich countries, such as the US, that dominate international climate diplomacy and positioned themselves as climate leaders at the conference, are big players in new oil and gas projects. But unlike India, they avoided criticism. That lack of scrutiny prompted the Guardian to spend the months since Cop26 piecing together the clearest picture possible of forthcoming oil and gas exploration and production.  The world's scientists agree the planet is in deep trouble. In August, Guterres reacted strongly to a stark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading authority on climate science. '[This report] is a code red for humanity,' he said.  The IPCC states carbon emissions must fall by half by 2030 to preserve the chance of a liveable future, yet they show no sign of declining. Experts have been warning since at least 2011 that most of the world's fossil fuel reserves could not be burned without causing catastrophic global heating. In 2015, a high-profile analysis found that to limit global temperature below 2C, half of known oil reserves and a third of gas had to stay in the ground, along with 80% of coal. Today, the problem is even more acute. A better understanding of the devastating impacts of the climate crisis has led to the internationally agreed limit for global heating being lowered to 1.5C, to cut the risks of extreme heatwaves, droughts, and floods. In May 2021, a report from the International Energy Agency, previously seen as a conservative body, concluded there could be no new oil or gas fields or coalmines if the world was to reach net zero by 2050. More warnings soon followed. An updated scientific analysis found the proportion of fossil fuel reserves that would need to stay in the ground for 1.5C jumped to 60% for oil and gas and 90% for coal, while the UN warned that planned fossil fuel production 'vastly exceeds' the limit needed for 1.5C. In April, shocked by the latest IPCC report that said it was 'now or never' to start slashing emissions, Guterres launched an outspoken attack on companies and governments whose climate actions did not match their words. 'Simply put, they are lying, and the results will be catastrophic,' he said. 'Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness. 'Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.' The reaction to Russia's war in Ukraine has pushed oil and gas prices even higher, further incentivising bets on new fields and infrastructure that would last decades.  The failure of countries to 'build back greener' after the Covid-19 pandemic or the 2008 financial crash was not a good omen, and Guterres said: 'Fossil fuel interests are now cynically using the war in Ukraine to lock in a high-carbon future.' Assessing future oil and gas developments is challenging: the sector is complex and often secretive, public information is scarce and hard to find and assess. But a global team of Guardian environment reporters has worked with leading thinktanks, analysts and academics across the world over the past five months and now we can answer a series of questions that reveal the scale of the sector's plans. First, how much production is due to come from the projects that are likely to start drilling before the end of this crucial decade? Next, where exactly are the biggest projects around the world, the so-called carbon bombs that would explode the climate? We also followed the money: how much is going to be spent on oil and gas that cannot be burned safely, rather than invested in clean energy? And who benefits most from the fossil fuel subsidies that hide the true damage they cause? The answers to these key questions lead to an inescapable conclusion: if the projects go ahead, they will blow the world's rapidly shrinking cap on emissions that must be kept to enable a liveable future - known as the carbon budget. For all the promises made by many oil companies, the data shows they remain committed to their core business despite the consequences. The short-term expansion plans of oil and gas companies, such as ExxonMobil and Gazprom, are colossal. The Guardian's investigation has found that in the next seven or so years, they are likely to start producing oil and gas from projects that would ultimately deliver 192bn barrels, the equivalent of a decade of today's emissions from China. This estimate was provided by analysts at Urgewald, who used data from Rystad Energy, the industry standard source but not publicly available. Their Gogel database includes 887 companies that explore for and produce oil and gas, and covers 97% of short-term expansion plans. The companies have made a final financial commitment to projects that will deliver 116bn barrels, more than half of the 192bn barrel total. They have also invested heavily in the rest, including final development, engineering and operation plans. Such investment makes these projects likely to go ahead, barring drastic government action, Urgewald says. A third of the short-term expansion plans of oil and gas would come from 'unconventional' and riskier sources. These include fracking and ultra-deep offshore drilling, which are inherently more dangerous - as the oil and gas companies drill deeper, the number of spills, injuries and blowouts increase.  The 192bn barrels are split roughly 50:50 between liquids, including crude oil, and gas. Burning this would produce 73bn tonnes of CO2. But methane routinely leaks from gas operations and is a powerful greenhouse gas, trapping 86 times more heat than CO2 over 20 years. Including this impact, at a standard supply-chain leak rate of 2.3%, means the equivalent of 97bn tonnes of CO2 added to the atmosphere and driving us faster towards climate hell. State oil companies lead the Urgewald short-term expansion list, with Qatar Energy, Russia's Gazprom and Saudi Aramco the top three. Half of Gazprom's projected expansion is in the fragile Arctic, though the long-term implications of Russia's war in Ukraine on its fossil fuel plans remain to be seen. The listed oil majors ExxonMobil, Total, Chevron, Shell and BP are all in the top 10. Unconventional and risky oil and gas production accounts for about 70% of the US majors' totals, while the proportion of fracking and ultra-deep water ranges from 30% to 60% for the European companies. 'Most oil and gas companies are just proceeding with business as usual,' Nils Bartsch at Urgewald said. 'Some just do not care. Some do not see their responsibility because governments around the world let them proceed, although of course these governments are often influenced by the industry.' Two-thirds of the 116bn barrels of oil and gas projects companies are financially committed to are in the Middle East, Russia and North America, according to data provided by Rystad Energy. Australia is anticipated to be a big contributor with 3.4bn barrels, more than from the whole of Europe, where fields are relatively depleted. A separate analysis for the Guardian by Urgewald on the average annual investment in oil and gas exploration over the past three years shows that, along with Shell, three large but rarely scrutinised Chinese companies occupy the top four slots: PetroChina, China National Offshore Oil Corporation, and Sinopec. Seven of the top 10 of these explorers are relying on fracking, ultra-deep water Arctic and tar sands developments for more than half of their expansion. Daniel Ribeiro has been fighting plans for a massive offshore pipeline and liquefied natural gas plant in Cabo Delgado province, Mozambique, since it was mooted more than 15 years ago. The scheme, which would lead to a huge increase in carbon emissions in one of the poorest and most climate-vulnerable countries, is backed by more than PS1bn from the UK government and has some of the biggest oil and gas corporations circling, scenting another huge payday. 'It is already creating a massive amount of disruption for the local fishing and subsistence farmers who are being moved off their land,' said Ribeiro, from the local Justica Ambiental campaign group. 'But if it goes ahead and countries like Mozambique are set off on a fossil fuel track, it will be a global disaster. We can forget tackling the climate crisis ... we will all suffer.' Research shared exclusively with the Guardian has identified the Cabo Delgado development as one of 195 carbon bombs, which - unless stopped - will drive catastrophic climate breakdown around the world. The term carbon bomb has been widely used in climate circles for the past decade to describe large fossil fuel projects or other big sources of carbon. The new research sets a specific definition: projects capable of pumping at least 1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions over their lifetimes. Projects identified include the new drilling wells springing up in the Canadian wilderness as part of the vast Montney Play oil and gas development, and the huge North Field gas fields in Qatar - named in the study as the biggest new oil and gas carbon bomb in the world. The study, led by Kjell Kuhne from the University of Leeds in the UK and due to be published in the journal Energy Policy, found that just a few months after many of the world's politicians positioned themselves as climate leaders during the Cop26 conference in Glasgow, they were giving the green light to a massive global expansion of oil and gas production that scientists warn would push civilisation to the brink. Asad Rehman, a leading climate justice activist in the UK who was at the forefront of a global network of indigenous activists and civil society campaigners in Glasgow, accused the US, Canada and Australia of 'rank hypocrisy'. 'These countries are single-handedly undermining efforts to curtail global emissions and ignoring their responsibility to phase out fossil fuels rapidly and justly.' He said it was the poorest and most vulnerable who were suffering. 'Only the colonial mindset of political leaders in rich countries can make the brutal calculation that the interest of fossil fuel giants and their billions in profit is more important than the lives of people who are overwhelmingly black, brown and poor.' Together these projects would produce 646bn tonnes of CO2 emissions, the study says, swallowing the world's entire carbon budget. More than 60% of these schemes are already operating. Kuhne, the director of the Leave it in the Ground Initiative, said in the first instance, the 40% of projects that had not yet started production must be stopped if the world was to avoid sliding ever more quickly towards catastrophe, adding they should be a prominent focus of the global climate protest movement in the months and years ahead. 'The oil and gas industry is continuing to plan these huge projects, even in the face of a burning planet. The ambitious targets of the Paris agreement were apparently not enough to make them question their business case. These carbon bombs are the single biggest indicator that we are not trying hard enough.' The study is based on data from Rystad Energy but, rather than focusing on total barrels, it identifies the mega projects potentially responsible for the biggest emissions. According to the research, the US is the leading source of potential emissions. Its 22 carbon bombs include conventional drilling and fracking, and span the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico to the foothills of the Front Range in Colorado to the Permian basin. Together they have the potential to emit 140bn tonnes of CO2, almost four times more than the entire world emits each year. Saudi Arabia is the second biggest potential emitter after the US, with 107bn tonnes, followed by Russia, Qatar, Iraq, Canada, China and Brazil. Australia, widely condemned by international leaders as a laggard in addressing the climate crisis, ranks 16th.  Robyn Churnside, a Ngarluma elder on the Burrup peninsula in remote north-west Australia, has been fighting fossil fuel and mining developments since the 1970s. She is part of a campaign trying to stop Woodside's US$12bn Scarborough gas project, one of the biggest fossil fuel developments in the country in a decade. Churnside said dissenting Indigenous voices were too often ignored when decisions were made about new oil and gas infrastructure that could lock in emissions for decades and desecrate culturally significant sites, which in some cases had stood for tens of thousands of years. 'It's about time the world listened to First Nations people because we have been here a long, long time,' she said. 'Our spirit in this land will never rest. It needs protection.' Prof Kevin Anderson, from the Tyndall Centre of Climate Research, University of Manchester and Uppsala University, Sweden, said the scale of planned production in the face of all the evidence suggested big oil and its political supporters either did not believe the climate science or thought their extreme wealth could somehow protect them and their children from the devastating consequences. 'Either the scientists have spent 30 years working on this issue and have got it all wrong - the big oil CEOs know better - or, behind a veil of concern, they have complete disregard for the more climate vulnerable communities, typically poor, people of colour and far away from their lives. Equally worrying, they are disinterested in their own children's future.' When BP reported its quarterly earnings in a presentation to financial institutions in February, one analyst said he 'really enjoyed the camaraderie and the positivity that you're generating', before asking about the company's cash position. 'We've given you a lovely little chart,' said Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief financial officer. 'Certainly, it's possible that we're getting more cash than we know what to do with. For now, I'm going to be conservative and manage the company as if it's $40 [a barrel] oil. Anything we could get above that just helps, obviously.' At the time, the oil price exceeded $90; today it is $106.  The oil industry is awash with cash. The money companies have belongs to shareholders, including pension funds, or in the case of national oil companies, to governments and, in theory at least, citizens. But the investment plans of the biggest oil companies are sharply at odds with the goal of halting the climate crisis. Data obtained by the Guardian from the thinktank Carbon Tracker shows a dozen of the world's biggest companies are on track to commit a collective $387m dollars a day of capital expenditure to exploiting oil and gas fields through to 2030. A significant portion of this is for maintaining production at existing projects - some oil and gas will still be needed as the world weans itself off fossil fuels - but the exact amount is not publicly available. Nonetheless, it is clear that at least a quarter of this investment - $103m a day - is for oil and gas that cannot be burned if the worst impacts of the climate crisis are to be avoided, money that could instead be spent ramping up clean energy. Even more worryingly, the companies have developed further project options that might lead them to spend an additional $84m a day that would not even be compatible with a devastating 2.7C of global heating. The world's governments agreed in the Paris climate accord to limit global heating to well below 2C, and pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5C. For the latter, stricter goal, no new oil and gas projects are possible. The Carbon Tracker data, compiled in September, uses a temperature of 1.65C to represent the well below 2C target and finds that 27% of the companies' projected investments are incompatible with this. ExxonMobil has the largest of these climate-busting investment plans at $21m a day through to 2030, followed by Petrobras ($15m), Chevron and ConocoPhillips (both $12m), and Shell ($8m). In terms of the most dangerous investments - those that could help drive temperatures beyond 2.7C - Gazprom accounts for $17m a day of this, ExxonMobil $12m, Shell $11m and PetroChina $9m. If governments act on the scientific advice to rapidly reduce carbon emissions by boosting clean energy and cutting fossil fuel burning, the companies would have to write off these colossal sums as losses, hitting shareholders, pension funds and public finances. If governments do not act, the companies could cash in as the world burns. Overall, the international oil companies are making the biggest bets, with almost 40% of their projected investments incompatible with 1.65C. ExxonMobil is particularly high, at 56%. The national oil company average is 17%, although 56% of Petrobras's planned capital expenditure is incompatible with 1.65C. 'Companies that continue to develop projects based on business-as-usual demand are betting on the failure of policy action on climate and underestimating the disruptive potential of new technologies, such as renewables and battery storage,' said Mike Coffin at Carbon Tracker. 'Such projects are either not needed or they lead to warming well in excess of Paris goals.' A separate recent analysis based on Rystad Energy data from April, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, found that 20 of the world's biggest oil and gas companies remained on course to spend huge sums - $932bn - by the end of 2030 developing new oil and gas fields. Freeing the world from the grip of fossil fuels is made far harder by huge ongoing subsidies for the fuels, making them far cheaper than their true cost when the damage they cause is included - especially air pollution, which kills 7 million people a year. The G20 group of leading economies pledged in 2009 to phase out the subsidies but little has been achieved. Hundreds of billions of dollars in direct financial support is received by the producers and consumers of fossil fuels every year - but they benefit from far larger subsidies by not paying for the harm burning fossil fuels causes. When the damage from the climate crisis and air pollution is accounted for, the fossil fuel subsidies reach $6tn a year, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Guardian analysis shows this is equivalent to $11m a minute globally, $4m a minute in China and more than $1m in the US. Guardian analysis of more detailed IMF data shows drivers in the US, Canada and Australia, along with Saudi Arabia, are the world's biggest beneficiaries of subsidies for road fuels, with some governments under pressure to increase these during the current energy crisis. The per capita subsidy for petrol and diesel across the population of Saudi Arabia was more than $1,000 a year in 2020. In the US, the road fuel subsidy per capita is $644 and about $500 in both Canada and Australia. Japan and Germany also appear in the top 10 of the road fuel analysis, which focused on the 54 large countries with more than 25 million people and that account for 90% of global population and subsidies. The UK per capita subsidy for road fuels was only $10 a year, indicating taxes on petrol and diesel in 2020 were close to the level of the damage burning the fuels causes. The US is also high on the list of the biggest per capita subsidies for all fossil fuels with $2,000 a year, behind only Saudi Arabia ($4,550) and Russia ($3,560). After these countries, only Iran ($1815) is ahead of Australia ($1730) and Canada ($1690). 'Taking the Paris agreement seriously requires a rapid shift away from fossil fuels,' said Simon Black, a climate economist at the IMF. 'Getting fossil fuel prices right will help enormously in accelerating this transition.' The shift from burning oil and gas cannot happen overnight, and a declining amount will still need to be burned during the transition to a net zero emissions global economy in 2050. The question is whether companies and governments are moving fast enough. The Guardian wrote to the oil and gas companies named in its analysis and asked for their response. 'Under the IEA net zero emissions scenario, and all Paris-aligned scenarios, all energy sources remain important through 2050, and oil and natural gas remain essential components of the energy mix,' said a spokesperson for ExxonMobil.  However, the role of oil and gas would be vastly reduced in 2050, and the IEA said: 'Beyond projects already committed as of 2021, there are no new oil and gas fields approved for development [in our net zero scenario].' ExxonMobil planned to invest more than $15bn on initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions over the next six years, the spokesperson said, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels. The company aimed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 but only from its own operations, not the fuels it sold, therefore covering only a small fraction of the emissions from the oil and gas it sells. A spokesperson for Shell cited recent company statements: 'As a result of [our] planned level of capital investment, we expect a gradual decline of about 1-2% a year in total oil production through to 2030, including divestments.' 'By 2025, Shell expects its expenditure on [low and zero-carbon] products and services across its businesses will have increased to around 50% of its total expenditure,' a recent report by the firm states. In 2022, the proportion is expected to be more than 35%. In 2021, 'Shell achieved its annual investment targets in renewables and energy solutions of $2bn-3bn', the report says. ConocoPhillips also cited a recently published net zero emissions plan: 'Our goal is to support an orderly transition that matches supply to demand and focuses on returns on, and of, capital while safely and responsibly delivering affordable energy.'  The document states that profits from oil and gas projects are significantly higher than from investments in renewable energy. ConocoPhillips has allocated $200m in 2022 to reduce emissions from its operations. To reduce emissions from the burning of the fossil fuels it supplies, the company advocates an 'economy-wide price on carbon that would help shift consumer demand from high-carbon to low-carbon energy sources'. 'Petrobras plans its investments considering that the Paris agreement will be successful and global temperature will be kept below 2degC,' a spokesperson for the company said. 'Oil will remain important in the coming decades, even in accelerated transition scenarios.' The spokesperson said the IEA's scenario for 1.65C indicated some investment in upstream projects was needed. 'We are planning for highly resilient assets competitive in scenarios aligned with Paris due to their low production cost and low emissions. Petrobras is following its strategy of maximising the value of its portfolio, [with 99% of the investment on exploration] focusing on deepwater and ultra-deepwater assets.' TotalEnergies pointed to its recent sustainability report, which it said 'showed our stakeholders that we are already on the right track'. The company has a target of a 30% cut in emissions from oil and gas sales by 2030 and to increase the proportion of its energy sales that are renewable from 9% in 2021 to 20% in 2030. Saudi Aramco and Eni responded to the Guardian but declined to comment. The other companies did not respond to the Guardian's request. The Guardian's investigation has provided an answer to the question of how great a danger the plans of oil and gas companies pose to the climate. But there is another set of questions, those for politicians and governments, that will ultimately affect the course of the climate emergency. Will the world's governments act to close the book on the oil companies' giant climate gamble? Will richer countries, historically most responsible for emissions, support a just transition for developing countries on the frontline of the escalating crisis? Would strong, immediate action lead to a financial crash, as billions of dollars are wiped off the value of some of the world's biggest companies? Or will more steady but concerted action wean us off fossil fuels rapidly, close the oil companies' cash machine and lead us into a clean energy future with a liveable climate? Only time will tell. But, unlike oil and gas, time is in very short supply. 'The world is in a race against time,' said Guterres. 'It is time to end fossil fuel subsidies and stop the expansion of oil and gas exploration.' Reflecting on the war in Ukraine, he said: 'Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use. This is madness. Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.'

The marine conservationist calls the vast new oilfields off Guyana's coast a 'blessing' that will earn billions of dollars for one of the poorest countries in the Caribbean, even as she recognises that pulling yet more fossil fuel from the ground will deepen the climate crisis. But Arjoon does have a problem with who is drilling the oil. She has seen firsthand what happens when the US's largest petroleum company descends on a small country bearing the promise of riches.  As ExxonMobil began drilling a vast oilfield offshore two years ago, the Guyanese government called in the Amerindian marine conservationist to help monitor the environmental impact of what is expected to become the company's biggest source of petroleum by 2025, outpacing even its wells sprawled across Texas. Arjoon, who leads the Guyana Marine Conservation Society, was not impressed. In time she grew to believe that Exxon was indifferent to the dangers of an oil spill to the coast and rivers of one of the best preserved parts of the Amazon biome, and of misleading her about its preparations to deal with such a disaster. She found the company's behaviour 'thuggish and disrespectful'.  'I can only judge Exxon by my direct and deeply personal relationship with them so far. They are not an honourable company,' Arjoon says. Suspicion about the oil firm does not stop with environmentalists. Guyanese politicians have accused Exxon of fleecing the country of billions of dollars by bouncing an ill-experienced government into a contract that pays far less than other countries earn from their oil. Then there is the pressing question of the future of the planet. With Guyana increasingly threatened by rising sea levels, Arjoon is conscious of the impact of Exxon opening a huge oilfield at a time when governments are being warned there can be no new oil or gas fields or coalmines if the world is to reach net zero by 2050. Liza-1 project, in the prolific Greater Liza area, was the first stage to begin production, with Liza-2 coming on line this year. The Greater Turbot discovery was announced in 2017, but is still not yet in production. Both areas are identified in research to be published this month into the world's biggest so-called carbon bombs - gigantic fossil fuel projects that would each result in at least 1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions over their lifetimes. Together they would contribute more than 2.1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions over the course of the project, according to the study, which identifies 195 similar oil and gas mega developments around the world. The Center for International Environmental Law has also warned Exxon's drilling and gas flaring 'may turn Guyana from carbon sink to carbon bomb'. Yet for all that, Arjoon is glad to see the oil flowing because right now, she says, Guyana does not have any other way forward. 'As an environmentalist with 35 years of experience in coastal communities through the length and breadth of Guyana, I see extreme poverty. Oil gives us a way out of that.' This drilling bonanza promises to earn Guyana roughly $150bn over the life of the oilfields, estimated at 30 years. For good or ill, that represents a huge change in fortune for a country of 800,000 people, where more than 40% live below the poverty line of $5.50 (PS4.20) a day. 'All of those that have exploited their oil resources to develop their countries should not be telling Guyana 'leave your oil in the ground',' Arjoon says. 'Norway is always used as the best example of a nation that utilises oil, and it is said that they have the best model for natural resources. So why should Guyana be any different? Who is to say that little Guyana, which has been blessed with so much abundant resources including oil, should not take advantage?' Others agree. There is a bittersweet sense that Guyana needs to hurry and get the oil out of the ground if it does not want to miss the fossil fuel party. After years of failed attempts, Exxon made one of the biggest offshore crude discoveries of recent times when it struck oil off Guyana's coast in 2015. Four years later, the then president, David Granger, proclaimed a public holiday, National Petroleum Day, to celebrate the first oil flowing from its wells. 'Guyana's future is brighter with the beginning of first oil,' he said in a speech to the nation. 'The good life for everyone beckons.' The government promised to set up a sovereign wealth fund, similar to Norway's, to transform the country with investments in roads, education and hospitals. Fossil fuel money is also being earmarked to develop renewable energy sources such as solar and hydroelectric for when the oil runs out, an irony not lost on Arjoon and others. There has even been talk of a $5,000 cash handout to every citizen, a small fortune for many Guyanese. Yet the hopes pinned on oil are tempered by Guyana's divisive politics, shaped by tensions between the descendants of enslaved Africans and Indian indentured labourers, and concerns about official corruption. For some Guyanese, their first encounters with Exxon have left them sceptical of the promises. A short drive east of the capital, Georgetown, George Jagmohan used to run seven fishing boats. He might be less angry about selling them off one by one since the oil drilling began if he believed in the declarations of a golden dawn for Guyana. 'Since the drilling started, the fish have gone. It's the blasting and vibrations,' says Jagmohan, sitting on a sea wall next to a clutch of idle boats. 'In another couple of years it will be finished. It never used to happen. People aren't stupid. I've been fishing for 40 years and it's not been like this before.' A few miles further up the coast, Steve Outar says his catches are down by about 80% but he has not laid up any of his four boats because he feels a responsibility to the crews. 'The fish production in neighbouring Suriname and Venezuela is still 100%, so why is it falling here? Because the vibrations are driving the fish and shrimp away. Some of my boats spend 18 days at sea but still don't catch enough fish,' he says as he cleans red snapper ready for processing as dried fish for shipment to China. 'Each boat has a captain and six men. That's 28 crew, and each of the crew has a family to support. If they don't catch, they get nothing. If we're out of business, they are out of bread.' Arjoon says overfishing and other factors have played a part in the decline, but she agrees that 'the massive seismics that were done in the early stages did have an impact on marine life, especially marine mammals. That was when you had an unprecedented amount of strandings of sperm whales.' But she says that when she tried to talk to Exxon about the timings of seismic explosions, to see if they coincided with the stranding of whales, she was fobbed off. And, like others, Arjoon fears not enough has been done in case of a spill that could devastate this coast. 'Exxon's modelling showed an unmitigated spill could impact the north-western part of the Shell beach protected area all the way to the Orinoco delta. What lies in between is a very special place, especially because that is where the largest national repository of blue carbon exists, at a time when our low-carbon development strategy has been expanded,' she says. The government says there is no evidence Exxon is responsible for reduced catches and notes that Guyana's overall fish production has increased by more than 10% from 2020, and exports for the fisheries sector have surpassed GUY$4bn. And Exxon said its 'first priority for every project is to put in place mitigations and processes that help to prevent adverse events by utilising the best technologies, equipment and people in our operations'. 'The Bank of Guyana summarises landing quantities in their annual reports on Guyana's sector economies; according to the data provided in those reports, fluctuations in the quantity of finfish and shrimp landings have been observed for many years. Oil and gas activities have not been included as potential factors.' 'We work diligently to avoid any spills. But should one occur, we are prepared to mitigate and resolve it as quickly and comprehensively as possible,' the company states. But Outar waves away officials' claims, saying that is not the experience of local fishers. And he does not have much faith that the promises made for oil will make up for the decline in fishing. 'Oil isn't going to help. It can make the country rich but the people won't be better off. We've still got to live day to day. We can't eat a new road,' he says. Jahmohan is blunter. 'Are you fucking crazy or what? It will all end up in the politicians' pockets. They'll be sitting there drinking champagne and whisky,' he says. 'They told us oil will make us rich. We've got gold, diamonds, sugar in this country. We should be rich from that but we're not. So why will oil be different?' Those concerns are more widely shared. Frederick Collins, the head of the anti-corruption organisation Transparency International Guyana, warned that oil 'can end up being more of curse than a blessing'. He points to the behaviour of big oil in the Niger delta, where millions of people live with flaring and spills but see few benefits.  Others look to the experience of Equatorial Guinea, which enjoyed an oil bonanza that in less than a decade transformed it from one of the world's poorest countries to the highest per capita income in Africa by 2008. But Human Rights Watch describes Equatorial Guinea's oil wealth as 'squandered and stolen' by the government, resulting in declines in healthcare and access to education. Vincent Adams, the former head of Guyana's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), says that should serve as a warning to Guyana as payments to its oil fund soar to nearly $1bn this year, permitting the government to increase its budget by 44%. 'It's not about the oil, it's about how you govern the country and how you govern the management of the oil industry. Oil is not going to be around for more than maybe 30 years. So the governance part of it is to make sure that we invest now so there will be a sustainable economy after oil is gone to attract foreign direct investment, to lay the groundwork in education, infrastructure, national security, health, agriculture,' he says. 'We are definitely not prepared for it. And the biggest frustration is that the government just does not understand what it takes to be prepared, and what it takes to govern under these circumstances to make the country a better country.' Confidence has also been undercut by the widely held belief that Exxon bounced a government lacking in expertise and desperate for money into a contract that serves the country badly, with the global human rights group Global Witness estimating that Guyana will earn about $50bn less than it would have done under a more common type of agreement. A Guardian/Floodlight investigation last year found grave concern among experts about the contract signed by the Guyanese government. Adams said he warned the government against the contract but it was afraid Exxon would walk away. The deal allows Exxon to deduct up to 75% of the earnings from its Guyanese wells as costs before the balance is split between the government and the company. It recently presented Guyana with a bill of more than $9bn for those costs, which the government admits it does not have the resources to audit. The offices of Guyana's president and natural resources minister did not respond to requests for an interview. According to Exxon, 'the terms of the contracts are competitive with other agreements signed in countries at a similar resource-development phase'. It added: 'Guyana's resources have been brought on line at a record pace for the industry, resulting in significant financial benefits for the government and its industry partners.' The project, after all, is steaming ahead. Guyana's vice-president, Bharrat Jagdeo, played a leading role in developing a low-carbon strategy and protecting the rainforest but is pushing for as much oil as fast as possible, telling a recent conference: 'Because there is this climate change imperative to decarbonise, our policy is to get as much oil out of the ground as quickly as possible. It sounds a bit harsh for those who think you should be environmentally sound, but that is the reality of it.' Arjoon will be watching closely. She calls the gap between Exxon's claims to prioritise environmental protection and the reality a 'disgraceful deficit', adding: 'I am not unaware that Exxon is here to ensure the best returns to their shareholders. 'Exxon is not here because they care about Guyana. But that does not mean they can treat us as an uneducated nation. We don't drink the Kool-Aid so easily.' ", "fcbad06cc1b0dbb9b20cfc4690310d4df18f252d4e582f85aca83b48": "Environmental tipping points are fast approaching in the UK, the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) has said. Potential tipping points - where gradual decline suddenly becomes catastrophic - include loss of wildlife, fisheries collapse and dead, polluted rivers, the watchdog said. The OEP is a new official body set up after Brexit to hold the government to account. Its first report, published on Thursday, says ministers have shown ambition but that action is too slow. The government launched a 25-year environment plan in 2018, but the OEP says persistent and worrying declines continue and minister must take the opportunities provided by the new Environment Act to implement urgent and coherent measures. 'We're asking the government to recognise that tipping points are fast approaching in some areas. Because if it doesn't, it's going to be so much harder,' said Dame Glenys Stacey, the OEP chair. 'When you get to very limited numbers [of wildlife species], the effort involved in turning that around is immense and takes an awful long time.' She highlighted ongoing damage to marine wildlife. 'Progress there has been stately at best. But the government can, in large part, arrest these adverse trends, if it has the will.' Stacey added: 'A sustainable environment is not just nice to have but essential for human wellbeing, progress and prosperity. Turning the tide to achieve this is exceptionally difficult, yet it is needed urgently for our wealth, health and wellbeing, and absolutely essential for the generations to come. 'The first 25-year environment plan was an ambitious attempt to confront the challenges facing the environment, but progress towards delivering that ambition has been too slow. 'We continue to see worrying and persistent trends of environmental decline. But with the Environment Act, the government has a precious opportunity.' Simon Brockington, the OEP's chief insights officer, said: 'A tipping point arises at the point where a very slow and persistent decline suddenly becomes catastrophic. We're seeing long-term declines in biodiversity and we're calling on the government to address those. The serial setting of catch quotas above catch limits over time can lead to fish stock crash and we've seen many examples of that.' He also highlighted seabed trawling, which he said 'destroys the integrity of the ecosystem', and the pollution of farmland and rivers with fertilisers and livestock manure. 'For tipping points, it would be those I would highlight,' he said. Natalie Prosser, the watchdog's chief executive, said the UK was one of the most biodiversity-depleted countries in the world, and air pollution caused tens of thousands of deaths a year. 'Changes in climate are affecting the environment and biodiversity. We are heading towards a major tipping point.' She said the government had missed many environmental targets, and funding for monitoring the environment had fallen in the last 10 years. The OEP report identifies six 'building blocks' needed to rescue the environment in the UK, including a comprehensive stocktake of the state of nature, a commitment to action from all government departments, long-term legally binding targets and accountability for delivering those targets. 'The building blocks need to be firmer, clearer and weightier and pursued with true determination and intent,' Stacey said. 'A lot of environmental trends take decades to become apparent and there are always more immediate pressures for government. So if we're not careful, the environment can always be second fiddle. We'll rue the day that we don't take stock and address that.' Richard Benwell, the head of Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of 65 nature and conservation charities, said: 'It has been 10 years since the government promised to pass on the environment in better condition - 10 years in which biodiversity has continued to decline. The OEP poses a simple challenge: that overarching ambition must now be rooted in ambitious targets and an urgent delivery strategy.' Joan Edwards, of the Wildlife Trusts, said: 'For all the initial promise of the 25-year environment plan, the government has been seriously dragging its feet. Targets for reversing nature's decline are so unambitious that in 20 years' time we could have even less wildlife than we have now. The steps outlined by the OEP provide a framework for government to deliver on its promises, but we need much greater political willpower.' Environment minister Rebecca Pow said: 'We welcome this report, which acknowledges that our Environment Act gives us new tools to make a real difference to our environment, putting it at the heart of government and transitioning us to a sustainable future with nature on the road to recovery during this decade. We are currently consulting on legally binding environmental targets, which include a world-leading target to halt species decline by 2030.'", "835772f165cff0d5a5ffa116614e6276d4ff4b4ac52ba28d1a661e3b": "Sri Lanka's beleaguered president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, has sworn in a new prime minister to replace his brother as the country reels from days of violence. The new PM, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has held the post five times before, will head up a 'unity government' tasked with finding a way out of Sri Lanka's worst economic crisis since independence, with severe shortages of food, fuel and medicines and long power cuts. The 73-year-old, a stalwart of Sri Lankan politics for more than four decades, last served as prime minister between 2015 and 2019 after an election that unseated the powerful Rajapaksa clan from power after more than a decade. Wickremesinghe visited a Buddhist temple after taking his oath and told journalists he will work with both the opposition and governing party to find solutions to the hardships faced by the people. 'We want to return the nation to a position where our people will once again have three meals a day,' Wickremesinghe said . 'Our youth must have a future.' He heads the United National party (UNP), which has only one seat in parliament, but Vajira Abeywardena, a UNP official, said a Wickremesinghe-led government had the majority support of 160 out of 225 MPs. 'He is being sworn in as prime minister ... because a number of members of parliament have asked him to take over and solve the country's problems,' Abeywardena said. Mahinda Rajakapsa, the president's brother, reluctantly resigned as prime minister on Monday after violent attacks by the family's supporters on peaceful anti-government protesters. Protesters have blamed the president for devastating economic mismanagement and corruption that have pushed Sri Lanka to the brink of bankruptcy, and repeatedly called on him to quit. It is unclear whether Wickremesinghe's appointment will be enough to placate them. Monday's attacks by pro-government supporters of the Rajapaksas on a peaceful protest camp in Colombo led to several days of violence in which at least nine people were killed and more than 200 injured. Dozens of residences owned by the Rajapaksas and their loyalists were set on fire. The army was deployed across Colombo, police were given orders to shoot looters on sight, and a nationwide curfew was in place until Thursday morning. Mahinda Rajapaksa's resignation meant the government and cabinet was dissolved, leaving a power vacuum. The main opposition SJB party was initially invited to lead a new government, but its leader, Sajith Premadasa, insisted the president step down first. Wickremsinghe is seen as a pro-west free-market reformist, potentially making bailout negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and others smoother. He has criticised decision-making by the Rajapaksas, particularly its refusal to go to the IMF, and was among those who called for Mahinda Rajapaksa to step down after Monday's violence. Some see Wickremesinghe as a safe pair of hands to run an interim government, but others questioned his appointment given that his party has only one seat in parliament and said citizens wanted sweeping reforms. Opposition politicians Anura Dissananayake said the choice of Wickremesinghe was more about protecting the president and his family from public anger over his role in the economic crisis than solving the country's problems. Members of Sri Lanka's influential Buddhist clergy have already signalled their dissatisfaction with the appointment of the veteran politician. 'What we asked for is a new government that will include fresh blood, not those whose who have already been rejected by the people,' said leading monk Omale Sobitha. In an interview with the Guardian in April, Wickremesinghe denied he had any intention of joining the government, despite reports he was working with the Rajapaksas behind the scenes. 'No, no, I'm only getting involved in the sense of helping to resolve some of the economic issues from the outside, I'm not joining the government as a minister or anything,' he said. 'That leaves me free. I have no interest except to make sure people are fed and parliament takes control of the situation.' Amid fears that members of the ruling elite might try to flee the country, the courts imposed an overseas travel ban on Thursday on 17 leaders of the governing Sri Lanka People's Front (SLPP), including Mahinda Rajapaksa and his son Namal.", "d60ba727139123cbfcd93aea233f197bbc358d300f70a77e2539b95a": "All 4,000 inhabitants of a small town in Canada's Northwest Territories have been ordered to evacuate as parts of the country struggle with some of the worst flooding in decades. Chief April Martel of the Katl'odeeche First Nation ordered her entire community to leave Hay River after breakaway ice sent floodwaters surging into the centre of the town on Wednesday. The local department of infrastructure had declared the only road link to the town's airport impassable, closing it off. A section of ice broke away on Wednesday, sending a fresh surge which covered downtown Hay River in a foot or more of water within minutes. Some residents reported being rescued from their homes by boat. The town sits at the mouth of the Hay River, where it flows into the Great Slave Lake on a miniature delta through which several river channels run. Ice jamming those channels had blocked water and a weekend of rain and snow in the river's basin added more more and more water into that system. 'There was a large volume of ice, a large volume of snow in the basin over winter, and then this storm hit - initially as rain, which then flowed directly into streams and creeks, bumping up the water level immediately - and it parked over the entire basin,' territorial hydrologist Shawne Kokelj said this week. 'Now what we're seeing is there's still high water coming from farther upstream because a lot of rain fell there, too, and now some of the snow is melting and so keeps feeding a lot of these smaller streams. Justin Gaudet of the Paddle Prairie Mtis Settlement, where about 800 people live said a local emergency alert was issued Sunday after rain and snowmelt raised water levels on six nearby rivers to heights that elders in the community last saw more than 50 years ago. 'Some of these homes don't have running water right now,' Gaudet said late Wednesday. 'The members are very tired, very stressed, very anxious,' he said. Gaudet said the water level had lowered, but moisture and contaminated water pose the threat of mold damage, and he said some bridges are also damaged. 'A lot of our homes in the hamlet area sit on wood foundations and are nearly 40 to 50 years old,' he said. 'Without the bridges, people can't leave their homes.' The Dene Tha' First Nation at Chateh, about 845km north-west (525 miles) of Edmonton, and the Little Red River Cree have also been under local emergency alerts due to flooding since the weekend. The mayor of High Level said Tuesday that some evacuees living in the town's arena and hotels were running out of food.

An Israeli Civil Administration subcommittee meeting on Thursday approved the building plans and retroactively 'legalised' two outposts in Area C, the 60% of the West Bank under full Israeli control. The news came a day after the Israeli military demolished Palestinian homes in an area where about 1,000 people face the threat of eviction to make way for a military training zone. Since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, approximately 600,000 to 750,000 Jewish settlers have moved to live on land in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The practice is considered by most of the international community to be illegal, and a major impediment to achieving lasting peace. Under Israeli law, outposts are defined as settlements built without authorisation from the Israeli government. Settler communities are granted permission to build permanent structures connected to the electrical grid and water supply, while building permits for Palestinians living alongside them are almost always denied. Many Palestinians live under the constant threat of eviction, and face a rising tide of settler violence designed to displace them from their homes. Thursday's batch of approvals is the biggest advancement of settlement plans since Biden took office. During Donald Trump's administration, there was a 150% growth in settlement compared with during Barack Obama's second term. Biden's White House, however, is opposed to settlements, which it says undercut the viability of a two-state solution. Israeli officials have denied local media reports that Washington had conditioned the US president's June visit on there being no new announcements of settlement construction. There was no immediate comment from the Palestinians or the US on the settlement approvals. They came on the heels of Wednesday's demolition of Palestinian homes and structures in Masafer Yatta, a cluster of villages in an area south of Hebron that Israel has designated as a military training zone. After a two-decade legal dispute, Israel's high court said last week that about 1,000 Palestinians in Masafer Yatta could be evicted. The ruling is one of the single biggest expulsion decisions since the occupation began. Israel's ideologically diverse government, which was sworn in last June, encompasses leftists who oppose settlement building; rightwingers, such as the prime minister, Naftali Bennett, who previously led a settler lobbying group; and, for the first time, members of an Arab party. Initially united by their desire to remove from office the longtime former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and end four years of political turmoil, an agreement to focus on areas of common ground in governance has faltered when it comes to the occupation. The opening of the Knesset's summer session this week was hit by immediate turbulence. The ruling coalition recently lost its already narrow majority, while a wave of violence - much of it focused on Jerusalem's sensitive al-Aqsa compound - led the United Arab List, or Ra'am, faction to suspend its cooperation. The Ra'am leader, Mansour Abbas, said on Wednesday that his party had for now decided to continue its partnership with the government for the benefit of Israel's Palestinian minority of 2 million people, thwarting opposition initiatives this week to pass no-confidence votes in the Knesset.", "9740a88f8ec090a35782c81f7fadd042c669550dea0d479ea7512587": "Rebekah Vardy has been accused of throwing her former agent and friend 'under a bus' in a last-ditch attempt to save her reputation in the 'Wagatha Christie' libel trial. The footballer's wife was accused - during the third day of a libel trial at the high court on Thursday - of deliberately destroying evidence, habitually leaking stories to the Sun newspaper, and trying to shift the blame on to her adviser Caroline Watt. The court heard that just days before the trial began, Vardy said she had belatedly realised after almost three years that she may have been 'betrayed' by her agent, who was a close friend.  Vardy told the court that it could have been Watt who was secretly leaking stories from Coleen Rooney's private Instagram account to the Sun - all without Vardy's knowledge or authorisation. Coleen Rooney's lawyer, David Sherborne, said this was a desperate last-ditch move by Vardy to stitch up her friend: 'It's not her who betrayed you, it is you who has betrayed her by throwing her under a bus,' he said. Watt declined to give evidence at the trial, citing health reasons. But Sherborne said the real reason Watt would not enter the witness box was because it would expose the lies that had been told.  In response, Vardy insisted that Watt was unable to attend the court because she had been 'driven to suicidal thoughts by these proceedings' and the 'antics' of Rooney. Vardy chose to bring the libel case in a bid to restore her reputation, complaining that Rooney had 'weaponised her fanbase' when, in 2019, she made the original accusation that Vardy had leaked stories to the media. Rooney looked on impassively as the court heard comments Vardy made in a 2019 interview following the original accusation: 'Arguing with Coleen is like arguing with a pigeon. You can tell it that you are right and it is wrong but it's still going to shit in your hair.' The court also heard of extensive issues with the retrieval of potential crucial evidence in the case - including data contained in a mobile phone dropped in the North Sea. Vardy said one back-up of her WhatsApp account was missing many key images and voice notes because 'something odd happened as I was exporting the files' and they were lost. Sherborne alleged Vardy had purposefully chosen not to export potentially damaging evidence contained in the WhatsApp account, then disposed of the laptop used to make a back-up. He also claimed Vardy had manually deleted large numbers of messages to and from her agent. Asked what happened to nine months of missing WhatsApp chats between the two women, Vardy seemed unclear. She said she had 'potentially switched phones' during the period and lost the WhatsApp messages in the process but 'I can neither confirm or deny that'. Sherborne alleged in reality it was a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence: 'You deleted all of the messages between you and Caroline Watt.' The lawyer also mocked the suggestion that Watt had accidentally dropped her phone in the North Sea shortly after a request was made to search it for WhatsApp messages. The court heard that Watt 'was filming a coastline' while on a boat trip off Scotland when the boat hit a wave and she dropped the device into the water. Sherborne said he had wanted to search WhatsApp messages held on the phone but it was now 'lying at the bottom of sea in Davy Jones's locker'. Vardy asked the court: 'Who is Davy Jones?' The judge intervened to explain the reference. Rooney's legal team have admitted they do not have a smoking gun proving Vardy, the wife of Leicester City player Jamie Vardy, leaked stories about Rooney to the Sun. However, Sherborne told the court the circumstantial evidence was overwhelming: 'If it looks like a leak, it sounds like a leak, and you even used the word 'leak', it is more likely than not to be a leak.' During one exchange, Vardy admitted knowing that her agent was discussing private information about Rooney with Sun journalist Andy Halls - but insisted it was material the newspaper already knew and therefore not a fresh leak. Sherborne asked Vardy: 'You didn't object at any stage to the fact that Ms Watt was plainly passing on information from Mrs Rooney's private Instagram account to Andy Halls?' Vardy replied: 'I didn't think she was passing on any new information.' Sherborne pressed on: 'Take the word 'new' out of it. Did you, or did you not, know that Ms Watt was passing on information from Mrs Rooney's private account?' Vardy replied: 'She was talking to Mr Halls about information that was already being discussed.' In one WhatsApp exchange read to the court, the agent said a reporter at the Sun wanted to know whether Rooney had definitely crashed her car, a detail that allegedly came from the private Instagram account. Vardy replied with the words: 'Haha she deffo did.' Towards the end of Thursday's hearing, Vardy - who launched the multimillion pound legal case against Rooney in a bid to clear her public reputation - slumped forward with her head in her hands while being cross-examined. The court took regular breaks as she became tearful. When Vardy began one answer by saying 'if I'm honest', the barrister snapped back: 'I would hope you're honest because you're sitting in a witness box.' At one point Rooney's barrister described a WhatsApp message in a conversation between Vardy and Watt which said 'poor Coleen' followed by 'laughing emojis'. Vardy told the court she disputed this characterisation: 'I don't know whether they're laughing emojis.' The lawyer, in an apparent reference to the  emoji, replied: 'OK, crying with laughter.' The trial continues.", "8efe473140140d55ad1c2b3030e55c08b1f09cd0b76ae5bf1d59145e": "", "98b0b3d0e7effb3600a715d7017eeb03c30f1ed188d7ec0cb5acbc7b": "Critics have accused the European Commission of seeking to end encrypted communications after the EU's executive body unveiled strict regulations for messaging apps intended to fight the spread of child sexual abuse imagery. Under the proposed regulations, messaging services and web hosts would be required to search for, and report, child abuse material - even in the case of encrypted messaging services like Apple's iMessage and Facebook's WhatsApp that cannot be scanned in such a way.  'Detection, reporting and removal of child sexual abuse online is urgently needed to prevent the sharing of images and videos of the sexual abuse of children, which retraumatises the victims often years after the sexual abuse has ended,' said Ylva Johansson, the EU's commissioner for home affairs on Thursday. 'Today's proposal sets clear obligations for companies to detect and report the abuse of children, with strong safeguards guaranteeing privacy of all, including children,' she added. Andy Burrows, head of child safety online at the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), welcomed the proposals, which he described as an 'impressively bold and ambitious' attempt to 'systemically prevent avoidable child abuse and grooming, which is taking place at record levels'. He added: 'If approved, it will place a clear requirement on platforms to combat abuse wherever it takes place, including in private messaging where children are at greatest risk.' But the plans have also been criticised as an attack on privacy. 'Private companies would be tasked not just with finding and stopping distribution of known child abuse images, but could also be required to take action to prevent 'grooming' or suspected future child abuse,' said Joe Mullin of Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a privacy group. 'This would be a massive new surveillance system, because it would require the infrastructure for detailed analysis of user messages.' The regulation does not technically require providers to turn off end-to-end encryption entirely. Instead, it allows providers to apply automated techniques to scan for abusive material on users' devices - a compromise that supporters say preserves privacy while also helping deter child abuse. It is a similar approach to that proposed - but indefinitely postponed - by Apple, when the company suggested scanning photos before they were uploaded to its cloud storage. Apple's approach, however, only scanned photos looking for examples of existing child abuse imagery. The commission's proposal includes a requirement to detect newly created images, and even to look for active grooming, which is far harder to successfully achieve with existing automated systems without compromising privacy. It also suggests that app stores, like those run by Apple and Google, should be involved in enforcing the requirements, pulling apps that don't comply with the scanning obligations. Patrick   Breyer, German MEP for the   Pirate   party, called the proposals 'fundamental   rights   terrorism   against   trust,   self-determination   and   security   on   the  iInternet'. He added: 'The   proposed   chat   control   threatens   to   destroy   digital   privacy   of   correspondence   and   secure  encryption. ' Scanning   personal   cloud   storage   would   result   in   the   mass   surveillance   of   private   photos. Mandatory   age   verification   would   end   anonymous   communication.' The   proposal   does   not   include   the   overdue   obligation   on   law   enforcement   agencies   to   report   and   remove   known   abusive   material   on   the   net,   nor   does   it   provide   for   Europe-wide   standards   for   effective   prevention   measures,   victim   support   and   counselling   and   effective   criminal   investigations.  'This   Big   Brother   attack   on   our   mobile   phones,   private   messages   and   photos   with   the   help   of   error-prone   algorithms   is   a   giant   step   towards   a   Chinese-style   surveillance   state,' Breyer said.", "631018ceaacdb9f2724b94188b81500008d55ecc7cce10aa19fbfbd5": "Granting Levi Bellfield's request to get married in prison is 'inconceivable' unless serious safeguarding concerns are addressed, Dominic Raab has said. Bellfield, who murdered Marsha McDonnell, Amelie Delagrange and Milly Dowler, is engaged and has requested a prison wedding, the Ministry of Justice has confirmed. It is understood that his application is being processed. He would need the permission of the prison governor to marry at HMP Frankland in Durham. The justice secretary said on Thursday that a prison wedding was unlikely because the 53-year-old posed a risk to his fiancee. When asked what powers he had to stop the wedding, Raab - who is also deputy prime minister - criticised the Human Rights Act. 'The Human Rights Act puts all sorts of obstacles in our way in that regard, which is I think one more reason why we are introducing a bill of rights to add a bit more common sense,' he said. 'What I can tell you is it is inconceivable that the prison or the Ministry of Justice would authorise that marriage unless the very significant concerns about the safeguarding were addressed. We've asked for a risk assessment in relation to that. Clearly, we're dealing with a dangerous serial killer.' Raab said it was very difficult to see how the safeguarding concerns could be overcome. The prisons minister, Victoria Atkins, had earlier ordered an immediate review into Bellfield's request, describing it as 'absolutely appalling'. She told Sky News: 'I just want to reassure people, I understand an application has been made that has not been decided yet, and he most certainly has not yet married, but, if I may, he's currently got the right under article 12 of the Human Rights Act to get married ... or they have the right to have the application to be considered by prison governors. '[It's] absolutely appalling. I've ordered an immediate review into this. I very much welcome the debate we're about to have about the bill of rights and looking at human rights for the United Kingdom for the 21st century. Believe me, I'll be raising this.' News of the story, which first appeared in the Sun, said Bellfield proposed to his fiancee in front of prison staff. Speaking to the newspaper, the former justice secretary Robert Buckland said: 'Milly never got to see her wedding day. It cannot be right that he gets to have his. People will be rightly shocked to hear that a man capable of such depraved crimes and is rightly imprisoned is able to form a relationship of this kind.' Bellfield was given a whole-life term for murdering McDonnell, 19, in 2003, and for murdering Delagrange, 22, and attempting to murder Kate Sheedy, 18, in 2004. He was already serving this sentence when he went on trial for killing Milly, who was abducted while walking from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and killing the 13-year-old after a trial at the Old Bailey in 2011.", "f95d6378479492c584a9247d9a40c549a2a0fd048b57516e86afdb32": "Workers took Donald Trump's name off his hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC on Wednesday, after the completion of the $375m sale of the lease to investors from Florida. House Democrats estimate the former president, under legal and financial pressure on multiple fronts, will reportedly gain $100m from the sale, once a loan for the renovations is paid off. One ethics group called the hotel 'a sinkhole of corruption'. During Trump's four years in the White House, the hotel became a magnet for aides, supporters and foreign businesses seeking favour. Critics and ethics groups were particularly concerned about the situation as Trump did not formally divest himself from the Trump Organization. The presidential historian Michael Beschloss predicted that even after the sale 'political ghosts will linger'. The hotel lost more than $70m in the four years of Trump's presidency, including losses each year before pandemic shutdowns in 2020. Many hotel brokers, owners and consultants did not expect the 263-room hotel, located close to the White House, to fetch such a high price. The price of the lease, equivalent to more than $1.4m a room, has drawn scrutiny from Democrats in Congress. The New York Times reported that JLL, a real estate firm, put the average sales price for hotels in Washington in 2020 at $354,000 per room. CGI Merchant Group, the buyer, reportedly plans to turn the hotel into a branch of the Waldorf Astoria hotel chain. Earlier this month, the House oversight committee requested documents from CGI, listing all investors, which reportedly include the former New York Yankees slugger and confessed drugs cheat Alex Rodriguez. The sale marks the end of a controversial chapter in Trump's rise. The real estate magnate opened the Trump International Hotel in the Old Post Office building in 2016, during his run for the presidency. In a statement on Wednesday, Eric Trump, Trump's second son, said: 'We took a dilapidated and underutilised building and transformed it into one of the most iconic hotels in the world.' The hotel had long attracted criticism for perceived conflicts of interest. Recently, the Trump Organization and Trump's 2017 presidential inaugural committee agreed to pay $750,000 to settle a suit brought by the District of Columbia attorney general that claimed the hotel received excessive payments from the committee. On news of the settlement, Carolyn Maloney, the Democratic chair of the House oversight committee, said her concerns about the sale of the lease 'had only increased'. The building is still owned by the federal government, which approved the sale of the lease in March. When Trump was in power, claims or lawsuits under the emoluments clause of the constitution, which covers gifts and payments to office holders, could not stick. In 2019, Kathleen Clark, Washington University Law professor, told the Guardian: 'For over a hundred years, the justice department has strictly interpreted the constitution's anti-corruption emoluments clause to prohibit federal officials from accepting anything of value from foreign governments, absent congressional consent. 'In 2017, the department reversed course, adopting arguments nearly identical to those put forward by Trump's private sector lawyers. Instead of defending the republic against foreign influence, the department ... defend[ed] Trump's ability to receive money from foreign governments.' On Wednesday, the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or Crew, said: 'The Trump Hotel in DC is no more. Good riddance to a sinkhole of corruption.' But it also said: 'We still have some questions ... namely, whether a 'premium sale price' for a hotel that has been losing money is justified and what are the outstanding security risks to the hotel.' Mark S Zaid, an attorney in Washington who specialises in cases involving the federal government, added: 'I still count this as vindication for our legal efforts to remove Trump from this majestic building. We started an effort that contributed. It took longer than it should have.'", "e33a6462b913ef13c8895dd2bda27f14b79ab93cdc7ca767305978f7": "Twitter announced the departure of two top leaders in a major shakeup that comes as billionaire Elon Musk is working to close a $44bn deal to acquire the company. In an email to employees on Thursday, chief executive Parag Agrawal said Twitter's leaders for consumer product and revenue will leave the company. Agrawal said the company was temporarily pausing hiring, and would review all existing job offers to determine whether any 'should be pulled back'. Agrawal said Twitter was not able to hit user growth and revenue milestones to maintain confidence that it could reach aggressive growth targets it had set in 2020. 'We need to continue to be intentional about our teams, hiring and costs,' Agrawal wrote. 'We are pulling back on non-labor costs to ensure we are being responsible and efficient,' the company added in a statement to Reuters. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment. Among the departures are the social media platform's head of consumer product, Kayvon Beykpour, and head of revenue, Bruce Falck. Both executives confirmed their exits on Thursday morning on Twitter. Beykpour said he was informed he would be terminated while on paternity leave. 'The truth is that this isn't how and when I imagined leaving Twitter, and this wasn't my decision,' he said in a tweet. 'Parag asked me to leave after letting me know that he wants to take the team in a different direction.' Falck was also fired, according to a tweet that has since been deleted. His Twitter bio now says 'unemployed'. Agrawal had installed both the executives in those roles in a reorganization of the company when he took over as chief executive officer in December, after founder Jack Dorsey stepped down from the role. The departures come as the tech industry grapples with a slowdown following explosive growth amid the pandemic, which sent many workplaces online. Facebook parent company Meta also is 'slowing growth' in hiring, it confirmed Wednesday, after difficult earnings reports in recent quarters. Musk's decision to buy Twitter has raised concerns with investors and employees over the future of the company. Twitter shares fell to $46 on Thursday, well below the purchase price Musk agreed to of $54.20. On his personal account, where he has 92.5 million followers, Musk has mused about creating a subscription model for the social media platform, verifying all users, and returning the homepage to a chronological timeline from its current algorithmic feed. Twitter's reorganization could also create some financial cushion should Musk choose to back out of the deal, which will take months to finalize. The executive could still walk away from the purchase, though he would be required to pay a $1bn fee to do so. Musk is worth more than $220bn.", "530a847ed5b1d3ab05b48db2a0e45545ea2a0d8240dc72312c2f9edc": "The Nobel prize-winning author Mario Vargas Llosa, Latin America's most eminent living chronicler of power and corruption, has declared a preference for Jair Bolsonaro over Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as Brazil prepares to head to the polls later this year. The 86-year-old Peruvian writer, who also holds Spanish citizenship, revealed his thoughts on October's election during a talk in Uruguay on Wednesday. 'The Bolsonaro case is a very difficult one,' he told an audience in Montevideo. 'Bolsonaro's clowning around is very difficult for a liberal to accept. But now, between Bolsonaro and Lula, I of course prefer Bolsonaro. Even with Bolsonaro's foolishness, he's not Lula.' The writer, who was beaten to the Peruvian presidency in 1990 by Alberto Fujimori, said Lula was regarded fondly in Europe despite having been convicted 'of being a thief'. The controversial corruption charges to which Vargas Llosa referred were annulled last year. His support for Bolsonaro, however, was far from uncritical when it came to the president's attacks on Covid vaccines. 'It's insane, it's absurd to oppose [them] in the way he has,' Vargas Llosa said. 'It seems absolutely irresponsible to me.' It is not the first time the novelist has thrown his weight behind a rightwing candidate. A few months before the second round of last year's presidential election in Peru, Vargas Llosa set aside decades of lacerating criticism of the Fujimori political dynasty when he called on voters to support his former foe's daughter Keiko rather than her far-left opponent, Pedro Castillo, who nonetheless prevailed. 'Peruvians should vote for Keiko Fujimori because she represents the lesser of two evils, and if she's in power there are more possibilities of saving our democracy,' he wrote in his column in Spain's El Pais. In 2009 Alberto Fujimori - whose time as president was marked by Shining Path terrorism, economic upheaval and political corruption - was given a 25-year prison sentence for authorising death squads and presiding over rampant graft and vote-rigging. When neighbouring Chile voted in its final-round presidential election last December, Vargas Llosa backed the ultra-conservative Jose Antonio Kast over the leftwing Gabriel Boric, the eventual winner. The political scientist Daniel V Guisado noted that the novelist had also supported unsuccessful candidates in Spain, Argentina and Bolivia in recent years. 'Getting Vargas Llosa's backing is the biggest political tombstone of the last century,' Guisado tweeted, adding: 'Congratulations to Lula.' Progressive Brazilians took the comments as further proof that the author of The Time of the Hero and The Feast of the Goat had lost the plot. 'What a sad figure,' tweeted the political economist Filipe Campante. 'He has lost all political lucidity,' agreed Lucas Paulino, a centrist anti-Bolsonaro campaigner from the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte. The Brazilian writer Sergio Rodrigues said the writer's record on backing failed candidates made him 'Don Vargas Loser'. Vargas Llosa, who has drifted further to the right with age, caused a stir in October last year when he said voting the right way in elections was more important than having free elections. 'Latin America will undoubtedly emerge from [a very difficult situation] when Latin Americans discover that they've voted badly,' he told the national convention of Spain's conservative People's party. 'The important thing in elections isn't that there's freedom in those elections; it's voting well - and voting well is something that's very important because countries that vote badly, as has happened in some Latin American countries, pay dearly for it.'", "86ac44edadabbf0cf0064823eda94f0ece6039fef682b80f33fab101": "", "426d743579c37ddf5d7fa986516a0853d9b3403288142a1f11f18798": "When the incredible but short-lived iPod Mini was released in 2004, it wasn't available in the UK at first. I had to ask friends in Florida to bring one over for my son's 12th birthday. He loved showing his friends this device that looked like it belonged in the future. Our family has had plenty of iPods over the years; an early iPod with a click wheel, a mini, three Nanos, two Shuffles, and a Classic. My wife still takes her 2007 'fat iPod nano' on holiday as she doesn't like taking her iPhone to the pool. As a music player, an iPod has none of the potential distractions of a phone. No emails, no messages, and no notifications. It's a shame there will be no more iPods as there's still a place for a distraction-free music player. My 2007 black iPhone Classic is still permanently attached to the hi-fi in my car. It's a 160Gb model and contains my entire music collection - ripped from CDs - as it was a few years ago. The battery doesn't last, but that doesn't matter as it's constantly connected to USB power in my car. Andy Clarke, software designer, Wales, UK  I bought my first iPod in 2004 in Singapore. It was a 40GB iPod and came with so many accessories - a docking port charger, headphones, a protective carry case, you name it. I had all my music digitised and on my iPod - it was so easy back then. The wheel on the original iPods used to drive me a bit crazy as it was sensitive to the slightest touch; you'd try to move forwards on a playlist and you'd skip too many songs, so you'd try to go back but would go too far the other way. I still have my first iPod, and it still worked the last time I tried it. The biggest problem I have is finding a charger as Apple have changed them so many times. Sadly, I got rid of my docking port - more fool me. But I won't get rid of the iPod as it works and a museum might want it one day. I still use my iPod Shuffle - it's so much easier at the gym than a phone. I use my phone everywhere else, but I've found quite a lot of what I listen to is not available on Spotify. I'm sorry to see the iPod go simply because I can't afford what Apple charge for an iPhone with memory large enough to get all of my music and playlists on to. Elizabeth Dennett, 58, New Zealand The iPod arrived in that teenage sweet spot where music is everything. In the same way people venerate vinyl now, this was my format. I'd load up on CDs at Selectadisc in Nottingham, rip them to iTunes, shelve them and mooch off into college or town with the latest stuff blasting out. It's the device on which I formed memories with Radiohead, Wilco, REM, Bloc Party, Blur, Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, Beck, Gorillaz and loads of other bands that now seem really ancient. Shuffle was there for the quick five-minute blast between lessons or work shifts where you just needed to fill your brain with music, but I was almost always a snob about listening to albums from back to front. And always dreamed of someone picking up my iPod and commenting on how great my music taste was and asking me to marry them. Times change and it's a miracle to have essentially every song streamable in my pocket, with wireless headphones. But I'm also an old git now with responsibilities - and I miss the iPod days. Nothing will quite touch that feeling of powering around town filling my brain with endless new music on a distraction-free, dedicated, insanely cool, easy-to-use piece of overpriced tech that wasn't also a portal to social media hell. Matt, 33, reporter, Nottingham, UK  In the second week of January 2005 my father took me to John Lewis in Reading for the sole purpose of trying to find the elusive fourth generation 40 GB model. It had sold out everywhere before Christmas and I was desperate to finally get my first ever iPod. I'd been using a CD Walkman for years, but the iPod was tiny (for the time), sleek, intuitive to use, and looked like one of those futuristic devices from a 50s sci-fi comic. It went everywhere with me - carrying songs ripped from all my parents' CDs; Queen, Erik Satie, Bob Dylan, Weezer, the Rocky soundtrack, and eventually thousands of other tracks ripped from friends' computers using a rather cheeky piece of free software called MyTunes Redux. The following year, it got crushed in a bike accident, but I woke up in hospital with it still playing next to me, screen cracked and the body split down the seam - my first taste of heartbreak. Seventeen years later, I still can't bring myself to throw the old 40GB away, so I use it to store camera memory cards in the cable drawer. I'm surprisingly heavy-hearted about it, and probably feel very similar to how people felt when the original Game Boy was discontinued in 2003, which marked the end of an era for iconic gaming devices. When the news broke about Apple dropping it, I admit, I went straight to the site and ordered a new Touch to keep in the cable drawer as back-up for when my ageing iPod Video finally calls it a day. I'm just not ready to switch systems. Alexander Lerche, 34, photojournalist, Doha, Qatar  I first saw an iPod in a client's office in 2002. I was totally smitten. My wife bought me my first iPod (20GB) for Christmas that year. It took me an entire weekend to upload all my CDs into iTunes to transfer to the iPod. Having lugged about cases of LPs as a teenager, I couldn't believe I had all my music in my pocket, available to play at will. I remember the thrill of opening the box - beautiful, smooth cardboard with the strap line 'Designed in California'. And then the gorgeous white iPod, which felt so good in the palm of my hand. I also remember paying a small fortune to have a car kit installed so I could play anything from my music collection while driving. When I first took my iPod to the beach, I enclosed it in a waterproof, shockproof case - I was paranoid about not damaging it in any way. The iPod was a real breakthrough, and thanks to technology I can now listen to anything at anytime via my iPhone or MacBook. I no longer use mine now - the battery can't be charged. But I will always keep my original iPod. Nigel Wilson, 66, yoga teacher, Kent, UK  My dad went to the States in 2004 and came back with a third generation iPod for my brother and I was outraged. He wasn't ever kind enough to lend it to me, but instead I would steal his spare set of headphones and just put the plug end into my pocket so I would look cool going to school. I had a friend around that same time and she had an iPod Shuffle which she was kind enough to lend, and I recall her love for Eminem. Even to this day, when I hear Eminem the memories of that Shuffle come back. When I eventually got my own third gen in 2006 I started to really find my own music taste for the first time. I used to spend hours uploading music from CDs and making sure every song had all the info perfectly recorded so I could handpick each one and put it cleanly into its appropriate playlist. I made lifelong friends in those early days as we swapped music and bonded over certain songs or artists. I still have all the music I ever loaded on to it on a special hard drive at home. My first album was Aladdin, the soundtrack.

Sunlight shines through the morning mist. 'Humans,' intones renowned primatologist Dr Jane Goodall. 'What unusual animals we are.' As the camera pans over a closeup shot of a male model's boxer briefs, the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees says, 'It's a big job making our world a better place, but getting started? Well, that's as easy as changing your underwear.' This 30-second ad, for Australian underwear company Boody, is now airing. Billboards from the campaign will soon be erected around Sydney and Melbourne. 'It's interesting,' says Associate Prof Michal Carrington, a researcher in ethical consumption at Melbourne University. 'Because you wouldn't expect Dame Jane Goodall to be fronting a campaign for underwear.' Elliot Midalia, co-managing director of Boody, says: 'We didn't want to just get any influencer or celebrity. 'Jane was the top of our list, and we're so happy that she said yes. We couldn't believe it.' Goodall's fee - a sum Boody are not contractually allowed to disclose - was paid directly to the Jane Goodall Institute. It's not the first time Goodall has appeared in advertising - she has also modelled for Stella McCartney and appeared in commercials for HP.  While the final cut of the commercial shows Goodall surrounded by models, the ad was shot in two parts. Goodall was filmed against a green screen in London, while the rest of the campaign footage was captured in Australia. Then, she was superimposed into the scene. 'She had a laugh about it, made a few jokes about how funny it was that she'd be out there with underwear models around her,' says Roy Leibowitz, one of the campaign's creative directors. 'She's so professional, it just seemed to come easy.' Goodall's outfit in the advertisement was also made by Boody. Midalia says they already had plans to make a turtleneck ('her signature,' as he puts it), but when the institute confirmed she would work with the brand, 'we quickly expedited that'. Carrington describes an endorsement from Goodall as 'significant'. 'Someone like Jane Goodall is not going to be part of any campaign that's going to detract from ... her credibility.' Boody is a B Corp certified business, a 1% for the Planet participant, and manufacture their garments from Forest Stewardship Council-certified bamboo. Midalia describes that ad's message as 'really about sustainability, about getting people to make a switch to an underwear that supports the planet'. While Carrington says the conservation message is important, she questions the efficacy of such a positive approach. 'Pulling my academic hat on,' she says, research suggests that when you want to engage people in an ethical decision, 'no matter what the message, or the cause, you really need to switch people on morally'. She notes that the campaign does not explain the impacts it is trying to address, from the destruction of native forests to the way cotton farming might deplete water resources. The most effective messages, Carrington says, create 'what we call moral shock'. 'This ad campaign doesn't really give that sense of moral shock, or that sense of why ... The sense that people in their own actions are implicated.' On the other hand, Carrington says, 'there is a whole argument going on about how much responsibility a consumer can have'. 'While it's great to see companies taking responsibility themselves and developing [more sustainable] products ... how much responsibility do we want to place on the consumer? 'From a cynical perspective you could say 'Well why isn't there legislation out there to stop the harmful effects of clothing?''", "73e074608c9c673da0a200d34f165d143c6db3acf2d3c1b4a5d1d0a7": "", "a90237bd8f42899ebb4f907c65e62219680615a0ccb9c623d829ad61": "", "13f39d608d51e00f43b7d82866f1c08f9390df3ee8960a8eb1c8929b": "", "9362248ba365faffe9469c056c899033e1a99016d1dc6247ed13f24e": "On an August morning in 1945, 600 metres over the Japanese city of Hiroshima, a small sun came briefly into existence. Few remember a sound, but the flash printed shadows on the pavements and sent buildings thrashing. The explosion - 2,000 times greater than that of any bomb yet used - announced not only a new weapon but a new era. It was a stunning military victory for the United States. Yet jubilation there was undercut by 'uncertainty and fear', the newsman Edward R Murrow observed. It took only a moment's reflection on the bomb's existence to see the harrowing implication: what had happened in Hiroshima, and three days later in Nagasaki, could happen anywhere. The thought proved impossible to shake, especially as, within the year, on-the-ground accounts emerged. Reports came of flesh bubbling, of melted eyes, of a terrifying sickness afflicting even those who'd avoided the blast. 'All the scientists are frightened - frightened for their lives,' a Nobel-winning chemist confessed in 1946. Despite scientists' hopes that the weapons would be retired, in the coming decades they proliferated, with nuclear states testing ever-more-powerful devices on Pacific atolls, the Algerian desert and the Kazakh steppe. The fear - the pervasive, enduring fear - that characterised the cold war is hard to appreciate today. It wasn't only powerless city-dwellers who were terrified ('select and fortify a room in which to shelter', the UK government grimly advised). Leaders themselves were shaken. It was 'insane', US president John F Kennedy felt, that 'two men, sitting on the opposite sides of the world, should be able to decide to bring an end to civilisation'. Yet everyone knowingly lived with that insanity for decades. It was as if, wrote the historian Paul Boyer, 'the Bomb' were 'one of those categories of Being, like Space and Time, that, according to Kant, are built into of the very structure of our minds, giving shape and meaning to all our perceptions'. Boyer remembered the unsettling news of the Hiroshima bombing, which occurred the week of his 10th birthday and shaped the rest of his childhood. Today, someone remembering the bomb that well would have to be 86 at least. The memory of nuclear war, once vivid, is quietly vanishing. The signs on the fallout shelters - those that remain - are rusted, and most of the world's population can't even recall an above-ground nuclear test (the last was in 1980). The bomb no longer gives 'shape and meaning to all our perceptions'; until recently, many thought of it only rarely. It has been tempting to see nuclear war as a bygone terror that no longer terrifies, like polio. Except that the threat of nuclear war, as Vladimir Putin is reminding the world, has not gone away. Russia has amassed the world's largest collection of nuclear weapons, and Putin has threatened to 'use them, if we have to'. The odds that he may are steadily increasing as Nato countries inch toward direct conflict with Russia. They are now sending Ukraine tanks and missiles, amassing troops in eastern Europe and providing intelligence that has allowed Ukrainians to target and kill Russian generals and sink a Russian warship. If this continues, the risk of nuclear war will be 'considerable', Russia's foreign minister has warned. 'The danger is serious, real, and we must not underestimate it.' Yet many of Putin's adversaries seem either unconvinced or, worse, unbothered by his threats. Boris Johnson has flatly dismissed the idea that Russia may use a nuclear weapon. Three former Nato supreme allied commanders have proposed a no-fly zone over Ukraine. This would almost certainly entail direct military conflict between Nato and Russia, and possibly trigger the world's first all-out war between nuclear states. Still, social media boils over with calls to action, and a poll found that more than a third of US respondents wanted their military to intervene 'even if it risks a nuclear conflict'. Nuclear norms are fraying elsewhere, too. Nine countries collectively hold some 10,000 warheads, and six of those countries are increasing their inventories. Current and recent leaders such as Kim Jong-un, Narendra Modi and Donald Trump have, like Putin, spoken brazenly of firing their weapons. After North Korea promised 'thousands-fold' revenge in 2017 for sanctions on its accelerating nuclear weapons programme, Trump threatened a pre-emptive strike, pledging to unleash 'fire and fury like the world has never seen'. 'This is analogous to the Cuban missile crisis,' one of Trump's former aides, Sebastian Gorka, insisted. Leaders have talked tough before. But now their talk seems less tethered to reality. This the first decade when not a single head of a nuclear state can remember Hiroshima. Does that matter? We've seen in other contexts what happens when our experience of a risk attenuates. In rich countries, the waning memory of preventable diseases has fed the anti-vaccination movement. 'People have become complacent,' notes epidemiologist Peter Salk, whose father, Jonas Salk, invented the polio vaccine. Not having lived through a polio epidemic, parents are rejecting vaccines to the point where measles and whooping cough are coming back and many have needlessly died of Covid-19. That is the danger with nuclear war. Using declassified documents, historians now understand how close we came, multiple times, to seeing the missiles fired. In those heartstopping moments, a visceral understanding of what nuclear war entailed helped keep the launch keys from turning. It's precisely that visceral understanding that's missing today. We're entering an age with nuclear weapons but no nuclear memory. Without fanfare, without even noticing, we may have lost a guardrail keeping us from catastrophe. The nuclear age started at 8.15am, 6 August 1945, with the release of a 4,400kg bomb from a B-29 over Hiroshima. Forty-three seconds later, an enormous explosion shattered the city. That so much destruction could be wrought so quickly was shocking news, which until then only a small coterie of scientists and military officials had known. 'One senses the foundations of one's own universe trembling,' a New York paper wrote in reaction to the terrifying new weapon. What did the bomb mean? Atomic scientists, who'd had time to contemplate the question, rushed in to explain. The important thing wasn't that atomic bombs could incinerate cities - conventional weapons were already accomplishing that. What distinguished atomic weapons was how easy they made it, noted J Robert Oppenheimer, who had helped oversee the bomb's development. Atomic weapons 'profoundly upset the precarious balance' between offence and defence that had governed war hitherto, Oppenheimer explained. A single plane, a single payload - no city was safe. The implications were, the scientists admitted, horrifying. Albert Einstein had proposed in 1939 that the US government develop nuclear weapons, in order to ensure that Adolf Hitler wouldn't acquire them first. But immediately after the war, he worried about any country possessing such power. Along with many of his colleagues, he concluded that the only solution was a global government, sovereign above existing countries, that would hold the world's nuclear arsenal, enforce laws and prevent wars (other details were vague). One World Or None was the title of a bestselling book that Einstein, Oppenheimer and other scientists produced in March 1946. Even the head of the US air force contributed a chapter pleading for 'a world organisation that will eliminate conflict by air power'. Five months later, the world heard from another set of voices. The US occupation authorities in Japan had censored details of the bomb's aftermath. But, without consulting the censors, the American writer John Hersey published in the New Yorker one of the most important long-form works of journalism ever written, a graphic account of the bombing. Born to missionaries in China, Hersey was unusually sympathetic to Asian perspectives. His Hiroshima article rejected the bomber's-eye view and instead told the stories of six survivors. For many readers, this was the first time they registered that Hiroshima wasn't a 'Japanese army base', as US president Harry Truman had described it when announcing the bombing, but a city of civilians - doctors, seamstresses, factory workers - who had watched loved ones die. Nor did they die cleanly, vaporised in the puff of a mushroom cloud. Hersey profiled a Methodist pastor, Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who raced to the aid of his ailing but very much still-living neighbours. As Tanimoto grasped one woman, 'her skin slipped off in huge, glove-pieces'. Tanimoto 'was so sickened by this that he had to sit down for a minute', wrote Hersey. 'He had to keep consciously repeating to himself, 'These are human beings.'' Hersey's contemporaries understood the significance of these accounts. The New Yorker dedicated its full issue to Hersey's article, and within an hour sold out its entire newsstand print run of 300,000 (plus another 200,000 copies to subscribers). Knopf published it as a book, which eventually sold millions. The text was reprinted in newspapers from France to China, the Netherlands to Bolivia. The massive ABC radio network broadcast Hersey's text - with no commercials, music or sound effects - over four consecutive evenings. 'No other publication in the American 20th century,' the journalism historian Kathy Roberts Forde has written, 'was so widely circulated, republished, discussed, and venerated.' Tanimoto, boosted to celebrity by Hersey's reporting, made speaking tours of the US. By the end of 1949, he had visited 256 cities. Like Einstein, he pleaded for world government. World government: it seems now like a wild utopia. Yet an astonishing number of people - responsible, sober people - felt it to be the only way of preventing more Hiroshimas. Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee both supported the idea. In France, Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus championed it. France's postwar constitution provided for the 'limitations of sovereignty' a future world state might require. So did Italy's. Even in the US, which stood to lose its nuclear monopoly and global supremacy, support for a world state hovered between a third and a half in opinion polls. 'World Government shall come - this is practically the consensus in this generation,' wrote the University of Chicago's chancellor; he even convened a committee to draft its constitution. When candidates in the 1948 elections were asked if they favoured a global government with direct jurisdiction over individuals and peacekeeping powers, 57% said yes, including John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon. In 1946, the movie star Ronald Reagan donated $200 to the cause. Such enthusiasm, however, counted for little in the face of geopolitics. Rising tensions between Washington and Moscow erased the possibility of global government. Still, they didn't change the fact: across the west, leading thinkers felt nuclear weapons to be so dangerous that they required, in Churchill's words, remoulding 'the relationships of all men of all nations' so that 'international bodies by supreme authority may give peace on earth and justice among men'. For Albert Einstein, a world state was 'the only one way out': it was either that or annihilation. Yet the world state never came, and neither did another nuclear war. One of the most surprising and important facts of modern history is a quiet one: in the 76 years since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, not a single nuclear weapon has been detonated in anger. Most weapons don't work like that. Poison gas is one of the few other military technologies that, despite its effectiveness, has been shunned - the first world war was a gas war, but the second world war mostly wasn't. Yet even chemical weapons have seen intermittent use, as by Iraq in the 1980s or Syria in 2013. By contrast, the number of nuclear weapons used since 1945 is zero. Why? The conventional explanation is deterrence. The very thing that terrified Oppenheimer about nuclear weapons - that they made attacking easy and defending nearly impossible - meant that any country nuking a similarly armed foe would have to expect a counterstrike. 'Because catastrophic outcomes of nuclear exchanges are easy to imagine, leaders of states will shrink in horror from initiating them,' the political scientist Kenneth Waltz argued. This logic led Waltz to a counterintuitive position: nuclear proliferation might be good. It's not just that nuclear weapons deter nuclear weapons, it's that they deter major wars in general by making the risks too high. The greater the number of states with nuclear arms, the argument goes, the less likely we are to see violence on the scale of the two world wars. Conflicts have indeed become smaller since 1945. And although there have been border skirmishes between nuclear states - China and the USSR in 1969, India and Pakistan more recently - there haven't been full wars. The bomb 'gave peace to Europe', the nuclear physicist Abdul Qadeer Khan argued. Khan led Pakistan's nuclear programme starting in the 1970s and then transferred nuclear technologies to Iran, North Korea and Libya in the 1980s and 1990s. His active role in proliferation horrified many, but Khan felt that Pakistan's acquisition of nuclear weapons (it tested its first in 1998) had saved it 'from many wars'. By this grim reasoning, we might celebrate the fact that nearly half of humanity now lives in countries with nuclear weapons (and mourn Ukraine's decision in the 1990s to destroy its warheads). Yet central to Waltz's deterrence theory was that the 'catastrophic outcomes' of nuclear war were 'easy to imagine'. For Waltz, who served in Japan in the immediate aftermath of the second world war, no imagination was necessary. Others needed help. This is why John Hersey's Hiroshima article and Kiyoshi Tanimoto's speaking tours were so important: they turned nuclear war from an abstraction into a reality. It was a reality many lived with daily. Today, telling schoolchildren to hide under their desks if a hydrogen bomb strikes seems quaintly unhinged (though, actually, it's good advice). But besides whatever trauma they wrought, preparedness drills like that created a widely shared nuclear consciousness. People regularly envisioned themselves in the position of the Hiroshima survivors. And if they needed help, such films as On the Beach (1959, US), The Day the Earth Caught Fire (1961, UK), The Last War (1961, Japan) and The Day After (1983, US but broadcast globally) vividly dramatised what a nuclear war would be like. 'Is it possible never to think about nuclear weapons?' asked the novelist Martin Amis in the 1980s. 'The man with the cocked gun in his mouth may boast that he never thinks about the cocked gun. But he tastes it, all the time.'. In the same decade, the psychiatrist Robert Lifton assessed the 'psychic toll' such nuclear dread had taken. Hiroshima and Nagasaki weren't just historical events, he argued, they were psychological ones, with rippling consequences. Living with the threat of annihilation threw 'all relationships' into question. How could children trust their parents to keep them safe or churches provide spiritual continuity in such a world? Lifton attributed the rise of divorce, fundamentalism and extremism to the 'radical futurelessness' the bomb had engendered. Maybe one could dismiss the fallout shelters as theatre and the films as fiction. But then there were the bomb tests - great belches of radioactivity that previewed the otherworldly dangers of nuclear weapons. By 1980, the nuclear powers had run 528 atmospheric tests, raising mushroom clouds everywhere from the Pacific atoll of Kiritimati to the Chinese desert. A widely publicised 1961 study of 61,000 baby teeth collected in St Louis showed that children born after the first hydrogen bombs were tested had markedly higher levels of the carcinogen strontium-90, a byproduct of the tests, despite being some 1,500km away from the closest test site. Unsurprisingly, nuclear tests stoked resistance. In 1954, a detonation by the US at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific got out of hand, irradiating the inhabited atoll of Rongelap and an unfortunate Japanese tuna fishing boat. When the boat's sickened crew returned to Japan, pandemonium erupted. Petitions describing Japan as 'thrice victimised by nuclear bombs' and calling for a ban collected tens of millions of signatures. Ishiro Honda, a film director who'd seen the Hiroshima damage firsthand, made a wildly popular film about a monster, Gojira, awakened by the nuclear testing. Emitting 'high levels of H-bomb radiation', Gojira attacks a fishing boat and then breathes fire on a Japanese city. Gojira - or Godzilla, as he's known in English - wasn't the only one awakened by the 1954 Bikini test. The test put Hiroshima back in the spotlight and raised the profile of its survivors. In 1955, Kiyoshi Tanimoto brought 25 women, the 'Hiroshima Maidens', to the US for reconstructive surgery. He appeared before 15 40 million viewers on the television show This Is Your Life and recounted his ordeal the day Hiroshima was attacked. (In an agonising moment, he was then made to shake hands with a surprise guest, a drunken Robert A Lewis, one of the two pilots who had bombed it.) As the anti-nuclear movement spread, 'Hiroshima' became less an unfortunate event in Japan's past than a semi-sacred one in world history, to be commemorated by morally serious people no matter their nationality. Tanimoto promoted 'Hiroshima Day' and by the early 1960s there were protests and memorials on that day throughout the world. Denmark alone held demonstrations in 45 towns in 1963. By then, Hiroshima occupied a similar place in public memory to Auschwitz, the other avatar of the unspeakable. The resemblance ran deep. Both terms identified specific events within the broader violence of the second world war - highlighting the Jews among Hitler's victims, and the atomic bomb victims among the many Japanese who were bombed - and marked them as morally distinct. Both Hiroshima and Auschwitz had been the site of 'holocausts' (indeed, early writers more often used that term to describe atomic war than European genocide). And both Hiroshima and Auschwitz sent forth a new type of personage: the 'survivor', a hallowed individual who had borne witness to a historically unique horror. What Elie Wiesel did to raise the stature of Europe's survivors, Tanimoto did for Japan's. In their hands, Hiroshima and Auschwitz shared a message: never forget, never again. Yet the analogy was imperfect. The European Holocaust was the work of many hands. Mass killing, ordered from on high, had to be carried out by countless willing executioners, who snatched the victims from their homes, stuffed them on to trains, kept them in camps, shot them, gassed them and disposed of their corpses. By contrast, the nuclear apparatus, once in place, could be set into motion by a handful of men in only a few minutes. This also meant, the world soon realised, that another Hiroshima could come by accident. The murder of Europe's Jews was many things, but it wasn't inadvertent. In nuclear standoffs, a plane crash, system malfunction or miscalibrated threat could all plausibly trigger annihilation. Nuclear standoffs are dangerous by design. As in the game of chicken, the point is to set off on a collision course and frighten your opponent into swerving first. 'Fill the nuclear glass to the brim,' Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev advised his colleagues, 'but don't pour the last drop.' Such brinksmanship requires leaders to quell their doubts, possibly even to convince themselves that they're willing to see the glass spill over. Perhaps some are. 'The whole idea is to kill the bastards,' said US general Thomas Power, when presented in 1960 with a nuclear plan designed to minimise casualties. 'Look. At the end of the war, if there are two Americans and one Russian, we win.' This is the man who led the US Strategic Air Command - responsible for its nuclear bombs and missiles - during the Cuban missile crisis. Generals like Power, tasked with winning wars, pressed often for pre-emptive strikes. Yet they were fortunately overruled. Deterrence is surely one reason why, but memory played an important part, too. At key moments, decision-makers vividly imagined what would happen if they fired their weapons. They knew what nuclear aftermath looked like. Even Truman, who had initially considered the bombing of Hiroshima 'the greatest thing in history', found cause for restraint. When the UN forces became stalemated in the Korean war, their commander Douglas MacArthur requested 'atomic capability', later explaining that he'd wanted to drop 'between 30 and 50 atomic bombs'. Although Truman readied nuclear weapons, he fired MacArthur and declined to use them. Why? Looking back, Truman complained of his 'locally minded' field generals who couldn't grasp what going nuclear would have meant. It would have meant an escalating war destroying cities containing millions of 'innocent women, children and noncombatants', Truman imagined. Truman 'just could not' drop the bombs, he wrote. And, he added, 'I know I was right.' Truman's successor, Dwight Eisenhower, felt the same. He built up his country's nuclear arsenal, but when his military advisers urged a preventative attack on the Soviet Union, he refused. He'd seen war, and he could easily envision a nuclear conflict. It would mean, he told them, a 'great area from the Elbe to Vladivostok and down through south-east Asia torn up and destroyed without government, without its communications, just an area of starvation and disaster'. He couldn't do it, either. Such familiarity with war's horrors proved essential in the Cuban missile crisis. The US placement of nuclear missiles in Turkey, followed by the Soviet placement of them in Cuba, brought the two powers terrifyingly close to war. But after a series of escalating threats, Kennedy's Soviet counterpart Khrushchev changed the tone with a frantic, personal appeal. 'I have participated in two wars and know that war ends when it has rolled through cities and villages, everywhere sowing death and destruction,' he wrote. Kennedy, as a fellow 'military man' who had also seen combat (Khrushchev mentioned this twice), would 'understand perfectly what terrible forces' could be unleashed. Kennedy did understand, and he veered away from what he called the 'final failure'. Yet even as Kennedy and Khrushchev were de-escalating their dangerous confrontation, a 'far more dangerous' one was developing at sea, the late historian Martin Sherwin has argued. Its resolution suggests just how important experiential knowledge has been in keeping disaster at bay. The situation involved a Cuba-bound Soviet submarine, carrying a nuclear warhead as powerful as the one that had decimated Hiroshima. The submarine, out of radio contact for days, had missed all the hasty diplomacy between Kennedy and Khrushchev. And so, when the sub's captain found himself beneath a US warship, he refused to surface when signalled. Instead, he stayed submerged while the US sailors grew more aggressive in their signalling. One skipper tried the unauthorised and reckless tactic of dropping grenades on the sub. The explosions were terrifying, and the Soviet captain understandably assumed the war was on. He ordered the torpedo readied. 'We're gonna blast them now! We will die, but we will sink them all - we will not become the shame of the fleet,' the ship's radio officer remembered him shouting. Firing the first nuclear weapon since Nagasaki at the US navy near Cuba at the height of the missile crisis would have almost certainly triggered nuclear retaliation. 'This was not only the most dangerous moment of the cold war,' believed Kennedy aide and historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr, 'It was the most dangerous moment in human history.' The disaster was prevented by a Soviet officer, Vasily Arkhipov, who by chance had been assigned to travel with the submarine. Fifteen months earlier, he'd served aboard a nuclear-powered submarine whose reactor coolant system had failed, exposing the crew to radiation and killing 22 of his 138 shipmates. 'He'd seen with his own eyes what radiation did to people,' his wife told a historian. 'This tragedy was the reason he would say no to nuclear war.' Now facing the likelihood of war in the Caribbean, Arkhipov talked the enraged captain down. It was astonishing luck: the submarine poised to start a nuclear war randomly had aboard one of the few individuals on the planet with recent experience of nuclear disaster. The ability to clearly remember and imagine nuclear war's consequences had been, once again, essential to averting them. In 1985, John Hersey returned to Hiroshima for the 40th anniversary of the bombing. He came to commemorate the past, but he found it fading. The survivors, on average, were now 62. Two of the six people he had profiled in his article were dead. Kiyoshi Tanimoto was still alive, but he was over 70 and retired. 'His memory, like the world's, was getting spotty,' Hersey wrote. By then, the above-ground nuclear tests had stopped (the achievement of decades of antinuclear activism and treaties). Apocalyptic movies continued, but more often featuring zombies, aliens, intelligent machines, diseases or climate change than nuclear catastrophe. Hiroshima's resonance, which once matched Auschwitz's, was growing muffled. Today, knowledge of the Holocaust is kept alive by more than 100 museums and memorials, including in such unexpected countries as Cuba, Indonesia and Taiwan. But there is no comparable memory industry outside of Japan to remind people of nuclear war. The result is a profound generational split, evident in nearly every family in a nuclear state. My father, born a month after Hiroshima was bombed, remembers going to a concert during the Cuban missile crisis 'wondering if I would survive to the end'. My mother had constant nightmares of nuclear war. By contrast, I was born the year the atmospheric testing stopped, and such thoughts never crossed my mind. The extent of my nuclear consciousness was the hours I spent playing a video game called Duke Nukem. That game debuted in 1991, the year the cold war ended and Mikhail Gorbachev declared that 'the risk of a global nuclear war has practically disappeared'. We should feel relief, but the dispelling of dread has made it hard for many to take nuclear war seriously. 'I hear people talk about nuclear weapons,' arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis told me recently, 'and it's just so divorced from reality.' They've become 'dead metaphors', Lewis feels, lacking the concreteness to disturb our thoughts or constrain our behaviours. With nuclear threats far from mind, voters seem more tolerant of reckless politicians. Donald Trump, a case in point, has made outrageous threats, praised his own 'unpredictability' in nuclear affairs and suggested using nuclear bombs against hurricanes ('you could hear a gnat fart in that meeting', a source told Axios). Yet in the energetic discussion about the risks of Trump's running for president in 2024 and winning, nuclear issues are far from central. Nor is it only Trump. The nine nuclear states have had an impressive string of norm-breakers among their recent leaders, including Trump, Vladimir Putin, Narendra Modi, Kim Jong-un and Benjamin Netanyahu. With such erratic men talking wildly and tearing up rulebooks, it's plausible that one of them might be provoked to break the ultimate norm: don't start a nuclear war. Caution does not seem in abundance nowadays. Invading Ukraine, Russia turned Chernobyl into a battlefield and recklessly shelled Europe's largest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia. The Zaporizhzhia attack unsurprisingly set part of the site aflame. It was 'the first time in history' that a nuclear plant had been attacked, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy pointed out. 'If there is an explosion, it is the end of everything.' But how guided are leaders by such fears? In the past 20 years, the US has pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and two of the three main treaties restraining its arms race with Russia (the third is in bad shape). Meanwhile, China has been developing aggressive new weapons. In 2019, India made an airstrike in Pakistan, the first time its planes crossed the military border in Kashmir - known as the Line of Control - since either state acquired nuclear weapons. India has 'stopped the policy of getting scared of Pakistan's threats', its prime minister, Modi, declared. India has the 'mother of nuclear bombs' and its arsenal is 'not being kept for Diwali'. The cost of the shredded norms and torn-up treaties may be paid in Ukraine. Russia invested heavily in its nuclear arsenal after the cold war; it now has the world's largest. The worse the war in Ukraine goes, the more Putin might be tempted to reach for a tactical nuclear weapon to signal his resolve. Already, Russia has threatened nuclear war multiple times, and yet Nato countries increase their aid to Ukraine. The 'current generation of Nato politicians', Russia's exasperated ambassador in Washington has complained, 'does not take the nuclear threat seriously'. Maybe they don't. Hiroshima lies just outside their collective memory. The oldest of the 30 Nato leaders, Joe Biden, was two years old in August 1945. The youngest, prime minister Dritan Abazovic of Montenegro, may not even remember the cold war, as he was five when the Soviet Union collapsed. That is what time does. Traumas fade, fortunately for us all. It is a profound achievement - though surely aided by luck - that no nuclear war has refreshed our memories since 1945. We should rejoice, too, that the looming dread engulfing past generations has largely dissipated. This is what we want nuclear war to be: an archaic practice, relegated safely to the past. But we can't drive nuclear war to extinction by ignoring it. Instead, we must dismantle arsenals, strengthen treaties and reinforce antinuclear norms. Right now, we're doing the opposite. And we're doing it just at the time when those who have most effectively testified to nuclear war's horrors - the survivors - are entering their 90s. Our nuclear consciousness is badly atrophied. We're left with a world full of nuclear weapons but emptying of people who understand their consequences.

A hundred Canadian dollars had been hidden somewhere near the town's harbour, it said. The following days brought more clues for other locations. Some made sense. Most were maddeningly vague. A week later, the town of 17,000 has become gripped by a mysterious horror-themed treasure hunt, with thousands of local people grappling with a succession of clues - and the promise of a cash prize. 'I don't think anything of this magnitude has ever happened in Miramichi,' said Adams Robichaud, a high school student. 'And we just absolutely love it.' Robichaud has been unsuccessful in his attempts to find the money. But like others in the town - where many have felt stifled by Covid public health restrictions - he has been swept up in the excitement of the hunt. The game is run by a shadowy figure calling themselves Roman Dungarvan, and claiming to be a descendant of an Irish cook robbed and murdered at a nearby logging camp in the late 19th century. According to local lore, the cook's body was buried in a shallow grave in the nearby forest, but on the night of his death, the air was filled with the 'most dreadful whoops and screams anyone has ever heard'. The men fled the next morning - and the legend of the Dungarvan Whooper hasfascinated residents ever since. On the Facebook page Miramichi Mystery Machine, the younger Dungarvan posts messages with a distorted voice and the image of a hooded figure. Many of the competition's locations have a horror theme: one clue took the treasure hunters to French Cove, supposedly haunted by the headless nun. Another was the poster for the 1980 slasher film Prom Night. (The money that night was eventually located in an abandoned school building.) Tim Sutton, a local TikToker, found himself frustratingly close to one of the stashes of money. 'I was wearing my pizza costume - something I do for TikTok videos - and searched for nearly seven hours that night. I didn't find it,' he said. 'But it's not about the money. It's more about the hunt and getting out in the fresh air and kind of making new friends.' A few days later, Sutton successfully solved a different clue, and received the money via bitcoin transfer. Dungarvan has remained eerily close to the action, giving hints and directions to treasure hunters in real time.. 'One time he posted, 'Tim Sutton, you're going the wrong way.' ,' the TikToker said. 'Another night he said, 'Man in the orange shirt - you're close.' He's watching you.' Despite its forbidding persona, the Dungarvan character also has a softer side, reminding treasure hunters to socially distance when they met at a local Dairy Queen - and to tip cashiers. (Staff at a fast food restaurant told the Guardian that event brought in $50 in tips). On the Facebook group, residents have enthused about their new shared obsession. One woman described spending a rare day outside with her husband and children. 'They weren't glued to electronics - they were making memories,' she wrote. So far, six prizes of $100 have been discovered and Dungarvan says that this Friday - Friday 13th - at 7pm, the prize will be C$1,300. A posting for the event features an image from the Friday the 13th horror films, a warning that anyone with a heart condition should not participate - but also a plea for participants to respect the speed limit. Sutton admits the game could be a ruse put on by some local businesses or even the city. But he's already started trying to guess where the final payout could be hidden, drawing on his girlfriend's extensive knowledge of horror movies. 'There's so many different horror legends here in Miramichi that it's hard to know where to start,' said Sutton. 'But like everyone else, I know I'll be ready, sitting in my car on Friday the 13th at 7pm - and ready for anything.'", "13c00e4f8d53dd5dc2786ec9b621918b24ac4d1786f35c7722f92b1d": "Hello Fight to Vote readers, Every Tuesday night for the last year or so, Crystal Mason has had trouble sleeping. On Wednesday mornings, the Texas court of criminal appeals, the state's highest criminal court, usually issues its ruling. And since March of last year, Mason has been waiting for a ruling from the court that could change her life. She's been appealing a five-year prison sentence for voting a provisional ballot in 2016. Mason was ineligible to vote at the time because she was on federal supervised release - which is like probation - for a tax felony. Texas prohibits anyone from voting while they are serving a criminal sentence, but she says - and probation officials have confirmed - that no one told her she was ineligible. Yesterday, Mason, who is 47-years-old and raised seven kids and has six grandchildren, got the phone call she's been anxiously waiting for. In an 8-1 ruling, the court told a lower court it had to reconsider the case to determine whether Mason actually knew she was ineligible to vote when she cast a ballot. It was a partial, but far from final, victory for Mason. I've been following Mason's case for the last few years, and on Wednesday, I spoke with Mason hours after the ruling. We talked about about her case and why she thinks it's struck a nerve across the US. How are you feeling, and what was it like to get the news this morning? I was at work and Kim [Mason's lawyer] called me ... She said the decision came in. I just started to panic, I started to sweat, like nervous, like, 'What's going on, Kim?' She let me know that it's going back to the second court of appeals and they have to prove intent. Like where I really knew that I was committing a crime. And I feel like that's a good step. That's a good step right there. If you go off facts and facts alone, Sam, you know that the supervised release officer testified on the stand and said no one told me [I couldn't vote] in the supervised release office. Then I received paperwork in my judgment and commitment, and in black and white, it's not there. And then you can see it in my supervised release information, it was not there. I think that the criminal court of appeals asked them something very important. That needs to be ... that's the whole case, right there. I'm very happy that they did that. But I know this is not over. You were never told, never had any idea, being on federal supervised release, that you couldn't vote in Texas? Absolutely not. I was never told that. I never had any paperwork stating that. I was going by all my conditions of being on supervised release, and I did not see that at all. I do know that as a felon you still have the right to vote. I had no idea that being on supervised release took that right away from me. There's no way ... I'm on track. I got a good job. I'm making decent money. I'm in school. I'm back with my family, my kids, my grandbabies. You wouldn't have ever taken a chance, if there was even a grey line, of me thinking that I was ineligible to vote. I just wouldn't have did that. You just don't. This has been a disaster for me. The jobs that I have lost. Me going back to prison [Mason was ordered to return to federal prison for 10 months for being convicted of a crime while on supervised release], leaving my kids. Me fighting to try to maintain everything. It's been a disaster for me. There have been very significant consequences for you and your family. Can you walk me through what some of those consequences have been? I had to go back to prison. I had three jobs taken away from me. I fought to maintain my house and everything. And I am the provider for my family. You were not a political person in 2016. Not at all. And since then you've become political. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've been doing and what made you get more politically active? If you go back to my first interviews, you'll hear me say 'I'll never vote again. I'll never vote again.' And that was it. And I realized that's exactly what they wanted me to do. That's exactly what they wanted me to say. I realized that no, I have to let everybody know that what I had done was an innocent mistake. And I am being prosecuted for an innocent mistake and that is not right. And then I had to let everybody know how important it is to go vote. Because the people that did this to me - the judge, the DA, the prosecutor - they're all elected officials. So this is the reason why it's so important that we get out and vote. And what has your group, Crystal Mason 'The Fight', been focused on? Has it been teaching people about their rights eligibility? Encouraging them to vote? All of the above? All of the above. Educating them on the different types of ballot. We're getting ready to do a town hall. And that's where we're asking different candidates running for different positions to come to my venue and speak to the community. And let us know: who you are and what do you plan on doing if you get the seat you're running for. I've traveled across the country, and almost everywhere I go, people have heard of that woman in Texas who was sentenced to five years in prison for trying to vote. I'm curious why you think your case has resonated so much and caused so much outrage? I think the people see the wrongness. The people that's in the court system, the people that's in a position to do something about it has turned a blind eye on it. I feel that people who hear the story and just really see, they know that I did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. Nothing at all. I filled out a provisional ballot. I'm being sentenced for illegally voting and I never voted. I mean that's wrong right there. There are some people who have said your case is an example of intimidation. Sending a message to Black people, and people who have felony convictions in their past, that you better be really sure you can vote before you try. Do you see it as intimidation? Have you heard from other people who are not going to vote because they heard about what's happened to you? I have heard that. That's because people are scared. They're listening to me, and I tell them 'yep, I'm right here but I'm fighting and it's very wrong.' But people don't want to take a chance. And yes, I do feel like my case is sending a message to the Black and the brown [people]: 'If you dare come to the polls, this could happen to you'. So yes, I do feel like it's sending a message. It is a scare tactic. And that's not right, that's not right at all. So that's the reason I'm out here speaking to people and telling people how important it is to vote. And actually you voted in the primary, a couple months ago [Mason's supervised release expired last year, allowing her to vote in Texas]. What was that like for you to go back to the voting booth and cast a ballot when you were eligible? It was very exciting. I was with my family, and the things that I didn't know [before], I knew. So once I finished up with my ballot, I automatically went to go help my mother. And of course I got stopped and they said, 'Oh no, you can't.' I told her ... I can help her. I had to fill out a form, and they notarized it and everything. I turned around and I went to help my mom and I helped my niece. So I felt real good about being knowledgable about being able to help them through that ballot. Is there anything you hope people take away from your case? What do you hope people will learn from your case and take away from it. The importance of voting. Everybody that has something to do with my case are elected officials.", "1fb101e274119464af40c4fc66276b755bbfc65e9a66853b247234d8": "With hindsight, the environmental activist Helen Steel, a key figure in the 1990s McLibel case, can see that her life with John Dines was suspiciously idyllic.  When they met, at a London Greenpeace meeting in the late 1980s, she was spending her free time protesting against nuclear weapons at Greenham Common, or staying in mining villages supporting striking miners. Soon he was enthusiastically joining her on hunt saboteur trips to disrupt grouse shoots in Yorkshire, or on demonstrations against the poll tax, and spending his weekends with her, helping to campaign against the environmental record of McDonald's. It was only decades after their relationship ended that she began to understand that they got on so well because Dines was using a battery of grooming techniques perfected by colleagues in an undercover police division. The undercover officers in Dines's unit presented themselves as vulnerable and alone in the world; often they would say they were recently bereaved or estranged from their families, preying on the women's good nature, inviting their sympathy and love. The first time Steel went to the pub with Dines, he said his father had died very suddenly. A few months later, he told her his mother had also died unexpectedly; he said he was short of money, so she lent him the funds to fly to New Zealand for the funeral. She began to feel sorry for him and somehow these feelings evolved into a more complicated sense of attachment. Steel was just 23 when they met and was initially surprised that a man five years older than her should be so interested, but they seemed to have a lot in common, particularly their politics, so when he asked her out, eventually she agreed. They found a flat in London and moved in together. They had wonderful holidays in the Outer Hebrides and at Camber Sands. All the while he was telling her he wanted to buy a small house in the countryside with his inheritance, somewhere he could dig a duck pond for her and they could settle down and have six children. 'We got on so well, sharing many of the same interests and never having arguments ... Life with John was idyllic,' she writes in Deep Deception, an extraordinary account of how undercover officers from the Metropolitan police's special demonstration squad (SDS) deceived dozens of women into fake relationships, co-written with four other women who were similarly ensnared. 'All of us began by thinking that the men had in some way genuinely cared about us - even after we discovered that they were undercover officers,' she says now, describing how her anger mounted steadily as she researched and wrote the book. 'As we talked through what happened to us, we saw so many patterns; it really rammed it home that there weren't any genuine moments - they were purely manipulative and abusive.' Throughout the time they were together, Dines was married to someone else; his parents were alive and well. When his deployment was over, he left a note on the kitchen table telling her that he needed some space and abruptly disappeared. There can be no clearer example of misogyny within the Met than the undercover police division's treatment of these women, who were duped into relationships by officers who used them to construct convincing alter egos, to mask the surveillance work they were doing on small, mostly left-leaning and non-violent protest groups. 'I still don't think the police get it. That was our purpose in writing this book - we wanted to expose the institutional sexism that allowed these relationships to happen and to stop more women being abused by officers. It's very easy for an individual's experience to be written off as a glitch, or just the responsibility of an individual officer, but the strength of us writing our story together - you start to see patterns, and it is the patterns that demonstrate that this was a systemic problem,' she says. Even people who think they are familiar with the broad outlines of the undercover cop scandal will be astonished by the contents of Deep Deception. The book weaves together the women's experiences chronologically, revealing in horrifying detail how they were each tricked into relationships. One of the women lived for five years with a man with whom she hoped to have children, before he disappeared unexpectedly and without trace; it turned out he had been married with three young children throughout the time they had been together. Another had a relationship stretching more than seven years, while another from their group had two children with an officer, believing that he had genuine feelings for her. 'The betrayal and the Orwellian surveillance behind it have devastated lives,' the introduction notes. But the book is a triumphant exercise in exploding the women's status as victims; it goes on to describe their success in subsequently exposing the cynical and sordid full extent of the spy cops operation. Steel is not sure whether she was selected randomly as a way of giving Dines credibility within the activist community, or if she was targeted because of her involvement in the McDonald's campaign. Shortly after they began their relationship in the early 90s, she was walking with Dines back to his flat when she was served with a libel writ by McDonald's over a leaflet she had helped produce highlighting the environmental damage caused by the burger chain; she now believes he must have been involved in helping organise for the writ to be served. The case would become the longest-running legal battle in English history. Steel and her co-defendant, Dave Morris (an unemployed postal worker), became famous globally for their dogged refusal to apologise in the face of McDonald's multimillion-pound lawsuit. As Steel prepared her defence, Dines would obligingly pick her up from meetings with the young lawyer who was helping her - a newly qualified Keir Starmer - enabling him to hear all about the defence arguments as he drove her home. Later it would emerge that another undercover officer from the same SDS unit had helped draft the offending leaflet. 'They targeted anyone with a desire to protest against the status quo, anyone attempting to hold the government or big business to account. Only a handful of far-right groups were infiltrated among the many hundreds of leftwing ones,' she says. 'A large part of their function seemed to be to protect corporate interests.'This riveting book exposes repeat patterns of abusive behaviour by the undercover cops, revealing how the men used well-honed strategies for building up relationships and jettisoning them at the end of the deployment. The officers were adept at a method known as 'mirroring': subtly latching on to things the women were interested in and later declaring that they, too, shared those same passions - the same music, politics, books, commitment to vegetarianism. It becomes clear that they were passing on tips and guidance to each other on how to manipulate the women they were using to provide a front for their undercover work. The undercover officers had vans and flexible work that made them available for transporting people to and from activist meetings - allowing them to eavesdrop on plans. The freelance nature of their pretend jobs (as gardeners, carpenters or delivery drivers) also permitted them to disappear for protracted stretches to spend time with their real families. They exited suddenly, after announcing they were having breakdowns and needed space; they disappeared to South Africa or the US and appeared to be untraceable. The women were devastated at the abrupt end of relationships, upset for themselves, but also worried about the welfare of the defenceless, lonely men they had loved. Steel's story has been written about previously (not least in the excellent Undercover, by the Guardian journalists Rob Evans and Paul Lewis), but the extent to which her life was messed up by the decision of Dines to dupe her into a relationship is laid bare in this book. It is a shocking and at times painful-to-read series of dizzying, life-shattering deceptions. For a while, Steel had some residual affection for Dines; it was hard to believe that there had been nothing genuine in his behaviour towards her over the two years they had lived together. Subsequently, she has met more than two dozen other women similarly abused and her gaze has hardened. The Met continues to insist that these relationships were unsanctioned misdemeanours committed by individual rogue officers, but Steel believes this is nonsense. 'We could see that what had seemed like heart-wrenching stories told by the officers at the time were so similar they could only have come through shared practice. It was chilling,' she says. Four of the women behind the book have chosen to remain anonymous, but Steel long ago abandoned any attempt to box off this chunk of her life. She writes with powerful rage about the women's continuing battle for justice. 'We were often portrayed as victims with no agency and we wanted to show that it was our detective work that uncovered this scandal, and to show that fighting back against those abuses was an empowering experience,' she says.Although there have been public apologies and financial settlements for some of the women, the book highlights how energetically the police continues to obstruct the women's campaign to get answers. In a post #MeToo era, at a time when the Met is facing the fallout from its handling of Sarah Everard's death, it seems remarkable that the force is resisting these women's requests for disclosure about the details of their cases, by refusing to release the files on them. 'These are akin to Stasi files. All kinds of information was put down in these police files. It is grossly intrusive. There's no justification in a democracy for keeping those kinds of files,' Steel says. It is particularly startling to register how consistently the women's experiences have been trivialised in the years since they exposed the unit's actions. A judge hearing their case in 2013 described the police officers as 'cads'. Another judge, Mr Justice Tugendhat, hearing a different part of the case that year, made a peculiar reference to James Bond to provide context for the behaviour of the police, arguing that the fictional spy's behaviour showed how the intelligence services had for years used 'officers to form personal relationships of an intimate sexual nature ... in order to obtain information or access'. The women were treated dismissively during a home affairs select committee hearing. Writing in the Daily Mail in 2014, Richard Littlejohn derided the women as 'an assortment of unwashed dopey birds who slept with undercover officers'. Most significantly, an attempt to prosecute the officers for rape and sexual assault failed in 2014, when the Crown Prosecution Service concluded that there was 'insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction'. The CPS decision not to prosecute the officers was 'absolutely outrageous; totally sexist,' Steel says. 'There is no way that we would have consented to these relationships had we known who these men really were and what their purpose was in our lives.' The deception made the women think they were going mad; most were later diagnosed with serious psychological injuries including post-traumatic stress, extreme anxiety, depression and panic attacks. Steel discovered in 1994, through impressive, forensic investigation, that Dines, whom she knew as John Barker, had stolen the identity of a child who had died at eight of leukaemia; some time later, she realised that he was a member of the SDS. Writing the book meant she had to go through diaries and letters from the time of the relationship; she was shocked by how unkind he had been in his treatment of her, particularly the manner of his departure, when he left her and returned repeatedly over several months, telling her he loved her and feeding her new lies about his grief for his fictitiously dead parents. Rereading the letters 'really struck home just how abusive and manipulative he was. And that made me really angry; it was as if he set out to destroy my sanity.' Dines, who later moved to Australia, has never explained his behaviour. Steel managed to track him down in 2016 and speak to him at Sydney airport (the mobile phone footage of that brief meeting is worth watching, as a fleeting insight into Dines' callous dismissal of what he has done).  'As far as we know, not a single one of them has faced any consequences for their actions, not even the docking of their pensions,' she says. The impact on the women, however, has been profound. Steel's faith in her judgment was shattered, so it took a long time before she was able to have another relationship, which meant by the time she started trying to have a family it was difficult. She had seven miscarriages and was ultimately unable to have children. 'It has severely affected our ability to trust other people, or to form intimate relationships again. You can't compensate for that,' she says, noting that even the state compensation system does not see the world from a woman's perspective, being more inclined to focus on loss of earnings. She is unimpressed by the effusive police apology issued in 2015, which she thinks does not sit well with the persistent refusal to release the women's files so that they can properly understand why they were targeted and the nature of the information held on them. 'There is a tension between them claiming it should never have happened and saying they think it's appalling, and refusing to tell us the truth about the extent of it and who knew,' she says. In response to the book, the Met reiterated its regret, stating: 'Undercover policing has changed significantly with independent judicial oversight of all operations, and past events highlighted in this book in no way reflect modern-day undercover policing. We recognise the hurt and distress caused to the authors of this book. The actions of undercover officers who deceived these women into sexual relationships were totally unacceptable.' A public inquiry into undercover policing has been running since 2015, but progress has been severely hampered by police requests for secrecy. The hearings restarted this week, however the sessions relating to the women's experiences are not expected to begin until next year. 'The public inquiry has been bending over backwards to protect the privacy and feelings of the former undercover officers. There is no concern for our privacy and our right to know,' Steel says. 'We all want answers. If the police want to raid someone's house, they have to apply for a warrant and they have to set out the reasons why they need to search the house. But with these relationships, no warrants needed to be applied for. They were living in our houses and they had access to everything we had in our homes; they had access to the contents of our heads. They could ask us whatever questions they wanted and we would answer - believing they were our trusted partners, not an undercover cop trying to get information. It was disgusting and inhumane abuse.' Deep Deception is published by Ebury Spotlight (PS20). To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

It was 2013 and I had picked a grassy patch near a bridle path, where I listened to the wind rustling through the trees as raindrops bounced off my nylon roof. I had always assumed something like this was going to happen to me. It had felt almost inevitable for years. When viewed in isolation, my journey to the streets seems entirely of my own making. I had racked up considerable rent arrears, I was drinking heavily and I had left my flat without being evicted. I went to live in a tent and on random sofas for a few weeks, before moving into a charitable homeless hostel. Surely it was all my fault? I wish I could say I was forced on to the streets by an unscrupulous landlord, addiction to hard drugs or something more dramatic, but sloth, shame and overwhelming paranoia were what did it. It was as if I needed to check out, to yield to a tide that was out of my control, to let it wash me up where it wanted. But the more I dug into my journey, the more it became clear that I had been failed repeatedly along the way - from the special-education boarding school to the care home, the police, the precarious jobs and the effects of austerity. Some will be surprised that I am writing this - alongside a book - at all. People with my background don't normally make it into print. But this is my story. In 1997, when I was 11, my key worker entered my classroom and presented me with a small, green paper parcel, which she unfurled, revealing a thick, white powder. I leaned forward and gathered as much of it as I could with my tongue, making sure not to miss a speck. I was told the bitter taste in my mouth was going to make me better; make me good. The classroom was in a special-education boarding school - let's call it Dippydale - for children with learning, emotional and behavioural difficulties. I was there because, since as soon as I could form memories, I had been told there was something wrong with me - and they had a point. The psychiatrist who diagnosed me with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when I was seven didn't need to strain his diagnostic skills. During our first session, I did my best Spider-Man impression on his bookshelves when I was supposed to be arranging a series of simple pictures into logical sequences. I burned all my bridges with mainstream education, so, at 11, I ended up at Dippydale. The school was in the middle of nowhere, on the foreboding West Pennine Moors. Emotional outbursts, fights and restraints routinely disrupted teaching. The soundtrack to the school's corridors was: 'Get the fuck off me, now!' The favoured restraint was known as the B-52. It involved lining up three chairs next to each other and plonking an unfortunate child on the middle chair, with two members of staff flanking them, locking the child's arms across their laps with one hand and pushing the child's head down with the other. It was named after the bomber presumably because the contorted child resembled a plane. Restraints were a rite of passage at the school and I soon had my turn. I had enuresis (I wet the bed). There were four boys to a room in the boarding house, so it was impossible to hide this embarrassing problem. My key worker at the time - let's call him Mr Lanky - thought he could remedy this by waltzing into my bedroom every morning before my roommates had awoken to ask me if I was dry - only he would spell it out, as if that would keep it secret. 'Are you D-R-Y?' he would ask. We might have been div kids, but we could still spell - and smell. I didn't need excuses to distract myself from schoolwork and behave badly, but the bullying gave me some anyway. My first B-52 came after I refused to go back inside after breaktime over petty frustrations on the football pitch. I was dragged back into the music room by two teachers and restrained. I knew all the lyrics to the school's soundtrack by this point and belted them out with furious gusto: 'Get the fuck off me now, you bastards!' I was so upset and helpless as I sat there, immobilised in pain, that I spat on the floor in frustration. A third teacher, who was standing over me, took a tissue, gathered up my spittle and wiped it over my face. I didn't think much of the restraints at the time; they were like clockwork at school. Now, I perceive them almost as injustices that happened to someone else, a little boy I knew a long time ago. A 2016 study funded by the National Institutes of Health in the US found that ADHD substantially increased the risk of homelessness. The study tracked 134 boys aged between six and 12 diagnosed with ADHD in the 1970s. When they caught up with the boys three decades later, they found that 24% of them had been homeless, more than five times the rate for a control group of neurotypical children. Like me, many homeless adults start on their route to destitution in childhood. According to a 2018 survey conducted by Evolve Housing, a London-based homeless charity, 79% of the 156 participants reported at least one childhood trauma. While Evolve stops short of claiming there is a causal link between childhood trauma and homelessness, it does say there is 'a disproportionally high level of those experiencing homelessness following traumatic childhood experiences'. Even if there is no causal link, I was about to add to the neurological disorder and trauma via a different conduit to homelessness. I never thought I would go into care. It seemed like a horror story, an abstraction exclusive to fictional characters or people in the news. But by the time I reached the front door of my new foster home, my life was spiralling from one catastrophe to the next. This was just the latest one. As well as my disrupted education and bad behaviour, my mum's budding relationship with my new stepdad was adding to tensions at home. He and I now get on. He is my dad, I love him and that's that. But our relationship has been fraught over the years. Dad was an entertaining chastiser. He had a series of greatest hits that could have filled a double-sided compilation album: Now That's What I Call a Bollocking. My all-time favourite was when he told me off for relentlessly teasing my brother on one hyperactive afternoon at my grandma's house: 'Now listen, boy, and listen well!' he growled. 'You're nine years old now; you're halfway to being 18!' He was halfway to being 60 at the time, so by his logic we should have been preparing for his retirement. Looking back, I don't blame my parents. I was a little bastard at the best of times and my parents, who had problems of their own and were offered little support from social services, were not equipped to cope. Children in care are more likely to leave school with fewer qualifications than children who remain at home. They are more likely to be unemployed, to have mental illness and to enter the criminal justice system. It is almost as if the care system trains children for destitution. After a year in the system, I was expelled from Dippydale and finished my secondary education at 15, with no qualifications. In the same year, I had my first run-in with the police. The staff had already lost control of the kids under their charge before I arrived at a claustrophobic children's home in Manchester. Bad behaviour went unpunished or was penalised inconsistently. All this taught us was that we could do what we wanted and there would be no penalties until things got so out of hand that the police had to be called. Then, instead of a grounding or a dock in pocket money, we earned a criminal record. The first time I got nicked, I and a few other kids decided that breaking furniture and shouting abuse at the staff was preferable to going to bed. Aside from exhaustion, police intervention was probably the only thing that would have stopped us that night. But a 999 call could have been avoided if the staff weren't so inconsistent and incompetent. I ended up in handcuffs on several occasions after that, once for breaking a mug. Often the police would come just to make sure we went to bed. The little respect we had for the staff disappeared as soon as they had us criminalised; rebelling against them became our raison d'etre. It all came to a head on one sunny summer afternoon. Lucy, who was 14 and the only girl living at the home, was visited by Hamza, her 18-year-old boyfriend. He was hanging around with her on the front doorstep. Lucy wanted to come back into the unit for a drink, but the staff told her she couldn't come in if Hamza was still on the premises. He refused to go. Lucy shouted obscenities through the letterbox: 'Let me in, you fuckin' dick'eds; it's my house, yeah?' she said, cackling. 'Yo, Danny! Carter! Let us in, man!' Not wanting to miss out on the fun, Carter, the lanky 'top boy' of the unit, and I obliged. Two male staff members were on that day. Let's call them Gramps (he had a white beard) and Titch (he was tiny). Meanwhile, Joyless (she was mean) was manning the office. Titch put his hand on the door to try to keep it shut, but Carter managed to overpower him. Gramps had been blocking my path, but when Carter got the door open, Gramps rushed over to shut it, giving me enough space to slip past him and over the threshold. The staff locked the door behind us and shook their heads in disgust as we flipped them off from outside. Hamza distracted us from tormenting the staff when he produced the gun he had brought along. I don't know if it was real, but it looked real enough, and Hamza got nervous when we turned the barrel on Titch and Gramps through the window. Things went on like this for a while until we grew bored and wanted to come back in. The staff insisted we enter one at a time, but as soon as they opened the door for me to go in, an almighty scuffle broke out as Hamza and Carter attempted to force their way inside with me. Gramps had Hamza in a chokehold, while Carter had Titch in a clinch and was thrusting his knee sharply, relentlessly, into Titch's face. Eventually, Titch crumpled to the floor. Carter then rushed outside and attempted to pick up one of the boulders lying on a flower bed close to the entrance. 'Why aren't you doing anything, you pussy?' he shouted to me as I stood there, frozen. He couldn't lift the boulder and went for a fire extinguisher near the door instead. Hamza had managed to wriggle free before Carter could put the extinguisher to use, but a flurry of punches and kicks followed, then sirens. Carter, Lucy and Hamza fled past me. I was still rooted to the spot, staring in disbelief at Gramps and Titch's unconscious, bloodied bodies. 'C'mon!' Carter shouted as he dragged me away. I found my feet and sprinted after them. The air was filled with deafening sirens - and they were for us. We ran as fast as we could, for as long as we could - longer than we had ever run before. When we stopped - when we could no longer hear sirens - it felt like my whole body had become engorged and my tongue was made of copper. Carter and I watched Hamza and Lucy make their way up a long, dark street with red-brick terrace houses on either side. They stopped at one near the end and were invited in after a brief chat at the front door. Hamza looked at us and shook his head apologetically as he crossed the threshold with Lucy. By now, it was getting dark. The uniformity of the red terraces under the ugly orange streetlamps was the perfect backdrop for our bleak circumstances. 'We could go to my gran's house,' I suggested to Carter. 'Yeah? Where does she live?' he said. 'Greenfield,' I said. Carter managed a laugh. 'Nah. Mission, that.' 'What are we gonna do then?' I asked. 'Go back,' he said. Carter started walking. 'If we go back, we'll get lifted,' I said. 'I'll get lifted. Fuck all's gonna 'appen to you,' he said. 'How do you know?' I asked. 'Because I know! You didn't do owt, did you?'  We didn't talk much on the way home. The adrenaline that kept us on our toes for more than four miles had sapped from our bodies and left cold reality behind. We knew Carter had ruined his life; the slow march home felt like a funeral procession. We arrived back and I knocked on the door as Carter took a seat on the bottom rung of the railings that ran along the front-door steps, the same place where all the drama began. Joyless came to the door with Biker (he commuted by bike from Halifax), a stout thirtysomething care worker for whom no one had much time. Joyless was wearing a look of revulsion as she appeared at the door. 'Just you,' she said to me. I looked back at Carter. 'Told you. Go on,' he said. What began as defiance of the rules, broken curfews, midnight pantry raids and abusive tantrums escalated to criminal damage and grievous bodily harm in a matter of months. It didn't have to be this way. Government guidelines say that the police should not be used to manage low-level behaviour problems or matters that a 'reasonable parent' would not have called the police about. When children go into care, it is invariably because their family situation has broken down. After this happens, the state becomes the parent and is responsible for their welfare. My experience was two decades ago, but criminalisation is still common in the care system. It is not surprising that about 27% of the prison population comprises care-leavers when practically everyone I lived with in care finished their time with a criminal record. Even though Carter, Lucy and I didn't know it yet, our behaviour would shape our futures and make lives embroiled in poverty, crime and destitution almost certain. When I left care, I had already lived at 14 addresses. I would bounce between council flats and bedsits another seven times before I ended up in that tent. Many of the mistakes I have made are my own, but I can't help thinking that if social services had handled my transition to independence better, if readiness - instead of the arbitrariness of age - determined when care leavers could stand on their own two feet, maybe I would have made something of my life sooner. When I was 21, I worked a full-time job and took night classes. In 2010, I made it to university. But I couldn't look after myself. I struggled to budget and keep a routine and was generally disorganised, my attention always anywhere but the present. By the end of my third year, with care support long gone, I was firmly in the grip of mental illness and dependency. My grandparents, to whom I was close, had died over those three years and one of my best friends died suddenly, too; my mother was hospitalised with multiple organ failure; and some of my immediate family members were struggling with substance abuse and were in trouble with the police (one was placed in a psychiatric ward). All of this caused me to withdraw into myself. Towards the end of my degree, in May 2013, I was in thousands of pounds of arrears and became paranoid about debt collectors visiting me. It was this that made me resort to pitching a tent. After 18 months bouncing around the hostel system, I managed to pull myself together enough to complete a master's degree and become a journalist - I have even won a few awards. But if your take from this is that I am living proof that upward mobility is all about grit and determination, then you should know that I am a walking, talking anomaly. Almost everyone I know from the system is damaged. They are off the map, in prison or dead. Things have not improved. According to analysis by WPI Economics for the charities St Mungo's and Homeless Link, spending by English local authorities on homelessness-related activity fell by 27% between 2008-09 and 2017-18. During this time, the number of rough sleepers more than doubled. It is true that people like me are more likely to become homeless at some point in their lives, but the fact is that homelessness can happen to almost anyone. You may have had a perfect paint-by-numbers existence: good schools, straight As, a glowing career, a flourishing social life and a supportive family. Then, one day, you are blindsided by illness, redundancy, a relationship breakdown, a rogue landlord or some other unforeseen circumstance and find yourself on your arse. If we want to end housing insecurity and eliminate endemic homelessness, we must embark on a radical and comprehensive social housebuilding programme. In the past five years, I have lived in four properties across London. One of those was a temporary placement; in two others, I had to leave due to dishonest landlords. At the time of writing, I am living in another box in south-east London. I don't have many possessions and the walls of the box remain pasty and bare. Decorating seems futile. At the back of my mind, I know I can never settle; the next eviction letter is on the horizon and will soon be in my face, propelling me into another frantic race against time to find my next four walls. I worry that I will fail this time, that I will get the letter during a pinch and will have to go through all of this again.

Although Johnson's key guarantee is necessarily a political declaration, as opposed to an international treaty guarantee, the British commitment was of high value at a time of great tension, Anna Wieslander, the Atlantic Council's northern Europe director said on Wednesday. Johnson's visits were designed to reassure the populations of both countries that in practical military defence terms key Nato countries, if not Nato collectively, are committed bilaterally to the Nordic countries' defence if subject to attack or sustained Russian intimidation. The UK statement goes further than any bilateral guarantees made so far by any other Nato country and is designed to cover the potentially vulnerable transition period between Nato membership application and full membership, the point at which Nato's full article 5 collective defence protections kicks in. That transition is perceived as the moment of maximum risk for Stockholm and Helsinki and could last as long as 12 months as each of the 30 Nato states must ratify their membership. In a visit to Washington last week Ann Linde, the Swedish foreign minister, was given a broad security assurance by Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor also promised to back the Nordics' Nato membership when the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, and her Finnish counterpart, Sanna Marin, travelled to Berlin last week. Bjorn Fagersten, senior research fellow at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, said the British offer 'gives an extra layer of assurance in the event of an attack. It is written down and Boris Johnson was quite specific in terms of talking about increased deployments by the military, air force and naval operations.' Wieslander said 'at a time of very high tension in the region, it is of great value, and partly because it builds on what exists already through the agreements made at the time of the setting up of the joint expeditionary force in 2015. It also sends a signal to Russia that a nuclear power is willing to do this. I would expect the US to do something similar.' The declaration could not come in the form of a fully fledged treaty since that might take as long to ratify as Sweden's Nato membership. In a decision that cuts deep into Swedish self-identity, the ruling Social Democrat board will decide on Sunday whether to end 200 years of neutrality, although many say the cooperation between Finland and Sweden with Nato members has been so close it was tantamount to Nato membership. Leftwing critics have said Sweden is behaving like a reindeer in a herd, running in the same direction as the rest.  Fagersten said the meeting of the Social Democrats governing board was 'the key decision point', and predicted the party would join the non-left opposition parties in backing membership. 'The statements from former foreign ministers such as Margot Wallstrom and the fact that Social Democrats have brought forward the decision to coincide with Finland's timetable suggest there will be support.' Asked if he thought Johnson was the best message carrier to take into the Swedish social democratic debate, he said: 'I don't think Brexit or Partygate will affect Sweden's thinking. We have seen that Britain has been pretty supportive of Ukraine from an early stage, and that has increased its credibility. Britain is a pretty popular country here. We would still like you to be EU members, but we cooperate a lot.' Support for Nato membership has not trailed off in Sweden since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. A poll conducted by Demoskop for the daily newspaper Aftonbladet showed support for Nato membership still rising and reaching 61 %. The same organisation's poll published on 20 April showed 57% of Swedes in favour of joining Nato, up from 51% in March. In addition, more than two-thirds of the Finnish parliament, according to surveys, now supports Nato membership. Finland, an EU member, has managed to balance criticism of Russia with a bridge-building role with Moscow, but may find that role harder to play once inside an alliance seen as Russia's enemy. Defence experts are stressing that Sweden could maintain its special role in advocating peace and disarmament by following Norway and Denmark, two founding Nato members, in making a condition of membership a ban on their soil of both nuclear weapons in peacetime and permanent foreign troops. In practice this does not prevent near permanent rotational forces or pre-positioning of supplies. Security service chiefs have been surprised by the lack of direct Russian disinformation efforts in the Nordic debates, and Fagersten said it was possible that future Russian interference would focus instead in one of the 30 Nato states that would have to ratify the treaty possibly over the next 12 months. He said it was also possible Russia, preoccupied by the Ukraine front, simply did not have the resources to respond to the unforeseen emergence of a new Nato flank. Asked what kind of disruption was possible, Wieslander said: 'The expectations are cyberattack, disinformation campaigns, electronic jamming, intrusions in our airspace, even something more official, that they have moved Iskander missiles into Kaliningrad [a Russian exclave sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland on the Baltic coast], but they have played with this card before. Their methods are designed to be ambiguous.'", "d3cec7d744da8c6bebd7d33d3284ce2e751ed53a8e7c266a1d6ff0fd": "We would like to hear from social media influencers about how they make their money.

The nearby tea shops do what they can to help, dishing out hot drinks to hundreds of people who have left fighting and drought in Ethiopia for sanctuary in Somaliland's border city. At night, families lie in rows on the pavements, huddled under blankets. In January, Anajow Abana travelled 300km from Tigray, in northern Ethiopia, to Somaliland. She and her three-year-old daughter are living on the city's streets, surviving on the charity of local people. 'We fled fighting and drought,' she says. 'The fighting was so bad and they killed my husband and two of my children. It took us 12 days to get here and was such a difficult time,' she says. Mimi Tadasse is also living on the streets of Borama. It took her 14 days to reach the city. 'We got here a week ago,' she says. 'It was a hard journey. We had to go through areas of fighting, and it was very dangerous.' Tadasse is from the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which has been engulfed in conflict during the war that began between forces loyal to the Tigrayan regional government and the Ethiopian armed forces in November 2020, and quickly spiralled to include a number of armed groups, regional militias and the Eritrean military. Mohamed Warsame (Baradho), the mayor of Borama, which is home to about 200,000 people, believes the number of refugees in the city is much higher than estimates. According to immigration officials, at least 10,000 people arrived in the first two months of 2022, he says, and many more will have crossed the porous border unofficially. Many refugees travel on to the capital Hargeisa and other areas, rather than staying in Borama. Some walk as far as Bosaso on the coast and try to get a boat across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen. From there, they walk to Saudi Arabia in the hope of finding employment as labourers or shepherds. People arriving from the Somali region of Ethiopia find it easier to assimilate and set up a shelter in the refugee camps, as they speak the language; it is much more challenging for those from Tigray, Amhara or Oromia. There are two refugee camps in Borama, where it is estimated more than 2,000 families reside. Some have been in the camps for more than 20 years, others just a few days. There is little infrastructure, but there is a school built by Unicef, and local and international NGOs have assisted with latrines and water points. The plight of the refugees in Borama is part of a growing crisis engulfing the Horn of Africa, where 16 million people in Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia are in dire need of food. Consecutive droughts have exacerbated the effects of war, leading to water scarcity, livestock deaths, soaring food prices and acute insecurity. A poor start to the 2022 rainy season coupled with the war in Ukraine could have catastrophic results, Save the Children warned in April. The mass movement of vulnerable people over insecure border areas threatens to further destabilise the region and harm communities, with many migrants facing the additional threat of unexploded ordnance (UXO) and landmines as they move through unfamiliar territories. The border with Ethiopia has been heavily fought over since the 60s, particularly during the 80s and 90s, meaning former battle sites are heavily contaminated with UXO. Dayis Amin and his wife, Suldan, are living in a refugee camp in Borama with their eight children having fled a disputed area close to Harar, Ethiopia. They say they were unable to grow any crops because of fighting and drought. Amin says: 'It is difficult here. Some days we eat nothing. 'We had a good life before. We had 20 cows and 30 sheep. Then there was trouble, and we couldn't get by. We couldn't farm because of the fighting, so when the drought came all the animals died. 'There were also explosions where we were, from the fighting. About six months ago, a group of children were playing with a metal item just 150 metres from our house. There was an explosion and five children died.' Omar Mohammed, Somalia country director for MAG, a humanitarian organisation that clears UXO and landmines, says: 'Moving across borders into Somaliland to seek humanitarian assistance or better conditions is the only way to cope for these people - while the UXOs and mines litter both sides of the border from previous wars. The UN estimates there were more than 317,000 newly displaced people within Somalia in January 2022 due to conflict and drought-related issues. 'We are doing our best to keep people safe by advising them of the risks of unexploded ordnance and landmines in the border areas, but they face multiple other risks because of the drought. Women and girls are having to walk longer distances to access water, for instance, exposing them to gender-based violence.' In the town of Baligubadle, approximately 170km south-east of Borama, refugees from Ethiopia arrive on a daily basis, along with displaced Somalis seeking water and food. 'People are dying,' says Abdi Karim Mohamed, director of families and livelihoods for the local government, 'We don't have enough water and we need help. Our reservoirs are dry. We bring water trucks all the way from Hargeisa, but that is very expensive and we can't manage to do that very often.' The Abdi Rahman family have just arrived in the town and are setting up makeshift shelters. 'We had to leave our home because the animals were dying because of the drought,' says the family matriarch, Koos. 'We had 200 goats before, but now we have only five. We have one cow - we lost four. The first animal died three months ago and then more died as they became weaker. We had lived there for generations but every year it became harder and harder to survive.' Rein Paulsen, director for emergencies and resilience at the UN Food and Agriculture Programme (FAO) says: 'We are most definitely now sitting on the brink of catastrophe, time is running out.' 'Harvests are ruined,' says Michael Dunford, regional director for the east Africa bureau of the UN World Food Programme (WFP). 'Livestock are dying, and hunger is growing.' Should the rains continue to fail, it will be the first time in more than 40 years that four dry seasons will have occurred consecutively. For people like Abana, and the millions of already vulnerable people in this part of the world, that is a terrifying prospect.

Nato allies expect Finland and Sweden to be granted membership quickly, five diplomats and officials told Reuters, paving the way for increased troop presence in the Nordic region during the one-year ratification period. In the lead-up to their Nato accession, British prime minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday promised to defend Sweden and Finland against potential Russian threats as he travelled to both countries to sign mutual security agreements. In the wider Nordic region, Norway, Denmark and the three Baltic states are already Nato members, and the addition of Finland and Sweden would probably anger Moscow, which says enlargement of the organisation is a direct threat to its own security. Russian president Vladimir Putin has cited the issue as a reason for his actions in Ukraine, which has also expressed a desire to eventually join the alliance. Moscow has also repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining the alliance, threatening 'serious military and political consequences'. Asked on Wednesday if Finland would provoke Russia by joining Nato, President Sauli Niinisto said Putin would be to blame. 'My response would be that you caused this. Look at the mirror,' Niinisto said. On Thursday European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen warned Russia was the 'most direct threat' to the international order because of its 'barbaric' war in Ukraine. Von der Leyen and European Council president Charles Michel are in Japan for talks that have touched on Russia's invasion of Ukraine but also growing concerns about China's role in Asia and beyond. Russia 'is today the most direct threat to the world order with the barbaric war against Ukraine, and its worrying pact with China,' she said after talks with Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida. On the frontlines, Ukraine on Wednesday said it had pushed back Russian forces in the east and shut gas flows on a route through Russian-held territory, raising the spectre of an energy crisis in Europe. Ukraine's armed forces' general staff said it had recaptured Pytomnyk, a village on the main highway north of the second-largest city of Kharkiv, about halfway to the Russian border. In another village near Kharkiv recaptured by Ukrainian forces in early April, resident Tatyana Pochivalova returned to find her home blasted to ruins. 'I have not expected anything like this, such aggression, such destruction,' a weeping Pochivalova said. 'I came and I kissed the ground, I simply kissed it. My home, there is nothing. Where am I to live, how am I to live?' The advance appears to be the fastest that Ukraine has mounted since it drove Russian troops away from the capital Kyiv and out of northern Ukraine at the beginning of April. If sustained, it could let Ukrainian forces threaten supply lines for Russia's main attack force, and put rear logistics targets in Russia itself within range of artillery. However, a senior US military official has warned that neither side can win in the present circumstances and that Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be settling into a gruelling and deadly stalemate in Ukraine's east. Despite an announcement from Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Ukrainian counter-offensives around the city of Kharkiv were pushing invading Russian forces back, Ukrainian successes appeared to be confined for now to the far north-eastern and south-western flanks of the 300-mile frontline. 'The Russians aren't winning, and the Ukrainians aren't winning, and we're at a bit of a stalemate here,' said Lt Gen Scott Berrier, director of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, who gave evidence on Tuesday alongside Avril Haines, the US national intelligence director, to the Senate armed forces committee. The assessment was delivered as the Russian military claimed its forces had advanced as far as the border between the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, potentially edging to securing control of the Donbas region despite losing ground around Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The developments came as Ukraine said it was shutting down Russian gas flows through territory held by Russian-backed separatists - the first time the conflict has directly disrupted shipments to Europe. For its part Moscow has imposed sanctions on the owner of the Polish part of the Yamal pipeline that carries Russian gas to Europe, as well as Gazprom's former German unit, whose subsidiaries service Europe's gas consumption. The implications for Europe, which buys more than a third of its gas from Russia, were not immediately clear. Berlin said it was looking into the announcement. An economy ministry spokesperson said the German government was 'taking the necessary precautions and preparing for various scenarios'. In southern Ukraine, where Russia has seized a swathe of territory, Kyiv has said Moscow plans to hold a fake referendum on independence or annexation to cement its occupation. Russian forces have also continued to bombard the Azovstal steelworks in the southern port of Mariupol, last bastion of Ukrainian defenders in a city 'If there is hell on earth, it is there,' wrote Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the Mariupol mayor, Vadym Boichenko, who has left the city. Ukraine says it is likely that tens of thousands of people have been killed in Mariupol. Ukrainian authorities say between 150,000 and 170,000 of the city's 400,000 residents are still living there amid the Russian-occupied ruins. With Reuters", "a631d7c85e9c3112f3037594803c3604e65374e2ae688e0cf562deef": "The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin's permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. If Russia attempts to annex the Kherson region it would make a peace agreement more unlikely, as Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that Russia's withdrawal to prewar positions was a precondition for any successful negotiation. It is not clear whether the Kremlin will go forward with an annexation or is using it as a threat to put pressure on Kyiv. The annexation call was made on Wednesday by Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the military administration Russia put in place to run Kherson in late April. Russia occupied Kherson in March and seized its city council building in late April. 'The city of Kherson is Russia; there will be no the KNR [Kherson People's Republic] on the territory of the Kherson region, there will be no referendums,' said Stremousov in a televised briefing. 'It will be a single decree based on the appeal of the leadership of the Kherson region to the president of the Russian Federation, and there will be a request to make [Kherson] into a full-fledged region of the Russian Federation.' Stremousov previously said that Kherson would begin using the rouble currency, a move seen as creeping integration into Russia. Russian officials who have visited Kherson have promised not to abandon the region. 'Russia is here to stay forever,' said Andrei Turchak, secretary general of Russia's ruling United Russia party, while visiting Kherson last week. 'There should be no doubt about it. There will be no return to the past.' But similar requests for annexation from territories such as the Russian-controlled Donetsk People's Republic have languished for years, as the Kremlin has dangled integration while seeking to put pressure on Kyiv. Putin began his new war in Ukraine by announcing the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, territories with local administrations also controlled by Russia. While there have been rumours they could hold new referendums to demand accession into Russia, that has not yet taken place. Local leaders say their model outcome is that of Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014 after a referendum under a puppet government. But few Russians have a similar attachment to the Kherson, Donetsk, or Luhansk regions, or want to see them as part of the Russian Federation. Turchak gave a careful answer when asked if Kherson would become part of Russia: 'Let's not get ahead of ourselves. In any case, the status will be determined by the residents,' he said. That view was echoed by the Kremlin on Wednesday, with its spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, saying any appeal should be 'decided by the residents of the Kherson region ... and residents of the Kherson region should also determine their fate'. He also said the decision would have to be vetted by lawyers and legal experts to be 'absolutely legitimate, as it was with Crimea'. Analysts have said that the call for annexation without a referendum indicated the weakness of the Russian position in those regions. Russia 'doesn't feel stable on occupied areas, they can't afford even fake referendum as in 2014. No local support at all,' wrote Maria Zolkina, a political analyst at Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based thinktank. Ukrainian officials, meanwhile, vowed that the Kherson region would be recaptured before any annexation could take place. 'The invaders may ask to join even Mars or Jupiter. The Ukrainian army will liberate Kherson, no matter what games with words they play,' said Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser.", "e7e2182c1d1dc0dd355661e6d39b2107aacc45b715121b21ee4216b2": "Three Russian prisoners of war accused of targeting or murdering civilians, and a soldier who allegedly killed a man before raping his wife, are set to be in the dock in the first war crimes trials of the Ukraine conflict, the Ukrainian prosecutor general has revealed. More than 10,700 crimes have been registered since the war began by the office of Ukraine's prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, and a handful of cases have now been filed or are ready to be submitted in what marks a watershed moment two months into the war. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya Tank Division, who is currently in Ukrainian custody, is expected to be the first to face trial over his alleged murder of a 68-year-old man. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of driving a stolen car with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters and then shooting dead the unarmed man on a bicycle as he was talking on his phone. He was ordered 'to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders', according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened close to the victim's house and was committed using an AK-74. The case has this week been filed at a criminal court. 'He is here [in Ukraine], we have him,' said Venediktova, speaking from her heavily fortified headquarters in Kyiv. A spokesperson added: 'Prosecutors and investigators of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services] have collected enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder. For these actions, he faces 10 to 15 years in prison or life in prison.' Separately, on 24 February, the day Vladimir Putin's 'special military operation'was launched, it is alleged two Russian soldiers using a Soviet truck-mounted 122mm multiple rocket launcher carried out artillery shelling of homes and civilian buildings in the village of Kozacha Lopan in Kharkiv district. They also allegedly hit an 'educational institution' in the city of Dergachiv, from Belgorod in Russia. The soldiers later crossed over the border of Ukraine and continued shelling targets in the Kharkiv region, it is claimed, but they were taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces and now await trial. Their case file, laying out charges of breaking the laws and customs of war, has also been filed at a criminal procedural court in Ukraine, but names and photographs are yet to be issued. In a final case that is probably heading to a trial in absentia, a soldier named as Mikhail Romanov, who has a large tattoo of a bear on his chest, is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while 'threatening her and her underage child with violence and weapons'. A second soldier also raped the 33-year-old woman, who has a four-year-old son. The case is yet to be filed at court but the prosecutor's office was able to provide a photograph from social media that has been used by the victim to identify the man who allegedly attacked her. Romanov's apparent partner was contacted for comment by this newspaper but she did not respond to questions. Of Romanov, Venediktova said: 'Now we don't know where he is - maybe he is fighting still, maybe he is on rotation in the Russian federation, maybe he is dead. We don't know but we want to prosecute him in absentia.' She added: 'We want to demonstrate to these criminals that we will find them. And we will prevent the deaths of other people in other territories.' Venediktova, who on Monday travelled to the border with Poland to meet the UK attorney general, Suella Braverman, who has provided her with a former international criminal court judge as an adviser, said 36 identified war crimes suspects were currently being prosecuted, with various levels of progress. Venediktova, whose office desk has a dozen hotlines, including one to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said she feared many more crimes would emerge from the territories in the east and south of Ukraine currently occupied by Russia, including the devastated port city of Mariupol. Venediktova, who keeps a Russian cluster bomb casing that was found in Kherson, a city in south Ukraine, on her desk, said countless atrocities were being committed. She said: 'I have a theory that the Russian federation decided that when they come to Ukraine everyone will be happy to see them but when they understood that the whole population was fighting against them, against a common enemy, they decided to do everything to scare the population.' At the end of March videos emerged of alleged war crimes committed by Ukrainian soldiers against Russian prisoners of war, including a film that appeared to show three soldiers being shot in the legs. Venediktova said her office was continuing to investigate those claims and others. She said: 'We shall not act as barbarians but as people who understand the rule of law. We are still investigating but as I understand some of the facts could be fake. [But] there is not only one case where we started investigations, we have several.'", "78f6b7896467ea006bb1358c1a16b1e4f47a575a8f5232295223c88f": "There's an acrid smell in the air and an unsettling crunch underfoot as we step over the metallic black and gold detritus of war. Ahead of us, framed by tree branches amputated by tank shells and mortar fire, the sky is reflecting brilliantly on the shimmering flood waters. After negotiating more than a dozen army checkpoints within the thick forests of Kyiv's outer boundary, we have reached the flooded village of Demydiv on the Irpin River and the long-lost wetland basin, which has returned after the dam was opened by Ukrainian troops defending the capital from Russian army units, and was later struck by a missile. The breaching of the Irpin dam at the end of February held back the Russian soldiers and tanks, and reflooded 13,000 hectares (32,000 acres) of wetlands that were drained by the Soviets in the 1960s. Until the outbreak of war, the floodplain was due to be become the foundations of a massive new housing development. But with the waters possibly back for good, the future of the fragile ecology - and that of local communities - is uncertain. Local ecologist Volodymyr Boreyko is calling for the Irpin River to be given the title of 'Hero River', and for Ukraine to follow the precedent set by Ecuador in 2008, when it became the first country in the world to recognise the rights of nature in its constitution. 'I think the Irpin River should be awarded the title of 'Hero River' and be given strong environmental protections, because this year the Irpin, in tandem with the UAF [Ukrainian armed forces] and territorial defence forces, played one of the most important roles in the defence of our capital for the last 1,000 years,' says Boreyko. The large construction projects previously approved for the Irpin floodplain should be cancelled, he adds. The battle for Kyiv wasn't the only time the Irpin has saved the city and, without it, he says, Kyiv would be left vulnerable to attack in the future. 'A thousand years ago, in the days of Kyivan Rus, the Irpin River repeatedly protected Kyiv from the north and north-west from the attacks of the Polovtsians and Pechenegs. It is 162km (101 miles) long, and its floodplain is so wide and swampy, enemy cavalry could not pass. 'If Putin had attacked in a year or two from now, the river Irpin would not have been able to defend the capital because its entire floodplain would have been cemented over and the river itself would be hidden in a collector and be no obstacle whatsoever to enemy tanks.' Before Soviet occupation, says Bohdan Prots, head of plant ecology at the National Museum of Natural History and director of the Centre for Environmental Studies and Nature Conservation, the Irpin floodplain was a biodiversity hotspot, a kind of Ukrainian Amazon, with vast wetlands composed of bogs, swamps and marshes that thrived along riverbanks of thick reed beds and dunes of golden sand. 'It was 5 metres deep in places, and full of giant catfish and sturgeon, as well as now-missing wetland bird species and birds of prey, like the white-tailed eagle.' According to Prots, Soviet dams on the Irpin and Dnipro had a catastrophic impact on the ecosystems of the Irpin and its many tributaries that once thrived here. Many housing developments were built on the old floodplain, putting further pressure on the dying river ecosystem. 'Wetlands can't be restored just like that,' says Prots. 'They [the Soviets] created huge environmental problems by damming and adding locks to the Irpin, which over the years steadily reduced the volume and flow velocity of water, which encouraged excessive algae that in turn reduced water oxygenation to the point where big fish could no longer breathe. 'Just because the water has returned it doesn't mean we are looking at a new wetland rich in biodiversity. The ecology has been very badly degraded over many, many years. It would need many years for ecological improvements to be observed,' he adds. The sudden re-flooding of the old Kyiv-Irpin wetlands, which was also used as a first defence by Ukrainians defending Kyiv against the Germans in 1941, is very unlikely to have the kind of ecological benefits a carefully managed rewilding project would produce, he says. 'War doesn't do rewilding - there was no research, there was no planning or mitigation. It might have helped us defend our capital, but before long there will be pressure to redrain this area. Can you imagine how many trillions of mosquitoes will be here this summer?' Prots says he thinks the local government will come under pressure to rebuild the Irpin dam. But while the war is still raging and the Kyiv region still littered with mines, it could be some time before any attempt could begin. 'I think there's a good chance it [the dam] will be rebuilt eventually, but right now all our energies and thoughts are on defeating the invaders, because this is an existential issue for us. Until it is resolved and the Russians are kicked out of our lands, we can't properly address this issue.' Alexey Vasilyuk, biologist and founder and chairman of the Ukrainian Nature Conservation Group (UNCG), says he is hopeful the reflooded Irpin wetlands will remain. 'First of all, these waters are now serving in the defence of Kyiv, so until we are sure Russia won't try to seize Kyiv again, I don't see how we can justify completely draining this area again. Secondly, I think it will be extremely difficult or maybe impossible to reverse what has happened. 'Hypothetically speaking, it might become a very good spawning ground for fish that have dramatically declined here over the last decades, and also become an important breeding ground for many species of rare wetland birds,' he says. But, says Vasilyuk, the return of the water could pose as many problems as opportunities. 'The local ecosystem of the Irpin River basin was in a bad way before the dam burst,' he says. 'And now, a lot of Russian tanks and military equipment are underwater here. The mixing of chemicals and oils from fuel tanks with pollution from inundated landfills is a big threat,' he says. 'Right before the war, many parts of the land were sprayed with pesticides and fertilisers, so there are many threats for humans and wildlife that should be resolved.' Despite the hazards and dangers, Vasilyuk remains optimistic that solutions can be found, and that Kyiv's ancient wetlands may be back for good. 'While the soldiers of the Ukrainian armed forces are fighting to stop the genocide of the Ukrainian people, we think that the environmental front should take care to prevent ecocide,' says Vasilyuk. 'This is possibly the most precious and important wetland in Ukraine, not because of its fragile or unique biodiversity, but because without this swampy barrier, the battle for Kyiv might have had a very different outcome.'

They became war correspondents overnight. Ukrainian journalists were spotlighted this week when the Pulitzer prize board awarded them with a special citation, hailing the country's reporters for the 'courage, endurance and commitment to truthful reporting' they have shown since the Russian invasion. But initially, writing stories and making television reports was secondary for the reporters, editors, and producers who heard explosions around them and scrambled for safety. For more than a month many Ukrainian journalists focused on survival. Some have since returned to work, but often they lack protective equipment and hostile environment training. 'Lots of journalists left Kyiv,' said Kristina Berdynskykh, a journalist at one of Ukraine's major independent publications, Novoye Vremya. 'They weren't thinking about whether they'd be fired, they were just thinking that they had to get their families out.' After the first few days almost all of the staff of Ukraine's prominent newsrooms fled westwards to Lviv where many remain. Lviv quickly became the new temporary capital when Russian forces surrounded Kyiv. 'From the print journalists I know, there was maybe a handful left in Kyiv,' said Berdynskykh. 'It is mostly the TV stations who had small teams of war correspondents who had experience in the Donbas. For everyone else, the situation was an absolute shock.' Those who stayed in Ukraine's hotspots embarked on new careers. Berdynskykh spent 18 nights sleeping on the floor in Kyiv's metro to avoid the shelling and conducted phone interviews. Without a car or taxis, and with shells flying into the city, in-person interviews were near to impossible for the first month she said. 'At first it was practically just western journalists - war correspondents - doing on-the-ground reporting,' said Berdynskykh, who was a leading political reporter but is now focusing on the experiences of ordinary Ukrainians around the country. 'But I'm grateful to them because we were still adapting.' Original reporting has since returned to Ukraine's news sites but most newsrooms cannot afford to simultaneously provide their staff with protective equipment and pay salaries, said Katerina Sergatskova, who founded 24.02 Fund, whose aim is to raise money to help equip reporters and newsrooms with the necessary equipment. The income from online advertising which many Ukrainian news sites relied on dried up when the economy shut down. The demand for protective equipment from Ukrainian journalists has increased as journalists return to work, said Sergatskova. After a month of searching for suppliers, amid a worldwide shortage of bulletproof vests, the 24.02 Fund has now sourced 150 vests and helmets as well as first aid kits and it is working with other organisations to provide first aid training to journalists. Sergatskova, who is a managing editor of Zaborona, another independent Ukrainian publication, fled Kyiv on the seventh day of the war to evacuate her two small children. 'When we saw a Russian plane being shot down from our [apartment's] window, we decided we had to get out,' said Sergatskova. 'At first, we took the children to Lviv and then rockets started to hit there, so we took them to live with friends in Europe. Now we can work knowing that they're safe.' Others, such as Kirill Gonchar in Ukraine's eastern city of Kharkiv, found themselves even more in the deep end. Gonchar was a creative director of a production company, who shot commercials and promotional videos for newsrooms and businesses before the war. Russian bombs devastated Kharkiv in the first few weeks of the war and the city is still shelled several times a day. When Gonchar realised that Kharkiv's journalists had either left or could not leave their basements, he ventured out into the city's streets under shelling to start filming. He said he was almost the only person working on the ground and was soon sending his footage to the BBC, the Associated Press, CNN and others. 'I just felt I had to act and this was something I could do,' said Gonchar. 'At first I thought I'd make a documentary but then I realised that I just needed to just do news so I could share what was happening.' Gonchar said he started looking for a vest and helmet and writing to people after the first week. But it was only after five weeks of working on the ground that some of his former employers managed to source a vest and helmet for him. Asked how he felt about working without equipment, he said that in some ways he did not know any different. When international journalists started arriving in Kharkiv in late March with full kit, it started to figure more heavily on his mind. 'There were several times when I was almost hit,' he said. 'One of the houses that my friends and I moved into because it had a basement was completely destroyed by a rocket a week after I moved out. 'Those who were in the basement survived,' said Gonchar, whose friends were seriously injured in the attack. 'But I can't say I was scared [to work] because I knew other people had it worse than me.' Since 24 February, at least seven journalists have been killed while working in the field and dozens have been injured, according to Ukraine's Institute of Mass Information, a media development organisation.", "9c922eb59d986e26ea624fddcc3f18de4207e5eef7a7e8cc37867f57": "North Korea has declared a 'severe national emergency' after confirming its first outbreak of Covid-19, prompting its leader, Kim Jong-un, to vow to quickly eliminate the virus. State media reported on Thursday that a sub-variant of the highly transmissible Omicron virus, known as BA.2, had been detected in the capital, Pyongyang. 'There has been the biggest emergency incident in the country, with a hole in our emergency quarantine front, that has been kept safely over the past two years and three months since February 2020,' the official KCNA news agency said. The report said people in Pyongyang had contracted the Omicron variant, without providing details on case numbers or possible sources of infection. North Korea had claimed it had not recorded a single case of Covid-19 since it closed its borders at the start of the pandemic more than two years ago. The discovery of the Omicron variant presents a potentially serious risk to North Korea, which has not vaccinated any of its 25 million people, according to experts, and its poorly resourced healthcare system would also struggle to cope with a major outbreak. The country so far has shunned vaccines offered by the UN-backed Covax distribution programme, possibly because administering the jabs would require international monitoring. The Seoul-based NK News reported that areas of Pyongyang had been in lockdown for two days. 'Multiple sources have also heard reports of panic buying due to uncertainty of when the lockdown might end,' it said, citing sources in the city. The KCNA report said samples taken from patients in Pyongyang who had developed fevers were 'consistent with' the Omicron variant. The discovery prompted Kim to call a crisis meeting of the Workers' party politburo, where officials said they would implement 'maximum' emergency measures. They reportedly include tighter border controls and lockdown measures, with Kim telling citizens 'to completely block the spread of the malicious virus by thoroughly blocking their areas in all cities and counties across the country'. All business and production activities will be organised so each work unit is 'isolated' to prevent the spread of disease, KCNA said. Kim told the meeting that 'the goal was to eliminate the root within the shortest period of time', it added. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the regime's public acknowledgment of coronavirus cases meant 'the public health situation must be serious'. 'This does not mean North Korea is suddenly going to be open to humanitarian assistance and take a more conciliatory line toward Washington and Seoul,' he said. Easley said the presence of the virus could affect any plans the leadership has for missile or nuclear tests. 'The Kim regime's domestic audience may be less interested in nuclear or missile tests when the urgent threat involves coronavirus rather than a foreign military,' he said. 'The Kim regime would be well advised to swallow its pride and quickly seek donations of vaccines and therapeutics.' North Korea closed its borders to nearly all trade and visitors at the start of the pandemic, inflicting more pain on an economy already damaged by decades of mismanagement and international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes. It tentatively reopened railroad freight traffic with China in January, but Chinese authorities halted trade last month after a Covid-19 outbreak in Dandong, a city close to the border with North Korea.", "ecbd3094d9f65c2b6a1b9a85ecd3d12ad0334e7fbfb75503d738f1f7": "The US Senate on Wednesday failed to advance legislation that would codify the right to an abortion into federal law, after it was blocked by Republicans. It was a largely symbolic vote by Democrats to mobilize Americans around the issue ahead of a likely supreme court decision striking down the protections enshrined by Roe v Wade. The Senate roll call was a stark reflection of the partisan divide over abortion rights, with all Republicans and one conservative Democrat, Joe Manchin of Virginia, voting against the measure. The final tally was 49-51, well short of the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster in the Senate. 'Sadly the Senate failed to stand in defense of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body,' Kamala Harris, the first woman and woman of color to serve as vice-president, told reporters outside of the Senate chamber, where she presided over the doomed vote. Pointing to the onslaught of laws restricting abortion access in Republican-led states, Harris said that 'the priority should be to elect pro-choice leaders at the local, the state and the federal level'. Joe Biden, who has called on the Democratic-controlled Congress to protect abortion rights, blamed Republicans, saying they 'have chosen to stand in the way of Americans' rights to make the most personal decisions about their own bodies, families and lives'. The president vowed to sign any bill that would secure reproductive rights and pledged to explore ways his administration could act in lieu of Congress. Democrats moved quickly to stage the vote after a leak last week of a draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito in February and confirmed as authentic, indicated that the court's conservative majority had privately voted to strike down Roe and subsequent rulings. The extraordinary disclosure ignited protests around the country, pushing reproductive rights to the center of the political debate six months before the congressional midterms. A final ruling from the court is expected this summer. Ahead of the vote, a group of House Democratic women marched across the Capitol to protest against the end of Roe, chanting: 'My body, my decision.' Democrats, under intensifying pressure to act, saw a political opportunity in forcing Republicans to vote against a bill protecting abortion at a moment when the threat to access is urgent and polls show a majority of Americans want the procedure to remain legal in all or some cases. They hope to use the Republican blockade as a data point in their midterm message to voters: that the GOP has become a party of 'ultra-Maga' extremists, on the cusp of fulfilling a decades-long goal to strip women of their reproductive rights. It is an issue Democrats hope will energize young voters disenchanted by the Biden administration and persuade Republican-leaning suburban women to back them again this cycle. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, urging support for the measure, warned that a failure to protect abortion access would put at risk other individual rights like contraception and same-sex marriage. 'If we do not take a stand now to protect a woman's right to choose, then mark my words, it will be open season, open season on our God-given freedoms,' Schumer said in a floor speech ahead of a vote that he called 'one of the most consequential we will take in decades'. If passed, the bill would have codified Roe v Wade into federal law, ensuring the right of healthcare providers to perform abortions and the right of patients to receive them. But it would also go further, in some cases invalidating state-level restrictions on abortion access enacted after the Roe decision in 1973. As such, Republicans cast the bill as a 'radical' attempt to expand reproductive rights that goes far beyond Roe and would legalize 'abortion on demand'. 'We will stand with the American people, stand with innocent life, and block the Democrats' extreme bill,' the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Wednesday. Republicans are betting the economy will take precedence over abortion this November. Polling shows Republicans are well positioned to make significant gains in the midterm elections, buoyed by historical headwinds, discontent with the party in power and widespread concern over the rising cost of gas, food and rent. But there are signs that Republicans do worry about a potential political backlash if Roe is overturned and states move swiftly to outlaw abortion, as many are preparing to do. A day ahead of the vote, McConnell, who effectively secured a conservative super-majority on the supreme court, sought to downplay calls for a nationwide ban on abortion if they take control of the chamber in November, telling reporters: 'Historically, there have been abortion votes on the floor of the Senate. None of them have achieved 60 votes.' The two Senate Republicans who support abortion rights, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, opposed the bill, instead urging support for an alternative measure that they say is tailored to reflect the landscape of abortion rights. But many Democrats see their proposal, which is not expected to receive a vote, as too weak. 'Unlike some far-left activists, Senator Murkowski and I want the law today to be the law tomorrow,' Collins said on Wednesday, objecting to the lack of protections for religious exemptions in the Democrats' bill. In a dramatic shift, one of the only other Democrats in Congress with conservative views on abortion rights, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, said he would support the measure and voted in favor of advancing it. In a statement citing the leaked supreme court ruling, Casey said the 'circumstances around the entire debate on abortion' had changed since the last time the Senate voted on the measure. Abortion is also likely to be a major issue in races for governor and state offices, as the battle lines shift to the states, where Democrats are racing to secure and expand abortion access and Republicans are working to limit, or in some cases, outlaw it. The show vote on Wednesday only intensified calls from progressives for Democrats to eliminate the filibuster or carve out an exception for abortion rights. But at this point, there are not 60 votes to codify Roe, and there is not enough Democratic support to eliminate or amend the Senate filibuster. Without a clear legislative path forward, Democrats are turning to the fall elections, urging Americans to elect them as the 'last lines of defense' against the end of Roe. 'I am angry and I'm disappointed,' Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington and a long-time advocate of reproductive rights, said after Wednesday's vote. She urged Americans concerned over the threat to abortion to not lose hope. 'Now is not the time to back down or sit down,' she said. 'Now is the time to lift up our voices and fight back. And that's exactly what we're going to do.'", "7bc3dc8f9e86acf97bc44f6f53985d7253d3991d8af507aaef73bd2f": "Trevor Foster, 26, loved the Cowboys, the Yankees, fishing, animals and above all his daughter.

All were among US overdose deaths in 2021, a record year for such fatalities with an estimated 107,622, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Wednesday. It was an increase of 15% from the previous year, which was also a record. The US has now passed 1m overdose deaths since the CDC began collecting data about two decades ago. The surge in deaths in 2021 was fueled primarily by fentanyl, a highly dangerous synthetic opioid that accounted for about 70% of fatalities. Black American men and boys have the highest fatality rates from drug overdoses, followed closely by American Indian and Alaska Native men and boys - a significant increase among these demographics in recent years. Overdose deaths among teens have doubled in the past three years, even though drug use is decreasing overall among teens. Teens are more likely to buy pills they think are Adderall, Xanax or Percocet, seeking help in studying for exams, calming anxiety, helping sleep, or treating pain, said Dr Nora D Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (Nida) at the National Institutes of Health. 'They've been doing this for decades. What is now different is these prescription drugs that are illicitly manufactured containing fentanyl have increased fiftyfold,' Volkow said. The almost fiftyfold increase in illicit pills containing fentanyl happened between 2018 and 2021, she said - a 'huge proliferation'. One-time and casual users, including children, are dying. 'They were poisoned by taking a pill that contains something that they did not know was there,' Volkow said. Cameron March, 23, was a Sacramento Kings basketball fan, one of 10 children in a bustling blended family. From a friend, he bought two pills he thought were Percocet. He had struggled with anxiety and depression since middle school and he had bought pills before.

Volkow said: 'We as a nation have to say, 'What is it that we can do to avoid that [increase in deaths] happening again?' What is it that we're doing wrong?' Drug overdoses are particularly tragic because they are entirely preventable, Volkow said. Opioid overdoses can be reversed with naloxone. Schools and parents, Volkow said, need to reach out to kids to educate them on the dangers of fentanyl, and medical providers can screen for drug use in teenagers or the presence of an underlying mental disorder, like anxiety or depression. Offering social support can also make a huge difference. 'Isolation, feeling that actually nobody cares for you, is one of the factors that increases risk - that you don't have alternatives in your life, that you're not doing well at school, that you feel very, very depressed and nobody seems to care,' Volkow said. 'This is a disease of distress. So what are the support systems that we need to provide to people to contain this very dangerous use of drugs?' Harm reduction is also an important part of stemming the tide of deaths, Volkow said. That includes the widespread distribution of naloxone, which is extremely easy to use in the inhalable form known as Narcan. 'It's a no-brainer,' Volkow said. Offering substance use treatment options, distributing test strips to detect the presence of fentanyl, offering needle exchanges and safe injection sites, and ensuring a safe, uncontaminated supply of substances for those who continue using are also important steps for addressing the epidemic of overdose deaths. Many of those who die from overdoses are young, Volkow said. 'They are in the most productive years of their life. Many of them have families and children, and all of them are left behind.' Overdose can strike anyone, even the first time they take a contaminated pill. 'It's not a drug addict problem,' Lisa Ezell said. 'It could be a one-time thing at a party, or your kid has a toothache or a back problem and they get a pill from a friend.' She wants officials to hold people accountable, and to do everything they can to spread the word about the epidemic sweeping the US.

Basil died in hospital while awaiting airlift to Port Moresby late on Wednesday after the crash, which took place in the Wau-Bulolo region, Morobe province. 'Local police attended to the accident site and immediately retrieved the deputy prime minister and three other injured persons and transported them to Bulolo to seek medical attention at the Bulolo Health facility,' said David Manning, the police commissioner, in a statement. 'After hours of attempting to revive him Mr Basil succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced clinically dead at 11:30 pm last night.' Police later confirmed that a close protection officer travelling with Basil had also died. Police launched an investigation into the accident and the second vehicle involved. The driver of that vehicle 'was known', Manning said, adding: 'I appeal to any eyewitnesses to the incident to come forward to assist investigators in their investigations.' Basil, the leader of the United Labour party, is the eighth MP to have died in this parliamentary term.

The case sparked nationwide outrage in the EU country where Catholic church-backed conservative groups aspire to curb the right to abortion, which is legal until the 10th week of pregnancy. After that period, it can be performed if the health of the mother or foetus is seriously jeopardised, as well as in cases of rape or incest. But abortion is becoming more restricted as rising religious pressure sways doctors to refuse it on moral grounds. Mirela Cavajda's foetus was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in late April, in the sixth month of pregnancy. Doctors told the 39-year-old, who already has one child, that the foetus would - if born - either die or have serious defects, she told local media. They advised Cavajda to seek help in neighbouring Slovenia. Meanwhile, four public hospitals in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, refused to carry out the abortion without explanation or after saying they could not confirm the diagnosis or lacked the necessary conditions. But Croatian health minister Vili Beros said on Wednesday that a medical 'commission allowed the termination of [Cavajda's] pregnancy'. 'The situation is extremely difficult,' as the MRI scan of her foetus's brain showed, he told reporters. That is why the commission estimated that 'both medical and legal preconditions for the approval of abortion have been met', he said. The case angered members of rights groups and many other people in the Balkan country. On Thursday, rallies in support of Cavajda are due to be held in Zagreb and several other cities. Nearly 90% of Croatia's population of 3.9 million are Roman Catholic and the church remains immensely influential. In 2017, the country's top court rejected calls from church-backed conservatives for a ban on abortion. It also ordered the parliament to adopt a new law on abortion regulations and ruled that the current one, dating back to the 1970s, was outdated.", "d08ac02307f9d7a389b7bbb1c23e0c75df4bc64f119e368e5f3a608a": "A police crackdown in Vanuatu that has seen people arrested for allegedly posting comments on social media speculating politicians were responsible for the country's current Covid outbreak has raised serious concerns about freedom of speech in the Pacific country. At least four people on two separate islands have been arrested as part of a major investigation by Vanuatu's Serious Crime Unit in the last few weeks, including a factory worker, a printer, a business owner, and a Facebook page moderator. They face charges of cyber stalking, cyber slander, and cyber libel and face up to three years in prison and fines of up to three million Vatu (US$25,838). The charges relate to alleged comments on Facebook claiming that two politicians in the country had breached Covid quarantine protocols, one of which had played a role in the community transmission of the virus. These are the first arrests under Vanuatu's new cybercrime legislation passed into law last year. Australia has been working with Vanuatu to bolster its cybersecurity capability as part of its overall diplomatic efforts to combat China's rising influence in the region. According to the explanatory note introducing the legislation , the government said the act was to combat cybercrime, which it called 'a global phenomenon that poses threats to Vanuatu's national infrastructure, public service delivery, commercial and financial security.' Vanuatu's Opposition leader Ralph Regenvanu has accused the government of using the laws for political ends. 'What is happening now is that the government and the police are using the excuse of the lockdown restrictions being lifted to basically just try and clamp down on dissent, on anyone having any different views.' Andrea Woi, 38, a single mother and factory processor, is one of those charged with criminal slander and cyber stalking. Investigators flew from the capital of Port Vila to the northern island of Santo, where she lives, and came to her workplace on 26 April to arrest her. She was taken from to the police station in Luganville and told she was facing serious charges which could result in three years' imprisonment, and a fine of up to three million Vatu. 'Three police officers came to my workplace and asked for me. I heard one police officer say to the other that I was a suspect. They told me my case was very serious and that I could go to jail for three years. I was very scared,' said Woi. She is accused of making a comment on a Facebook post insinuating an MP - Anthony Iauko - had breached quarantine, something he denies. Woi has since been told she must fly to Port Vila to answer the charges this month. Her family has had to talk her out of resigning her job in shame. Witnol Benkor Tor, a Facebook moderator of a news site known as Vanuatu Politics and News, was one of the first to be charged under the police crackdown. He has been charged with cyber libel, cyber slander and cyber stalking and also faces up to three years' imprisonment and a fine of up to three million Vatu. He was charged after someone posted on his Facebook page under a pseudonym, making allegations that Iauko breached Covid rules to visit someone in quarantine. Tor says he does not know who wrote the post. 'I am worried about what this means for freedom of speech,' said Tor. 'I posted nothing wrong myself. I am simply one of the moderators of a page. When I set up the Vanuatu News and Politics page, I invited people from both sides of politics to help moderate it in the interests of balance.' The Facebook page has since been taken down, though not by Tor. The Guardian has confirmed four people have been charged in the crackdown, but Tor believes there are many others too. He said when he was taken to the police station there was a long list of names on the wall of people the Serious Crimes Unit was investigating. Prior to the arrests, the government used a regular Covid briefing which was broadcast live on Facebook to outline charges of cyber libel, cyber slander and cyberstalking that now exist under the new legislation. Vanuatu police were contacted for comment. The crackdown was initiated following the discovery of the first case of the virus in the community earlier this year, signalling that Vanuatu's days as a Covid-free nation were over. Vanuatu was one of the last countries in the world to experience the impact of community transmission from the coronavirus pandemic, only recording cases among returning citizens or visa holders, who were isolated and successfully treated in quarantine before being allowed to return home. However, in March, the virus spread to the community and health authorities issued a statement saying the transmission must have resulted from a breach of quarantine.  On 5 March, Anthony Iauko, a government MP, presented at the country's main hospital feeling unwell and tested positive for the virus. The opposition leader Ralph Regenvanu issued a statement on 8 March alleging that Iauko unlawfully entered quarantine several times and also that he took people out of quarantine to socialise with him. Iauko has denied these claims and says he contracted Covid when he visited the hospital. There was widespread speculation in media and on social media in Vanuatu that Iauko was 'Case Zero' - the case that started community transmission. Health officials have confirmed to the Guardian that Iauko was the first reported locally acquired Covid case in the country. When contacted by the Guardian, Iauko declined to comment and said to 'contact my lawyer', but did not provide the lawyer's name or phone number. Regenvanu lodged a complaint with police against Iauko in March for allegedly breaching the Public Health Act. Vanuatu's police chief has confirmed the investigation into Iauko has been dropped. Regenvanu also made allegations against the country's deputy prime minister Ishmael Alatoi Kalsakau, accusing him of leaving quarantine before the end of a seven day quarantine extension without gaining official clearance. Kalsakau did complete the initial 14 days in quarantine. He is not accused of spreading the virus as a result of the alleged breach. 'The DPM (deputy prime minister) came on a New Zealand flight on 20 February with 19 passengers who were later tested positive. The protocol is to extend the quarantine of all passengers on the same flight for a further seven days,' Regenvanu said in his statement. 'He was home by last Sunday afternoon while his fellow passengers remain in [extended] quarantine in accordance with the law.' Kalsakau told local media he received authorisation to leave after 14 days and tested negative three times before leaving quarantine. He also said that he asked the Ministry of Health if there was anything preventing him from leaving quarantine after 14 days and did not receive a response. Regenvanu has submitted a request under freedom of information laws to receive a copy of the recommendation from a medical officer that Kalsakau could be discharged from a quarantine facility. Kalsakau was contacted for comment. Thirteen people have died since the Omicron strain was detected in Vanuatu in March. The virus has now spread to five of the country's six provinces. There have been almost 7,000 confirmed cases in Vanuatu since the beginning of the year.", "4382a964327d7803e765cfd6218f23ee71f9ecce25b8e83c94b6e7eb": "Lufthansa has apologised for refusing to let any members of a large group of Orthodox Jewish passengers on to a flight after some of them had refused to wear masks. The German airline said in a statement that it 'regrets the circumstances surrounding the decision to exclude the affected passengers from the flight, for which Lufthansa sincerely apologises'. The airline said it was reviewing what had happened during the incident on 4 May, involving passengers from New York transiting in Frankfurt for a flight to Budapest. Some of the passengers had allegedly refused to comply with rules requiring them to wear face masks, whereupon Lufthansa staff allegedly blocked all passengers who were visibly identifiable as Jewish from boarding their connecting flight, German daily Frankfurter Allgemeiner Zeitung reported. Local German media reported that the staff excluded those passengers who were recognisable as being Jewish because they were wearing skull caps or had sidelocks. 'We regret that the large group was denied boarding rather than limiting it to the non-compliant guests,' the airline said. 'We have zero tolerance for racism, antisemitism and discrimination of any type,' it added. Uwe Becker, the antisemitism commissioner of the state of Hesse, where Frankfurt is located, sharply condemned the incident. Becker said that apparently an entire group of people - solely because of their recognisable faith - had been held responsible for something that obviously only affected individual travellers. 'This is discriminatory and not a trivial matter, and all the more reason why the company's top management should also feel personally responsible for apologising for this incident and taking a clear and unequivocal stand,' Becker told the German news agency dpa. Becker said he would be happy to have a conversation with Lufthansa on the matter.

The findings from the small study indicate that it could be time to reconsider how pain is treated. Normal recovery from a painful injury involves inflammation - the body's natural reaction to injury and infection - and new research suggests blocking inflammation with drugs could lead to harder-to-treat issues. It may be that inflammation has a protective effect, such as preventing acute pain from becoming chronic, and that overly reducing it may be harmful. Jeffrey Mogil, a professor of pain studies at McGill University in Canada, said: 'While ibuprofen was not studied explicitly in either the human or the mouse data (in the mouse we used diclofenac), as ibuprofen is so common in the UK, it is highly likely that a large percentage of those in the UK Biobank who reported taking 'NSAIDs' (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) were in fact taking ibuprofen.' Researchers said lower-back pain was the most commonly reported form of chronic pain - pain that persists for longer than would be expected after the injury - and resulted in massive economic and medical costs each year. Most patients receive standard treatments such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen and corticosteroids. But these drugs are only somewhat effective, and little is known about why acute pain, which begins suddenly in response to something specific, is resolved in some patients but persists as chronic pain in others. To understand the transition from acute to chronic lower-back pain, researchers followed 98 patients with acute lower-back pain for three months. They also examined the mechanisms of pain in both humans and mice, and found that neutrophils - a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infection - play a key role in resolving pain. Blocking these cells in mice prolonged the pain for up to 10 times the normal duration. Treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids such as dexamethasone and diclofenac also produced the same result, although they were effective against pain early on. Researchers said the findings were supported by a separate analysis of 500,000 people in the UK Biobank study, which showed that those taking anti-inflammatory drugs were more likely to have pain two to 10 years later. This effect was not seen in people taking paracetamol or antidepressants. Dr Franziska Denk, senior lecturer at King's College London, said: 'It would most definitely be premature to make any recommendations regarding people's medication until we have results of a prospectively designed clinical trial.' Prof Blair Smith, from the University of Dundee, said: 'The theory is that inflammation may have a protective effect in the long-term, and that overly reducing inflammation may be harmful. 'However, it is important to note that this is just one study, and more research is needed to confirm and investigate this further.' The findings are published in Science Translational Medicine.", "e8511e278cd776c3e3b912c6b0cbbc8fc81ab1a93f52ef511d78e347": "Rebekah Vardy has denied being willing to lie under oath in the 'Wagatha Christie' libel trial, as she admitted allowing her agent to access Coleen Rooney's private Instagram posts. Giving evidence on Wednesday, the second day of the trial, Vardy also accepted she had attempted to leak a story about the arrest of Premier League footballer Danny Drinkwater to the Sun - accompanied by the note: 'I want paying for this x.' Vardy told the high court this leak was a one-off incident motivated by the desire to expose a drink-driver. She also insisted that multiple other WhatsApp conversations with her agent, Caroline Watt, concerning leaking stories to the Sun about other celebrities - including Rooney, model Danielle Lloyd and unnamed footballers - were jokes that should not be taken seriously. In response, Rooney's barrister, David Sherborne, said this was 'completely untrue', and it was impossible to believe Vardy and Watt were just joking about selling stories to the Sun. He also claimed there were discrepancies between Vardy's written witness statement and her spoken evidence in court. 'What this shows, Mrs Vardy, is that you are prepared to lie under oath,' he said. Vardy replied: 'No.' Sherborne alleged there was an established pattern of behaviour, where Vardy passed story tips to Watt, who then gave them to journalists at the Sun. He told Vardy: 'It's not that you didn't want to do the dirty, it's that you didn't want to be seen to be doing the dirty.' The court also heard how Vardy - the wife of Leicester City footballer Jamie Vardy - shared her Instagram account with Watt. This enabled her agent to view posts on Rooney's locked private Instagram account, which had only about 300 trusted followers. Rooney's legal team allege Vardy and Watt worked together to pass these private Instagram updates to journalists at the Sun. Sherborne said it was 'quite clear' Watt was monitoring Rooney's private Instagram posts using Vardy's account, and the duo would sometimes discuss Rooney's Instagram updates on WhatsApp. 'You knew what she was doing and you condoned it,' he told Vardy. 'No that's not true,' she replied. At one point the court heard that Rooney had briefly blocked Vardy from the private Instagram. Watt sent a WhatsApp to Vardy, asking: 'Babe, has Coleen unfollowed you?' Vardy replied: 'Oh wow I just saw, wow, what a cunt. I'm going to message her.' Sherborne told the court that it was difficult to know for certain if Watt had sent messages to journalists because Watt's phone - which he wished to search - had fallen off the side of a boat off the Scottish coast. 'We will never know because her phone sits at the bottom of the North Sea,' he told the court. The disclosures were made as part of the libel case Vardy is bringing against Rooney, after Rooney alleged Vardy leaked stories from the private Instagram account to the Sun. Rooney - the wife of Derby County manager Wayne - went public with the accusation in October 2019, claiming to have run a sting operation to find the leaker and concluding: 'It's .......... Rebekah Vardy's account.' Vardy has always maintained the accusation is false and defamatory, and she has brought the libel case in a bid to clear her name. Late in the afternoon, Vardy - who spent the entire day in the witness box - dabbed at her eyes when questioned about the abuse she and her family have received while in the public eye. The proceedings were watched intently by Rooney and her husband, both of whom are expected to later give evidence in the trial. The court also heard accusations that Vardy leaked private information about her husband's then-teammate Riyad Mahrez to the media in 2018, potentially destabilising the players' club, Leicester City. In messages shown to the court, Vardy told her agent: 'Mahrez not turned up to training again, the lads are fuming.' Watt suggested contacting a Sky Sports reporter but Vardy replied: 'I just don't want it coming back on me.' Watt then said 'I can tell someone,' to which Vardy replied: 'Yes, do it.' Sherborne pressed Vardy on whether her husband was the source of the messages about Mahrez: 'Did you or did you not know that the lads were fuming?' Vardy insisted she was just gossiping and did not have a source in the Leicester City changing room. 'Jamie and I never discussed whether the lads were fuming,' she said. The footballer's wife told the high court she did not systematically leak stories to the media and the idea of seeking payment from the Sun for the story about Drinkwater crashing his car was a 'fleeting thought'. She said her real motivation in wanting to leak the story was to expose a drink-driver to public scrutiny. When told by Watt the Sun had already learned about the arrest from a source at the police station, Vardy said she was 'fuming I didn't give it to you earlier'. Watt replied to say 'that would have been a fortune ' and instead suggested finding out where Drinkwater lived and sharing the information with the paparazzi agency Splash News. Vardy's evidence is set to continue on Thursday after it was cut short by a fire alarm.

Sherry Noppe, 63, left her home in Houston, Texas last week, to take her black labrador, Max, for a stroll. The pair never returned. For three days, authorities and volunteers searched for Noppe, who had recently been diagnosed with dementia. They eventually found her next to three-year old Max in George Bush Park, an 8,000-acre expanse next to her home. According to a family friend, Michael England, who joined search efforts, Noppe was found several hundred yards into the park. 'As they got closer to her, I think that's what caused him to bark because he was protecting her,' Sherry Noppe's brother, Justin Noppe, told KHOU. 'So I do think his barking is what led those people to hear him and go in that area and find her. So yes, I do believe he saved her life. 'When they actually found her, they heard him growling and barking.' In a police statement, Constable Ted Heap of Harris county precinct 5, said Sherry Noppe 'was located at approximately 3am on Friday by a group of tireless volunteers and deputies who were alerted by the sound of her dog, Max, barking in the woods'. Aside from a few minor cuts and bruises, Noppe was not injured. She was admitted to hospital with dehydration and was given fluids.

Divers have now pulled out more than 25,000 pounds of debris from the 72 miles of the lake's shoreline, working in a circle from Stateline, Nevada. As volunteer divers navigated the lake, they plucked plastic bottles, engagement rings, 1980s Nikon film cameras, entire lampposts, 'no littering' signs, big pieces of broken-down boats and engine blocks, lost wallets and cordless home telephones, according to Clean Up the Lake. The founder and executive director of the group, Colin West, said he organized a beach cleanup in 2018, when volunteers recovered 40lb of litter from the shoreline near the popular King's Beach. He chatted with some friends who were doing an underwater cleanup and they had recovered 600lbs of litter from beneath the surface. A light went off for him, West says: 'How did all that litter make it under the surface of such a beautiful lake?' His team of volunteers started doing surveys, and they found more than 50lbs of trash a diver each time they went out. They later launched the 72 Mile project to clean up the lake. The divers are supported by boats and jet skis. On any given day, the non-profit organizes 10 people on the water. They have completed 189 dives in 81 days. Lake Tahoe is more than 1,600ft deep in some parts. Pollution from algae and fine sediments have muddied the lake's famously clear blue waters. The lake's clarity declined 30%, from 100 ft to 64 ft, between 1968 and 1997, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. As the climate gets hotter and less rain falls, the lake may also be threatened in unique ways: its waters warmed 15 times faster recently than the average rate over the previous century. Picking up trash will not affect these more systemic issues, but it does make people think more about the ecology of the area, the group says. The divers didn't go deeper than 25 ft to retrieve items, though they geotagged bulkier, deeper trash for later removal. When looking at the litter - including anchors, tires and ropes - it's easy to feel like people are making bad decisions, West said. But the majority of debris is accidental litter that has wound up there through normal human activities. 'You might find five or six beer cans in one area,' he said. 'But the sunglasses, the cellphones, the hats, the construction material - a lot of this has happened accidentally or from wind storms. No one is trying to lose a boat anchor.' Some of the garbage will be used to create a new art installation at a nearby events center. In the future, the project plans to expand to three other lakes, including June Lake in the Mammoth Lakes region and Fallen Leaf Lake in the Tahoe basin. Divers will also be collecting data on invasive species and algae blooms while in the water. They also want to monitor the situation after the cleanup to determine if it has changed for the better, or if it is back to the junk. West wants to see increased litter prevention signs, trash receptacles, and education. 'We are all part of the problem - whether you are on a boat or building a house,' says West. 'So we need to be part of the solution as well.'", "d9e3c8a3eca67a08b0c1efc453d132f8025ae34dcf73d1d36af33e35": "Coral bleaching affected 91% of reefs surveyed along the Great Barrier Reef this year, according to a report by government scientists that confirms the natural landmark has suffered its sixth mass bleaching event on record. The Reef snapshot: summer 2021-22, quietly published by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on Tuesday night after weeks of delay, said above-average water temperatures in late summer had caused coral bleaching throughout the 2,300km reef system, but particularly in the central region between Cape Tribulation and the Whitsundays. 'The surveys confirm a mass bleaching event, with coral bleaching observed at multiple reefs in all regions,' a statement accompanying the report said. 'This is the fourth mass bleaching event since 2016 and the sixth to occur on the Great Barrier Reef since 1998.' It was the first mass bleaching event recorded during a cooler La Nina year. Scientists from the marine park authority and the Australian Institute of Marine Science surveyed 719 shallow water reefs between the Torres Strait and the Capricorn Bunker Group at the southern end of the reef system, mostly using helicopters. They found 654 reefs showed some bleaching. A map published with the report shows the most severe and extreme bleaching occurred in the region that covers the areas most visited by tourists. The report said inshore and offshore reefs were badly affected. Scientists from the marine park authority were not available to comment on the report on Tuesday night. The authority's chief scientist, Dr David Wachenfeld, told the Guardian in March that bleaching was not expected in a La Nina. 'But having said that, the climate is changing and the planet and the reef is about 1.5 degrees centigrade warmer than it was 150 years ago,' he said. 'Because of that, the weather is changing. Unexpected events are now to be expected. Nothing surprises me any more.' Lissa Schindler, a campaign manager with the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the report was 'devastating news for anyone who loves the reef' and 'yet more evidence' cutting fossil fuel emissions should be top priority for the next Australian government. 'This was a La Nina year, normally characterised by more cloud cover and rain,' she said. 'It should have been a welcome reprieve for our reef to help it recover and yet the snapshot shows more than 90% of the reefs surveyed exhibited some bleaching. 'Although bleaching is becoming more and more frequent, this is not normal and we should not accept that this is the way things are. We need to break the norms that are breaking our reef.' Schindler said while Labor had a commitment to make bigger emissions cuts by 2030 than the Coalition, neither party had targets in line with what would be needed globally to save the reef. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found limiting global heating to 1.5C rather than 2C would probably be the difference between the survival of some tropical reef corals and their complete decline. A report by Climate Analytics found the Coalition's 2030 emissions reduction target was consistent with more than 3C of heating and Labor's target about 2C. The director of research at the Climate Council, Dr Simon Bradshaw, said: 'This is an issue that cannot be solved with big shiny funding announcements. The science is very clear: in order to save the world's reefs from total destruction, we must dramatically reduce emissions in the 2020s.' Scientists started raising the alarm for this year's bleaching event in December, when ocean temperatures over the reef hit a record high for that month. Bleaching occurs when the coral becomes stressed from above-average water temperatures. The coral animal expels the photosynthetic algae that lives inside it and provides the coral with food and its colour. Corals can survive bleaching events. Scientists plan to carry out in-water checks to see how many corals survived and regained their algae and colour between now and the end of the year. Studies have shown that heat stress can have several 'sublethal' effects on corals, including making them more susceptible to disease, slowing their growth and limiting their ability to spawn. The results of the surveys are expected to inform a report by a United Nations mission that visited the reef in March to check on its health and management. Scientists from Unesco and the International Union for Conservation of Nature were briefed on the surveys during the 10-day monitoring trip. Their report is due before the next world heritage meeting, currently scheduled for June. Last year, scientific advisors at Unesco recommended the reef be placed on a list of world heritage sites 'in danger' due to the impact of the climate crisis and slow progress on improving water quality. Sustained lobbying from the Morrison government led the 21-country committee to go against that advice. The release of the report and maps follows scientists and conservationists calling on the marine authority to make them public. SBS reported that Paul Hardisty, the chief executive of the Australian Marine Institute of Science, had told a meeting of his staff that the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet advised releasing the survey results during the federal election campaign would have breached caretaker conventions. Conservationists have also called on the government to release the state of the environment report, a five-yearly national assessment that has been sitting with the environment minister, Sussan Ley, since December.", "d1050ca953dac1b59747e824d7330fb837e0e102e8ebb8b5df052c98": "Belgian cartoonist Pieter De Poortere was trying to do his bit for the environment: eating less meat and diligently sorting his rubbish - glass, paper, plastics. He realised it wasn't enough. 'I thought if we all sort out our trash, then everything will be recycled, everything will be OK, then we are doing great. But actually that is not true,' he said pointing to the problems of the global waste industry, where wealthy countries' plastic may be dumped, or burned on open fires in poorer countries. So he put his best-known character to work, as part of an international art project that launched in April, aiming to draw attention to the problem of plastic production. Dickie, a pudgy antihero with a bristly moustache, is a perpetual loser, whether in the guise of farmer, astronaut, fairytale hero, or biblical character. 'I always try to imagine what is the worst possible thing that could happen to Dickie,' said De Poortere of the character he created nearly two decades ago, who now has a permanent home in the Comics Art Museum in Brussels. Known as Boerke in the original Flemish, the series is drawn in a childlike style, but with a spiky black humour aimed squarely at adults. It has won prizes in Belgium, a country where comic strips are celebrated as high art. After years of mishaps, Dickie is now wreaking havoc on the environment - striking a disastrous deal with 'Plastics Inc', or shooting a kangaroo in a misguided attempt at cutting down on packaging waste. 'A lot of my work is very ambiguous,' De Poortere said. 'Dickie is sometimes bad, sometimes he is good, sometimes he is a loser, sometimes he is really greedy, he is selfish, he uses people ... People start reading it and they are laughing, but often they have to think twice, is this really happening?' Camille Duran, founder of the Swedish-based Cosmic Foundation, the organisation behind the Magnify initiative, the art project featuring De Poortere's work, said the aim of the project was to shift people's attention to the production of plastics, not just consumption. 'Even if demand is going to start to decrease as policy gets more ambitious, more [petrochemicals] facilities are getting permitted around the world.' Earlier this year, 173 countries pledged to develop a legally binding treaty by 2024 to end plastic pollution. The agreement, which will include measures to tackle plastic production, has been described as the most significant multilateral environmental accord since the Paris climate deal. Yet on current trends, plastic production is expected to double within the next 20 years and by 2050 could account for 15% of the world's annual carbon budget. Duran, who hopes to expand the project to other parts of the world, began by choosing three artists near some of the world's biggest petrochemical hotspots: Louisiana, Taiwan and Antwerp. The organisers hope the Dickie pages will help galvanise opposition to a giant plastics plant in Antwerp, planned by the British petrochemical company Ineos. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to Antwerp's decision to grant Ineos a permit to build a chemicals installation to make ethylene from fracked US shale gas. The campaigners say the project will fuel single use plastics and fails to meet EU climate targets. Ineos counters that the installation will be the greenest of its kind and will aid the production of long-lasting plastics used in technology and healthcare. De Poortere's sequence on plastics runs throughout May in the Dutch-language weekly Knack. The artist plans to include the pages in a 50-page book covering other environmental emergencies, including global heating, which will be published in 2023. De Poortere, who was born in Ghent, knows Antwerp well, but chose not to locate his work in any particular place, to preserve a universal message. 'It is important to get that message through to the public - and not in an annoying way - but through art, through humour, through trying to convince people, just to make them think. I want to show a bit the absurdity of the reality.' Humans, he added, cannot stop doing 'stupid things that will be harmful to us. There is tragedy in this shortsightedness, but it is also the basis of a lot of humour.'", "1663d4e8e27e75e8fb36dcb81b24d25f7be6c7b3ae76edaf384629c3": "The international aviation industry has failed to meet all but one of 50 of its own climate targets in the past two decades, environment campaigners say. A report commissioned by the climate charity Possible assessed every target set by the industry since 2000 and found that nearly all had been missed, revised or quietly ignored. The charity says the findings undermine a UK government plan to leave airlines to reduce their emissions through self-regulation. Leo Murray, Possible's director of innovation, said: 'This forensic investigation shows just how implausible and credulous the government's jet-zero strategy is shaping up to be. How can we credibly expect this industry to overdeliver on emissions reduction when they've never met any of their previous climate targets? 'It's clear that we need to demand reduction via a frequent flyer levy, which would discourage the frequent flying by a small group of people which makes up the bulk of emissions from planes.' Air travel accounted for 2.1% of human-produced carbon dioxide emissions in 2019, equivalent to about 915m tonnes, according to the Air Transport Action Group. It is estimated that 15% of people take 70% of all flights, Possible says. The air targets report was written by researchers from the sustainability agency Green Gumption, who examined climate targets starting and finishing between 2000 and 2021, and assessed progress against some longer-term goals. They found that unclear definitions, opaque monitoring and inconsistent reporting made many targets difficult to assess, with many also suddenly changed, replaced or dropped within the study period. Moreover, even if the targets had been met, the researchers said, many were insufficiently ambitious to reduce aviation's climate impact. In 2007 Virgin Atlantic set a target of a 30% reduction in CO2 per revenue tonne kilometre (CO2/RTK) by 2020, which the company later described as 'a big target and we're sticking with it', according to the report. In a 2014 sustainability report, with a reduction in CO2/RTK of only 8% from baseline, the airline admitted: 'We're nearly halfway through our target period and know we have to pick up the pace.' But when Virgin's 2020 annual report was published, it no longer mentioned the 2020 target. The following year, a press release from the company announced a new target of 15% gross reduction in CO2/RTK by 2026. The researchers conclude that climate target setting is in effect a smokescreen for business as usual. Such targets 'appear to function principally as a tactic for giving an impression of progress and action to address aviation's environmental impacts to the public and policymakers, in order to prevent any policy barriers to ongoing growth in the industry', the report says. It includes a quote from Steve Ridgway, Virgin's chief executive in 2007, who said: 'It is important that the airline industry is being seen to do something.' The government's jet-zero strategy is due to be published in July and is expected to defy guidance from the climate change committee that deliberate policies will be needed to manage growth in demand for air travel in order to meet the UK's net-zero goals. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: 'This report wilfully ignores this government's historic investment in technology, fuel and market-based measures which will help us reach jet zero by 2050 without the need for further taxes. This includes PS180m to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel and PS685m to develop zero-carbon and low-emission aircraft technology.' The Guardian has contacted Virgin Atlantic for comment.", "f1e0332e2406032e4e0dc22427d373c4e8ba61c239f1bdb7442e4169": "Troops and armoured vehicles have been deployed across the city of Colombo and security officials given orders to shoot on sight anyone deemed to be participating in violence as anti-government protests continued to rock Sri Lanka. The crisis turned volatile earlier this week after pro-government supporters began attacking a camp of peaceful demonstrators who had been protesting against the government and the devastating economic crisis that has engulfed the island of 22 million people. As footage emerged on Wednesday of armoured military vehicles in Colombo and military checkpoints being set up across the country , fears grew that the path was being laid for a military takeover. A nationwide curfew has done nothing to stop protesters gathering to demand the resignation of the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who stands accused of economic mismanagement and corruption that has left it in its worst financial crisis since independence. Security officials confirmed they had been ordered to use 'live ammunition' on those found to be involved in violence or vandalism, alleging that outbreaks of violence were a 'coordinated' campaign. Eight people have been killed and more than 200 injured in the violence that has ensued across the country since Monday's attacks by pro-government supporters. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the brother of the president, who resigned as prime minister on Monday following mounting public pressure, had to be evacuated at dawn on Tuesday from his official residence in Colombo after protesters tried to storm the building. He is currently sheltering at a naval base in the north-eastern city of Trincomalee. More than 100 buildings were set alight, including the homes of 41 pro-Rajapaksa politicians and a luxury hotel said to be owned by the Rajapaksas, as well as several buses that had been rumoured to be used as transport for pro-Rajapaksa supporters. The resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa on Monday means the government has been dissolved and there is no cabinet. The opposition refused to form a proposed 'unity government' until Gotabaya Rajapaksa agreed to step down within a stipulated period and abolish the system of executive presidency. Forming an interim government is a matter of urgency for Sri Lanka, both to ensure the country's economic situation does not worsen further and to continue vital negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, which the country is relying on for financial support and billions in emergency loans. The central bank chief warned on Wednesday that Sri Lanka's economy will 'collapse' unless a new government is urgently appointed and said he would resign if an interim prime minister wasn't appointed within days. In an address to the nation on Wednesday night, Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he would appoint a new prime minister and cabinet within the week and promised to take steps towards abolishing the executive presidency, as was demanded by the opposition. However, he stopped short of resigning. 'After the country is stable under the new Government, I will speak to everyone and create an environment for the abolishment of the executive presidency,' said Rajapaksa.  Many expressed concern that the military might try to step into the power vacuum left by the dissolved parliament. But speaking at a news conference, the defence ministry's top official, Kamal Gunaratne, denied allegations of a military takeover. 'None of our officers have a desire to take over the government. It has never happened in our country and it is not easy to do it here,' said Gunaratne. Sajith Premadasa, the leader of the main opposition SJP party who has refused to participate in a government under the Rajapaksas, accused the government of orchestrating mob violence in order to bring in martial law. 'In the guise of angry mobs, violence is being incited so military rule can be established,' he said. 'Rule of law should be maintained through the constitution, not with guns. It is time to empower citizens, not disempower them.' The US state department expressed concern over the military deployment in Sri Lanka. 'We stress that peaceful protesters should never be subjected to violence or intimidation, whether that's on the part of the military force or civilian units,' said a spokesperson, Ned Price. On Wednesday, Pope Francis appealed for calm in Sri Lanka and for authorities to 'listen to the aspirations of the people'. 'I offer a special thought to the people of Sri Lanka, in particular to the young, who in recent times have made their cry heard in the face of the country's social and economic challenges and problems,' he said at the end of his weekly audience.", "5e48fa7932d46cd41ca318fadf04a3ce0f2b5b90d77ec6a2c66d8296": "An Al Jazeera reporter has been killed by Israeli army gunfire in the occupied West Bank, the Qatar-based news channel said. Israel's military said she may have been shot by Palestinians as they clashed with its troops. One Palestinian official said Shireen Abu Akleh had been 'assassinated' by Israeli forces while reporting on a raid in the city of Jenin, which has seen intensified army raids in recent weeks as violence has surged. The Palestinian health ministry confirmed Abu Akleh's death and said a second reporter, Ali Samodi, had been wounded. In a statement, the Israeli military said its troops had shot back after coming under 'massive fire' in Jenin and that 'there is a possibility, now being looked into, that reporters were hit - possibly by shoots fired by Palestinian gunmen'. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said he held the Israeli military fully responsible for her death. Qatar's deputy foreign minister condemned what he called the killing of a reporter by 'Israeli occupation' and in a Twitter post called for an end to 'state sponsored Israeli terrorism'.", "08f77eaf0c06c25c6b0349afc936d7c3c4e0ac19a9271f667df5d4a8": "A Dutch court has sentenced 11 men to between one and nine years for maintaining an 'underworld prison' with a torture chamber, hidden in shipping containers, in a case that shocked the Netherlands. The case revolved around seven containers found by police almost two years ago in a southern Dutch forest, following up on information from a hack of the European-wide EncroChat encrypted phone system, popular with criminal gangs. During the raid, police found one of the containers was kitted out with a dentist's chair, along with pruning shears, a saw, scalpels and pliers. The other six containers were set up to be prison cells. 'The court found that the suspects all contributed to a plan to kidnap, ransom, blackmail, torture and kill criminal opponents or their relatives,' the Amsterdam district court said in a statement on Wednesday. 'The men formed a group based on a fight over money in the criminal world and planned to take the law into their own hands. The lack of respect for the personal freedom and integrity of others is shocking.'  Dutch media named the chief suspect as Roger P, 50, known by his underworld name 'Piet Costa' - allegedly because he often travelled to Costa Rica. Costa, who was jailed last month for 15 years for cocaine trafficking, was handed an additional 33-month sentence. Judges jailed his 40-year-old righthand man for eight years. Nine other men were also sentenced and one was acquitted. Dutch police discovered the prison complex after hacking the EncroChat encrypted system in 2020, and judges ruled that evidence from the system was admissible in court. The criminals sent chat messages via EncroChat, including saying 'we must have enough belts and tie-wraps to tie them' and 'we need cutting pliers for fingers and toes'. During the trial, one public prosecutor said that the evidence should remind recreational cocaine users of the consequences of their habits, a Dutch prosecutor has said. In a hearing in February, Koos Plooij told the court that the violence of the drug trade was a 'repulsive, but apparently unavoidable' result of the widespread use of illegal drugs in the Netherlands and neighbouring countries. 'The question is how many people are willing to admit that there is indeed a connection between their cocaine use - whether it is to party, deal with work stress or suppress psychological problems - and the underworld that is happy to answer demand but according to its own rules: corrupting, undermining, tough, sparing nothing and nobody,' Plooij said.", "e9f4398d4df3b4913959b0fd4a705eb86e130aecc5838b8344c34164": "A US judge has determined that Elon Musk's 2018 tweets that funding had been secured to take electric car maker Tesla private was inaccurate and reckless, saying 'there was nothing concrete' about financing from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund at that time. San Francisco-based US district judge Edward Chen's pre-trial decision represented a major victory for investors in a lawsuit accusing the world's richest person of inflating stock prices by making false and misleading statements, causing billions of dollars in damages. Chen granted the shareholders summary judgment on the issue of whether Musk knowingly made false statements but declined to grant them summary judgment on the question of whether these statements actually impacted Tesla's share prices. In 2018, Musk met with representatives of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and had a discussion about taking Tesla private, but evidence showed that 'there was nothing concrete about funding coming from the PIF', the judge wrote. 'Rather, discussions between Tesla and the PIF were clearly at the preliminary stage,' Chen said. 'No reasonable jury could find that Mr Musk did not act recklessly given his clear knowledge of the discussions,' the judge added. Chen said details such as the total amount of funding needed to take Tesla private or the price to be paid for Tesla stock were not discussed. The summary judgment, made on 1 April, was sealed for more than a month before it was made publicly available on Tuesday. 'It is hugely significant,' shareholder attorney Nicholas Porritt, a partner at Levi & Korsinsky LLP told Reuters. Porritt said it is rare that a judge decides that a defendant knowingly made false statements in summary judgment before a jury trial begins. The remaining issue is what damages the intentionally false statement has caused to shareholders, Porritt said. Musk's lawyer, who has filed motions to undo the court decision, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk last month said that funding was actually secured to take Tesla private in 2018. Chen's ruling was in line with a complaint from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The securities regulator in 2018 sued Musk for fraud relating to the tweets. Musk then settled with the SEC, stepping down as Tesla chairman, paying fines and agreeing to have a lawyer approve some of his tweets before posting them.", "88ddd450ddb107c3a51d543572c26784a871d26a5a43a2370ea9d18f": "Twenty women have come forward to openly accuse one of France's best-known television news presenters of sexual harassment and abuse - including rape - following an investigation by French journalists. Patrick Poivre d'Arvor - known as PPDA - has faced a number of accusations that emerged after a writer first went to police to accuse him of rape, in February last year. The investigation was later dropped. The news presenter responded by announcing last month he was taking legal action against 16 women who spoke to detectives for 'slanderous denunciation'. On Tuesday, the investigative website Mediapart interviewed 18 women - 16 of them prepared to be named and filmed for the programme PPDA: 30 Years of Silence, and two who were present but hid their faces. A further two alleged victims were named and filmed talking of their encounters with the television star separately. The majority of the alleged sexual offences, which reportedly began in 1980, are now beyond the time limit for criminal proceedings under French law. Two of the alleged victims, who are now aged between 28 and 63 years, were minors at the time. Many of the alleged assaults reportedly took place in the presenter's office at the television station after he had finished reading the prime-time news. Poivre d'Arvor, 74, has always denied any wrongdoing and insisted his relations with the women were consensual and part of a ritual of 'seduction' involving no violence or constraint. He has described the allegations as 'false from beginning to end'. A preliminary police investigation was launched in February last year when writer and journalist Florence Porcel, 38, accused Poivre d'Arvor of two counts of rape in 2004 and 2009. The investigation was dropped four months later as a judge said there was insufficient evidence on either side to press charges and the allegations were beyond the legal time limit. However, media coverage of Porcel's accusation led to 22 other women coming forward to give evidence to the police. Seventeen of them lodged formal complaints, eight of them alleging rape, but the cases fell outside the time limit for prosecutions under French law and were not pursued. Three other cases are under investigation. Mediapart journalist Marine Turchi said the women had not met as a group before the programme was recorded and most had never spoken publicly before. Most of them said they had not spoken out at the time of the alleged assaults and rapes - except in some cases to family and friends - because they were afraid they would not be believed or that doing so would damage their careers. Nonce Paolini, the former chief executive of TF1, who ended Poivre d'Arvor's contract in 2008, told Mediapart he had not known of the alleged abuse and harassment, which he described as 'revolting'. 'If we'd known anything, there would have been punishment. Obviously we didn't know,' he said. Paolini added: 'I want to tell these women that their suffering cannot leave anyone indifferent, especially not me either as a man, or as the former head [of the company]. I hope they will be able to get their cases reviewed by the courts.' Porcel said the women had formed a support group. 'We wanted to show that we are united, that we are solid, that we are facing this together and that Patrick Poivre d'Arvor no longer makes us afraid. It seems also important to say I'm still standing and I intend to continue standing.' Porcel is pursuing further legal action against Poivre d'Arvor. Teacher Margaux Coquil-Gleizes described how she met Poivre d'Arvor when she was 17 and an aspiring novelist. She said he invited her to his hotel room. 'I was young, naive, impressionable, flattered by the attention that Poivre d'Arvor was going to pay to my writing.' Once in the room she said the television star 'pushed me on the bed, he undressed, he took my clothes off and penetrated me. At the time I was paralysed. It took a very long time for me to realise that it was a rape by surprise.' Journalist Justine Ducharne said she did not want to discuss details of what happened to her but described it as 'a horror'. Last year, Poivre d'Arvor accused the women of hiding behind anonymity. 'Nobody has dared come forward, face to face, to tell me what I did was not acceptable.' He did not accept Mediapart's invitation to take part in the two-hour programme. In his 43-page legal complaint for slander against 16 of his accusers, Poivre d'Arvor deplored 'a return to puritanism and censorship cleverly dressed up as the supposed protection of women'. He said: 'Since the excitement generated by the #MeToo wave, the liberation of women's voices has unfortunately had its share of excesses and abuses.' He also claimed the women were seeking fame and revenge. 'No credit can be given to these 16 women, journalists or writers in search of fame who have become sudden feminists to support a former colleague, a friend, or even a simple activist for the women's cause,' he said. 'It is all about revenge on the part of women who have not received more consideration, or even a glance, from a man they once admired. '[This] makes the rejected or ignored respondents very bitter today, a bitterness that leads them to commit, out of belated revenge, the crime of slanderous denunciation.' Turchi said Poivre d'Arvor and his lawyers had been approached to take part in the programme. 'We would have liked him to express himself and we asked him to do so, but he refused,' she said. Poivre d'Arvor's lawyer, Philippe Naepels, had not responded to the Guardian at the time of writing.", "34ea5519dc40c5bf3b4b51de46620398a94707163da3bea0dd594cb6": "Liz Truss has been warned of a major rebellion over plans for a bill that could revoke parts of the Northern Ireland protocol, amid fresh concern in Washington over the UK's approach. European Union insiders have warned that the British government's threat to abandon parts of the Northern Ireland protocol risks undermining the international alliance against Vladimir Putin. Officials in Brussels were 'flabbergasted' at the timing of an intervention from the UK foreign secretary, who issued a statement on Tuesday night saying she would 'not shy away' from taking unilateral action on the protocol. The bill, which is expected to be discussed by cabinet ministers on Thursday, could be revealed next Tuesday.  Doubling down on Truss's remarks, Michael Gove warned the EU that 'no option is off the table', after the UK argued the solution put forward by Brussels last October would worsen food shortages. According to a report in the Times the attorney general, Suella Braverman, has approved the plans to scrap swathes of the protocol - a move which would grant Boris Johnson a legal green light to move ahead. In her submission, Braverman reportedly cited the Good Friday agreement as having a greater significance than the protocol, but says that it is being undermined by the trade barrier in the Irish Sea and rising civil unrest. Between 30 and 50 Conservative MPs canvassed by colleagues said they had significant doubts about whether they could vote for a bill that would unpick an international treaty. Most dismissed the prospect of the bill's success and described it as a negotiating tactic. Senior MPs warned there were a number of ministers prepared to resign if faced with passing the bill into law. Sources close to Truss have stressed that no final decision has been made and that any potential legislation is intended to run in parallel with further talks. The Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns, styled under a new title of special representative to the US on the NI protocol, was dispatched to Washington this week to speak to senior US figures about the negotiations. They were reported to have been blindsided by the leak of the proposed bill to the Times earlier this week. Burns arrived in Boston on Monday before travelling to DC for meetings with the Department of State and the senior director at the National Security Council, Amanda Sloat, as well as some senators and representatives from the influential Friends of Ireland group. One source described Burns as being keen to point out his close friendship with Johnson. A White House spokesperson said: 'We recognise that there have been challenges over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol and that talks continue between the UK and EU to resolve these issues. 'President Biden has long made clear his strong support for the Belfast/Good Friday agreement. We underscore our continued support for a secure and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a voice and enjoy the gains of the hard-won peace.' In Westminster, MPs said there was already a strong opposition forming against the principle of the bill, but said most were prepared to stomach difficult negotiating tactics. But they said they expected senior voices to speak out if it went ahead, including one ex-minister who said the former prime minister Theresa May would go further than she had over the internal markets bill which had provoked a number of resignations but was pulled last year. May made a stern intervention on the plans in the House of Commons and MPs described her comments as 'opening fire' for more widespread Tory concern. Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence select committee, said there was widespread concern about the proposed legislation. 'Abandoning the protocol is self-defeating. It plays into Sinn Fein's narrative that a united, peaceful Ireland is better for Northern Ireland,' he told the Guardian. 'Binning the protocol will provoke a trade war with the EU at a time when the UK has done so well in leading the European response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It will mean fewer movements of goods and higher inflation.' Most MPs said they would wait to see how much the proposed bill was a device to reignite negotiations. Another MP said there was 'huge difference between making preparatory steps as a negotiating tactic which some would understand - and going as far as to whip colleagues to break from an international treaty'. A third said: 'As long as it's posturing, it's tolerable. If they go through with breaking the protocol, there will be opposition.' Another former minister said they believed Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, had significant concerns about escalatory action by the EU - which has said it could suspend the free trade agreement. 'The last thing the Treasury needs is that pressure on supply chains.' EU leaders have also voiced alarm. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign affairs minister, said Truss's briefing to the press had gone down 'really badly' in Europe, warning that unilateral action would potentially plunge the UK into a trade war with the EU. The EU had been expecting UK ministers to ramp up their approach after the public comments from Johnson and Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg about bringing forward 'reforms'. Broadly, the threats were seen as sabre-rattling designed to achieve leverage for the UK side ahead of the resumption of talks between Truss and the EU's Maros Sefcovic. But relations deteriorated on Wednesday, with Coveney saying the 'partnership' that has kept Northern Ireland stable is 'absent at the moment'. Speaking on a visit to Sweden, Johnson told BBC News there was no need for major EU retaliation. His spokesperson declined to say if the government had modelled the potential economic cost of a trade war. Talks between the UK and the EU about the protocol are about to resume following a pause for the Northern Ireland elections. If the UK abandoned the protocol, the EU could take legal action and restart previous litigation against the UK that the European Commission paused last July, as well as potentially imposing tariffs on British goods or even suspending the EU-UK free-trade agreement.", "c99cdc25d177ebe22c57a66c027d67a6bb929a1b824224e790b7bd79": "The Vatican has voiced concern after Hong Kong's national security police arrested 90-year-old Cardinal Joseph Zen, one of Asia's most senior and outspoken Catholic clerics. Zen, a former bishop of Hong Kong, was arrested along with the singer and actor Denise Ho, the lawyer Margaret Ng, and the scholar Hui Po-keung. 'The Holy See has learnt the news of Cardinal Zen's arrest with concern and is following the development of the situation very closely,' the Vatican said in a statement. Local reports earlier suggested the arrests were related to their roles as trustees of the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, which provided legal aid and other financial help to people who took part in the 2019 pro-democracy protests that were quashed by security forces. Hui was arrested at the airport as he was about to board a flight to Germany on Tuesday, local media reported. Another trustee, Cyd Ho, is already in jail for her alleged involvement in illegal assemblies. Late on Wednesday evening, Hong Kong's police confirmed the arrest on Tuesday and Wednesday of two men and two women, aged 45 to 90, for alleged 'collusion with foreign forces'. The force said that all had been released on bail but had their passports forfeited under the national security legislation. Last year, the city's police department said in a statement that it was investigating the charity for suspected violations of the national security law. The fund has now been scrapped after the disbandment of a company that had helped receive donations through a bank account. Hui, a former adjunct associate professor of cultural studies at Lingnan University, had once taught the exiled political activist Nathan Law. 'If you want to punish someone, you can always find an excuse,' Law, who now lives in Britain, wrote on his Facebook page in response to Hui's arrest. In 2020, Cardinal Zen made a personal appeal to the Vatican in a letter, urging Pope Francis to leave politics out of the selection of Catholic bishops in the Chinese territory. He did not manage to meet the pope because, according to local media, the Holy See was at the time engaged in discussions with Beijing on the renewal of a power-sharing agreement on the ordination of bishops in the Chinese mainland. This week's arrests were the authorities' latest move in enforcing the controversial national security law, which was imposed on the city in June 2020. The legislation bars secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces. They also came less than a week after the incoming chief executive, John Lee, was selected by a small number of elite voters on Sunday. Although Beijing and Hong Kong authorities insisted the national security law had brought stability to Hong Kong after the 2019 mass demonstrations, activists pointed out that since the enactment of the legislation, at least 175 people have been arrested and more than 110 have been charged. Responding to the latest arrests, the White House spokesperson, Karine Jean-Peirre, urged the authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong to release Zen and the others who had been detained. In the UK, Labour's shadow minister for Asia and Pacific, Catherine West, said in a tweet that the arrests 'are a further demonstration of China's aim to stamp out opposition in Hong Kong, and are completely at odds with the freedoms promised to Hong Kong'. She urged the British government to 'work with international partners to demand the release of those detained'. Maya Wang, Human Rights Watch's China senior researcher, said arresting Zen for his peaceful activities 'has to be a shocking new low for Hong Kong, illustrating the city's free fall in human rights in the past two years'. The arrests were condemned by US politicians, with Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a member of the senate intelligence committee, saying it showed the ruling Communist party and its leader, Xi Jinping, were 'afraid of truth-tellers and labels them threats to national security. [Xi is] absolutely terrified of a 90-year old Catholic cardinal. Xi is a pathetic coward.'

While running for a student council role in the mid-1990s, the Walthamstow MP said she was reprimanded by college authorities instead of action being taken against the men involved. 'I'm in my mid-40s now and it's the first time I've really felt even willing to talk about it,' Creasy said in an interview with the broadcaster and former Labour MP Gloria De Piero for GB News. 'It was terrifying at the time, I'm terrified I'll ever run into those young men again.' There have been a slew of revelations about sexism and harassment in Westminster, and up to 56 MPs have been accused of sexual misconduct. But Creasy, a prominent campaigner for women's rights, including granting mothers the resources to run for parliament, said a culture of 'privilege and entitlement' was not unique to parliament but a problem in universities as well. 'It's always the men that people think are least likely to do it who are involved in it,' she said. She said she had experienced sexual harassment 'all my life' and she remained terrified of seeing the men who had threatened her at university, who she said had gone on to be doctors, civil servants and 'high flyers'. After running into the men several years after the incident, she said, she collapsed to a bar floor and left as soon as she could. Creasy said the abuse would always affect her. She said her first experience of sexual harassment was during her first year at Magdalene College and lasted from 1996 to 1998. She said it included a campaign of abusive posters when she ran for the role of president of the college's student council. 'I'll never forget the night that I was in a room with them all and they threatened to gang-rape me, let alone the posters that they put up around the college when I had the temerity to stand for a position in the student union, telling people not to vote for me because of who I'd slept with,' she said. 'And that happened at a Cambridge college. 'I was held up and I was admonished by the college authorities at the time because they chose to believe the idea that I was probably 'a wronged woman',' she said. 'And, as I say, it took public humiliation, and posters, and finally other people coming forward, and me collating the evidence - of all the notes, the spitting in my room, the rubbish that was thrown at me, the sexual abuse and harassment if I tried to walk into the bar, that came from this group of young men.' Creasy studied psychology at Cambridge from 1996 to 1999, going on to gain a PhD from the London School of Economics. She entered the Commons in 2010. Addressing women with similar experiences, and those in parliament, she said: 'You will find allies, you will find those of us prepared to stand with you because we know what it's like, we know how hard it is and we know the impact it can have on you.' A Cambridge spokesperson said: 'We are extremely sorry to hear of the horrific ordeal which Stella Creasy experienced. Sexual harassment of any sort has absolutely no place at the university. In recent years the university has taken significant steps in order to provide support for victims of sexual misconduct, to improve systems for reporting any incidents, and to take action as a result. 'We urge anyone who experiences any form of harassment or abuse to report it so that they can be offered support and action can be taken. The university employs a sexual assault and harassment adviser to provide specialist support to victims.'", "f7b8d498e3ec78299807522bab8cfb34631671167d6f0add0fb0694e": "Babis Anagnostopoulos, the Greek pilot accused of killing his British wife as she slept in their Athens home, had waited for his moment in court and, a year to the day after she took her last breath, he got it. For almost 10 hours on Wednesday the UK-trained aviator stood in the dock relating the alleged events that led to the fatal moment on 11 May 2021 when he 'lost control' and smothered Caroline Crouch, 20, to death with a pillow. The body of the couple's dog was was also found in the entrance of the building. No detail was too small for the court now tasked with determining whether the 34-year-old Greek should spend the next two decades in prison for a crime that has gripped the country. 'There is no excuse [for my actions] ... what has been lost is irreplaceable. Neither Caroline nor our dog deserved it,' he told the three-member panel of presiding judges at the start of the deposition. 'There are not enough times that I can say sorry. I will tell you in detail, and sincerely, what exactly happened.' During his testimony, Anagnostopoulos spoke of what he called his unwavering love for the student he had met on the island of Alonissos when she was 15. Over the course of their four-year relationship, the couple had enjoyed 'fairytale' times including an idyllic, spur-of-the moment wedding in Portugal 'that you only see in films'. 'My absolute priority in everything was her happiness,' he said describing his joy when Caroline, who had previously suffered a miscarriage, gave birth to their daughter Lydia. 'She may have been younger but she was very mature and she was maturing fast.' The judge repeatedly interjected, cajoling the defendant - described by psychologists who had also testified in the court as 'narcissistic and controlling' - for speaking of his wife in the present 'when she is dead and cannot be brought back' and urging him not to 'overanalyse'. For 37 days Anagnostopoulos had tried to pin the murder on a botched break-in by ruthless foreign thieves, prompting police to speak of the pilot's skills as a consummate actor. On Wednesday his self-described goal was to prove that Crouch's death had not been premeditated but was instead the result of his being in a 'blurred state of mind' that should be considered a crime of passion and treated more leniently. He had previously attempted to lay the blame on the Briton's 'dangerous outbursts' saying he had also been a victim of her physical abuse when, in heated moments, she had lunged out and 'punched and kicked me'. On the night in question, he had got especially angry, he recalled, when she refused to apologise for her part in a row and had threatened to hit their daughter - who he subsequently placed next to her dead mother's body. 'I got on top of her [in the couple's bed] so she couldn't hit me so easily,' he told the Athens court, saying he believed he had been pushed to the edge by the woman he had otherwise loved. 'I told her to calm down ... she was saying 'get up, leave me, go away' and other swear words which I'd rather not say. Then I took my pillow and I placed it over her head.' When asked by the judge how such love could suddenly transition into such violence he responded: 'I had no purpose. There was no logic in my blurred mind at that moment ... and when I saw her in profile and understood she was dead from her eyes which were open and her pulse, I lost it, I began to weep and pull my hair and go back and forth across the room ... from the day I lost Caroline I lost everything, I lost my life. ' Anagnostopoulos - the son of a schoolteacher and civil engineer - stands accused of premeditated murder, the unprovoked killing of an animal and perverting the course of justice by repeatedly lying to police - charges that carry life in prison. On Wednesday, he conceded he had hung Caroline's seven-month-old puppy, Roxy, from the banister of the couple's two-storey maisonette to make the crime look more credible. 'It was impossible to look, I left and went into the kitchen so I couldn't see or hear [it die].' The defendant broke down and wept on Tuesday when excerpts of Crouch's handwritten diary were read out to the court.  His closing words to the court were: 'I hope all those who have been hurt, all those who have lost, will some day forgive me. I hope that God will forgive me. I will never forgive myself.' Crouch had described her feelings of powerlessness in a marriage that had increasingly left her feeling trapped and suffocated. She was the 17th woman to be murdered at the hands of a partner in Greece last year. The court will reconvene on Monday, when it is likely to issue its verdict.", "b2ece87c4f56b8c0de8b6bf187ea451cf90abcf73dbe284c8e859640": "An Arizona man convicted of killing a college student in 1978 was killed by the state on Wednesday after a nearly eight-year hiatus in its use of the death penalty, brought on by an execution critics say was botched and difficulty in finding lethal drugs. Clarence Dixon, 66, died by lethal injection at the state prison in Florence for his conviction in the killing of 21-year-old Arizona State University student Deana Bowdoin. He was the sixth person to be executed in the US in 2022. Dixon's death was announced by Frank Strada, a deputy director with Arizona department of corrections, rehabilitation and re-entry. The execution appeared to go smoothly, said Troy Hayden, an anchor for the Fox10 TV news program who witnessed it. 'Once the drugs started flowing, he went to sleep almost immediately,' Hayden said. Dixon's lawyers made last-minute arguments to the courts to postpone his execution, but judges rejected the argument that he was not mentally fit to be executed and did not have a rational understanding of why the state wanted to execute him. The US supreme court rejected a last-minute delay of Dixon's execution less than an hour before it began. Dixon declined the option of being killed in the gas chamber - a method that has not been used in the US in more than two decades - after Arizona refurbished its chamber in late 2020. He was executed with an injection of pentobarbital. Strada said Dixon's last statement was: 'The Arizona supreme court should follow the laws. They denied my appeals and petitions to change the outcome of this trial. I do and will always proclaim innocence. Now, let's do this [expletive].' The last time Arizona executed a prisoner was in July 2014, when Joseph Wood was given 15 doses of a two-drug combination over two hours in an execution his lawyers said was botched. Wood snorted repeatedly and gasped more than 600 times before he died. States including Arizona have struggled to buy execution drugs after US and European pharmaceutical companies began blocking the use of their products in lethal injections. Authorities have said Bowdoin, who was found dead in her apartment in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe, was raped, stabbed and strangled with a belt. Dixon, who was an ASU student at the time and lived across the street, was charged with raping Bowdoin but the charge was later dropped on statute-of-limitation grounds. He was convicted of murder. In arguing that Dixon was mentally unfit, his lawyers said he erroneously believed he would be executed because police at Northern Arizona University wrongfully arrested him in another case - a 1985 attack on a 21-year-old student. His attorneys conceded he was lawfully arrested by Flagstaff police. Dixon was sentenced to life in prison in that case for sexual assault and other convictions. DNA samples taken in prison linked him to the killing of Bowdoin. Prosecutors said there was nothing about Dixon's beliefs that prevented him from understanding the reason for the execution and pointed to court filings Dixon made. Defense lawyers said Dixon was repeatedly diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, regularly experienced hallucinations and was found 'not guilty by reason of insanity' in a 1977 assault case in which the verdict was delivered by then-Maricopa county superior court judge Sandra Day O'Connor, nearly four years before her appointment to the US supreme court. Bowdoin was killed two days after that verdict, according to court records. Another Arizona death-row prisoner, Frank Atwood, is scheduled to be executed on 8 June in the killing of eight-year-old Vicki Lynne Hoskinson in 1984. Authorities have said Atwood kidnapped the girl. The child's remains was discovered in the desert north-west of Tucson nearly seven months after her disappearance. Experts could not determine the cause of death from the bones that were found, according to court records. Arizona has 112 prisoners on death row.", "4d08099d9318a3524b79a264dd37b2ab33d85ce059bbe991b165efcb": "", "7ac91ba33e2b6d5c75ac85ad5d84551e4136fa23272111ef3d4e7d47": "", "5885c41fcd40158b1ffbde77e1cd2ad25b9b958d093f2fcbd4f0b486": "", "39201d19cf285d88c4765d3a3860b6f561939d48151f6a5b5ec54ee5": "", "912ad5f280062ca9c1633a258431f322f901a56ab779f55072c86481": "", "ab45633b8f35f593eb945104c074cfefb8453085a7efbaa766ddf764": "", "5f6b17670649521c7d4f07fc9a9c32a576ee33cec5f67adda4a5a7e1": "", "f0b8389537c940e6f38a0b4670487ac464a0f504c71790bfbdc0645d": "", "a610a073267a96019b511840d9ddad852b570035572bb217b593c42d": "", "beab957af4137d9ad31e81c2fe7313c59c5c72802fefab1a161ea24f": "", "4d7c9701f5d98e9f326a2ca5c914cd176c8f5aa60d2a10d320119216": "Martin Burch had been working for the Wall Street Journal and its parent company Dow Jones for a few years and was looking for new opportunities. One Sunday in May 2021, he applied for a data analyst position at Bloomberg in London that looked like the perfect fit. He received an immediate response, asking him to take a digital assessment. It was strange. The assessment showed him different shapes and asked him to figure out the pattern. He started feeling incredulous. 'Shouldn't we be testing my abilities on the job?' he asked himself. The next day, a Monday, which happened to be a public holiday in the UK, he got a rejection email. He decided to email a recruiter at Bloomberg. Maybe the company made a mistake? What Burch discovered offers insight into a larger phenomenon that is baffling experts: while there are record level job openings in both the UK and in the US, why do many people still have to apply to sometimes hundreds of jobs, even in sought-after fields like software development, while many companies complain they can't find the right talent? Some experts argue that algorithms and artificial intelligence now used extensively in hiring are playing a role. This is a huge shift, because until relatively recently, most hiring managers would handle applications and resumes themselves. Yet recent findings have shown that some of these new tools discriminate against women and use criteria unrelated to work to 'predict' job success. While companies and vendors are not required to disclose if they use artificial intelligence or algorithms to select and hire job applicants, in my reporting I have learned that this is widespread. All the leading job platforms - including LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Indeed, CareerBuilder, and Monster - have told me they deploy some of these technologies. Ian Siegel, the CEO of ZipRecruiter, said that artificial intelligence and algorithms have already conquered the field. He estimates that at least three-quarters of all resumes submitted for jobs in the US are read by algorithms. 'The dawn of robot recruiting has come and went and people just haven't caught up to the realization yet,' he said. A 2021 survey of recruiting executives by the research and consulting firm Gartner found that almost all reported using AI for at least one part of the recruiting and hiring process.  Yet it is not foolproof. One of the most consequential findings comes from Harvard Business School professor Joe Fuller, whose team surveyed more than 2,250 business leaders in the US, UK and Germany. Their motives for using algorithmic tools were efficiency and saving costs. Yet 88% of executives said that they know their tools reject qualified candidates. Despite the prevalence of the technology, there have just been a few famous cases of misfires. A few years back, Amazon discovered that its resume screener tool was biased against women. The algorithm was trained on resumes of current employees, who skewed male, reflecting a gender disparity in many tech fields. Over time, the tool picked up on male preferences and systematically downgraded people with the word 'women' on their resumes, as in 'women's chess club' or 'women's soccer team.' Amazon's engineers tried to fix the problem, but they couldn't and the company discontinued the tool in 2018. 'This project was only ever explored on a trial basis, and was always used with human supervision,' said Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser. AI vendors that build these kinds of technologies say that algorithm-based tools democratize the hiring process by giving everyone a fair chance. If a company is drowning in applications, many human recruiters read only a fraction of the applications. An AI analyzes all of them and any assessments and judges every candidate the same way. Another benefit, these vendors say, is if employers choose to focus on skills and not on educational achievements like college degrees, applicants from diverse backgrounds who are often overlooked can get to the next stage of the process. 'At the end of the day, we don't want people to be hired into roles that are going to drain them and not utilize their strengths. And so it's really not about rejecting people, it's about 'screening in' the right people,' said Caitlin MacGregor, CEO of Plum, which built the assessment Burch found so puzzling. MacGregor said the company's clients have increased their diversity and retention rates since they started to use Plum. She said the assessments helped hone in on applicants' 'potential'. But job candidates who have the necessary experience worry they're being unfairly weeded out when companies focus on elusive factors like potential or personality traits. 'This was the first time in my life, in my career, where I was sending out resumes and there was nothing,' said Javier Alvarez, 57, a distribution and sales manager from Monrovia, California, who sent out his resume more than 300 times on sites like LinkedIn and Indeed for jobs he said he was qualified for. No job offer materialized, and he started to wonder if he was being automatically excluded in some way - perhaps because of his age or salary requirements. 'I felt hopeless. I started to doubt my abilities.' Ronnie Riley, a 29-year-old event planner from Canada, had a gap of several years in their resume because of an illness. Riley applied to more than 100 event planning and some administrative assistant jobs in December 2021, and over 70 jobs in January, but ended up with a total of five interviews and no job offers. They worry the gap is the reason. 'It just seems it's discounting a whole bunch of people that could be perfect for the job,' they said. Fuller's research has helped provide answers to how exactly automatic rejections occur. One reason, he found, is that too often, job descriptions include too many criteria and skills. Many employers add new skills and criteria to existing job descriptions, building a long list of requirements. Algorithms end up rejecting many qualified applicants who may be missing just a couple of skills from the list. One executive Fuller spoke with said their company's tool has been rejecting qualified candidates because they scored low in one important category, even when they got a near perfect score in all the other important categories. The company found that it was left with job applicants who received mediocre scores across the board. (Longer job descriptions may also deter more female applicants, Fuller believes, since many women apply to jobs only when they fulfill most of the requirements.) Another reason qualified candidates are rejected by automated systems are so-called knockout criteria. In Fuller's research, he found that almost 50% of the executives surveyed acknowledged that their automatic systems reject job applicants outright who have a work gap longer than six months on their resumes. These applicants never get in front of a hiring manager, even if they are the most qualified candidates for the job. 'The six month gap is a really insidious filter,' said Fuller, since it's probably built on the assumption that a gap signifies something ominous, but may simply represent military deployments, pregnancy complications, caregiving obligations or illness. Experts contacted by the Guardian also described automatic resume screeners making mistakes similar to the infamous Amazon example, rooted in learning biases from an existing dataset. This hints at how these programs could end up enforcing the kinds of racial and gender biases observed with other AI tools, such as facial recognition tech and algorithms used in health care. John Scott is the chief operating officer of APMetrics, an organization that helps companies identify talent, and is often brought in by larger companies to check if new technologies the company wants to buy from a vendor are fair and legal. Scott has examined multiple resume screeners and recruiting tools and discovered problems in all of them. He found biased criteria unrelated to work, such as the name Thomas and the keyword church, to 'predict' success in a job. Mark Girouard, an employment lawyer in Minneapolis, found that the name Jared and having played lacrosse in high school were used as predictors of success in one system. Martin Burch, the London jobseeker, discovered he had been weeded out in a different way. He contacted a human recruiter at Bloomberg and asked her to look at his CV. His experience lined up with the job description and this was a direct competitor, making his background all the more valuable, he thought. But the problem turned out to be the pattern-finding and personality test he had taken, which was created by Plum. A recruiter at Bloomberg replied: 'I can see that your application was rejected due to not meeting our benchmark in the Plum assessment that you completed. Unfortunately on that basis we are not able to take your application any further.' Burch felt stunned that he had indeed been rejected by a piece of code. He retained a lawyer, and in communications with Bloomberg asked for a human review of his application. Bloomberg informed Burch that the role he applied for was no longer available and he wouldn't be able to be considered for it. Bloomberg did not return emails and calls asking for comment. As adoption of AI tools in hiring expands, lawmakers are starting to take a closer look. In the UK, the government is planning new regulation of algorithmic decision making. In the US, a recent local law requires employers to inform job seekers how their application materials are screened by AI upon request. And congressional lawmakers have introduced bills that would regulate AI in hiring at a national level, including the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2022, but have faced hurdles getting them passed. Burch decided to file an official claim with the Information Commissioner's Office, an independent organization that upholds privacy laws in the UK. In February the office reprimanded Bloomberg, writing: 'From reviewing the information provided, it is our decision that there is more work for you to do. As such, we now expect you to take steps to address any outstanding issues with the individual.' Burch has since accepted PS8,000 ($9,864) in compensation from the company. He says he also fought to demonstrate a point: 'I am trying to prove to them that it's probably weeding out good candidates so they should probably stop using it.' Plum's CEO Caitlin MacGregor declined to comment on Burch's case directly, citing privacy concerns, but she stands behind her product: 'I should not be interviewing somebody that is a 35, regardless of how much experience they have. There is somewhere else that they are going to be their own 95 [percent] match.'", "450263a2bfd0d7417223868ee7c8392875ab1617e26ddb2651231795": "California officials are poised to decide the fate of a controversial desalination plant planned along its southern coast, in a vote that comes as the American west battles an increasingly perilous drought. California water use leapt 19% in March, amid one of the driest months on record. After more than a decade of debate, the California coastal commission on Thursday will finally vote on a proposal for a $1.4bn desalination plant in Huntington Beach, south of Los Angeles. As the west grows hotter and drier, the state and others in its neighborhood are seeing water supplies grow scarce. California is now facing its third consecutive year of crippling drought, with shortages spurring strict restrictions. Rising heat also means more water is needed to sustain people, ecosystems and the state's thirsty agricultural sector. Desalination plants, which convert seawater into potable water, have long been considered a possible solution, as residents, developers and policymakers look to capture the water crashing against the California shores. The Huntington Beach plant has prominent backers, including the state's governor, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Chamber of Commerce and a slew of other state and local officials. But experts say siphoning water from the sea isn't a simple answer to a complex and burgeoning crisis. Desalination plants require large amounts of energy to turn salt water into fresh water and have a significant impact on marine life. Critics of the Huntington Beach project have also argued that for all its costs, the plant wouldn't actually make water more accessible or affordable to the Californians who need it most. 'Desalination is intuitively appealing to the person on the street or your average policymaker,' said Dr Gregory Pierce, director of the human right to water solutions lab at University of California, Los Angeles. 'But in this case, it is going to make the water rich, richer.' If approved, the Huntington Beach plant would be California's 13th, and one of the largest in the nation. The facility proposed by the project development company Poseidon Water would pump in roughly 106m gallons (401m litres) of seawater each day, converting it to roughly 50m gallons of potable water. What's leftover - a thick salty brine - would be released back in the ocean. If approved, the construction on the plant is scheduled for as early as 2023 and it can be up and running three years later. Poseidon says the project will have an impact on declining water levels across the state, though the water will only be supplied locally in Orange county. '[The region] will not be pulling water from the Colorado River or northern California, which means that communities to the east of us and the north of us will be able to benefit from this project,' said Jessica Jones, a spokesperson for the company.  'It really impacts the entire west. With the drought situation we are in, and that we will continue to face for years and years, it is so important that we look to new supplies,' she said. Along with a new source of water, proponents of the project claim it will be a financial boon to the region, bringing in billions in revenue to Orange county and thousands of jobs. The company has committed to purchasing carbon offsets and investing in efforts like reforestation credits to counteract energy use, which Jones says will also be supplied by renewables. Skeptics, however, have questioned the company's commitment - and ability - to mitigate the environmental impact from the project expected by experts. Along with seawater, desalination plants suck small creatures into the system. Although the company will utilize screens with 1 millimeter mesh to limit the impact on animals, scientists at the Coastal Commission reviewing the proposal estimate the plant would still kill creatures such as fish larvae and plankton, 'resulting in substantial losses of marine ecosystem productivity'. Critics have also raised concerns over the plant's location. Concentrated in an area of industrial development, the facility would be situated on a partially remediated Superfund site, near a wastewater treatment plant, a former oil tank farm, and what was once a dump. Construction could spread contaminants from those sources into nearby disadvantaged communities, carried east by the coastal winds, critics warned. Beyond these concerns, some researchers have cautioned that the project would not benefit those most affected by California's water woes. Pierce, the UCLA professor, and a team of researchers studied the proposal in 2019. They concluded that the plant is located in an area of the state that's not hurting for high-quality, reliable water, but the project would make drinking water less affordable for disadvantaged households in Orange county. 'Proponents have vaguely asserted that there will be equity benefits from this plant but haven't provided any evidence of what that means,' he added. Instead, according to his team's research, the large cost of the project would raise overall water prices in the region, hurting those who already struggle the most to pay their water bill. Jones, the Poseidon spokesperson, said that while the project may push water rates higher, a local fixed rate could become more affordable than other sources in the dry decades to come. California's coastal commission, however, estimates that the cost of the project for low-income Orange county residents would be significant. Water rate hikes would 'disproportionately impact millions of low-income residents throughout Orange county water district's service area, the majority of which are people of color', the commission wrote in its report. 'We already know that this thing is not going to make water cheaper and it is not even reliable,' said Andrea Leon-Grossmann, director of climate action at Azul, a grassroots organization that works with Latino communities to protect the coast from industrialization, noting that previous plants produced less water than promised and can be compromised by oil spills, red tides and natural disasters. As part of the coalition against Poseidon, Azul and others submitted a 153-page report outlining issues to the coastal commission. Along with higher costs, Leon-Grossmann said her organization was concerned about plant emissions adding pollution to areas already facing stark disparities; increased dead zones, or areas in the ocean where plants and animals are unable to survive and perish in high numbers; and the threats from sea level rise, tsunamis and earthquakes, all of which could put the plant - and those who live near it - in greater jeopardy. California's governor, Gavin Newsom, has urged the commission to greenlight the project despite the criticism, arguing the drought emergency requires urgent answers. 'This administration is committed to ensuring the sustainability of California's water supply with an all-of-the above strategy, and that includes desalination,' a spokesperson for the governor said in a statement. 'The governor has supported this project for years and made clear that not approving this project would be a setback, while also encouraging accountability and environmental justice measures. Regions across California must continue to innovate on local projects as climate change makes our state's water supply more unpredictable.' Last month, Newsom was even more direct when talking about the desalination project with the Bay Area News Group editorial board, calling a vote against it a 'big mistake'. 'We need more tools in the damn tool kit,' he said, adding: 'Be tough. Be fair though. Don't be ideological.' Pierce argued he would 'make a big distinction between this particular plant and every desalination conversation elsewhere in California'. 'This is a backup supply for those who want to keep using water the ways we have used water,' he said. He argued that Orange county residents would benefit more from increased investments in recycling and stormwater to groundwater recapture than from the plant. Leon-Grossmann, too, said there are still plenty of other options on the table. 'We are still flushing toilets with drinking water,' she said, adding that building codes and retrofitting could make homes and businesses more water efficient. 'Just plugging the leaks could create more water than the desal plant can create.' Desalination shouldn't be seen as the simple solution, but rather the last resort, she argued. 'It is just not necessary,' Leon-Grossmann said. 'We are not saying never - we are just saying not right now.'", "0ab659d0830ebfb0ae7f5969e0999c277b446e8d78e9f0a4788cda5a": "After the bombshell leak of a supreme court draft opinion last week revealed that the majority of justices plan to overturn Roe v Wade, a handful of states have been reaffirming and expanding their abortion care. In recent days, a flurry of bills and statements have been emerging in largely Democratic-run states as lawmakers and organizations scramble to prepare for the possibility of a post-Roe America. As some states seek to become 'safe havens' for out-of-state abortion seekers, other states have been increasing abortion funding, expanding provider access and offering legal protections from lawsuits launched by citizen 'bounty-hunters' against those involved in abortions. Only 38% of women of reproductive age live in states that have shown support for abortion rights, according to the research organization Guttmacher Institute. In contrast, 58% live in states that have demonstrated hostility towards abortion rights. Only 4% of women live in middle-ground states. Last month, the New York state senator Liz Krueger introduced a bill that would shield New York doctors who offer abortion services to out-of-state patients by prohibiting law enforcement from cooperating with out-of-state investigations on abortion provisions. 'At this critical moment New York must ensure abortion access both to New Yorkers and refugees from other states who are being denied their basic rights,' Krueger told the Guardian. 'We must provide iron-clad protection for New York healthcare providers against abhorrent and regressive laws in other states,' she added. Similarly, Alessandra Biaggi, another New York state senator, introduced a bill that would create an abortion access fund and allow taxpayers to contribute to it. 'We created this bill to make sure that we were not just saying that people have a right to an abortion, but also that they have access to it because we know that simply by just saying the right does not mean that people have the means to do it,' Biaggi told the Guardian. In addition to transportation costs, the fund would cover childcare services, lodging, various medical expenses and other logistical support. Biaggi also introduced another bill that would offer out-of-state women who seek abortion or gender-affirming services the claim of 'unlawful interference' with their rights if they end up facing criminal or civil complaints. In Connecticut, Governor Ned Lamont signed a bill into law that will protect people who provide or receive abortion services in Connecticut and are then sued in another state. The first-in-the-nation law, which is set to take effect on 1 July, will also improve abortion access in Connecticut by expanding the type of practitioners eligible to perform certain abortion-related care. 'We want to make sure that we have the healthcare infrastructure to provide for not only our own residents, but also the folks who are going to be coming here for care,' state representative Matt Blumenthal, who co-sponsored the bill, said. As Connecticut is poised to become one of the country's few safe havens, lawmakers like Blumenthal are well aware of the challenges that will come with an uptick in out-of-state abortion seekers. 'A possible influx in out-of-state patients ... is definitely a concern. We've already seen individuals coming from Texas to get abortion care here in Connecticut and that was one of the reasons we wanted to expand the providers eligible to give the care,' he said. Blumenthal added, 'We got important sources of funding in our budget this year to protect reproductive healthcare in the state and that's very important because you know the people who are going to be affected by these bans in other states are going to be disproportionately people of low income, people of color who can't afford to travel freely.' Another state that has been weaving additional abortion care funds into its laws is Oregon. In February, the state legislature established the Reproductive Health Equity Fund which will allocate $15m to the non-profit Seeding Justice for expanded abortion access. Seeding Justice has described the fund, which will help Oregon brace for the abortion ban in neighboring Idaho, as a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest in abortion access as a central part of Oregon's healthcare infrastructure'. 'These funds are meant to be holistic ...Those funds are really focused on patients get[ting] care and extending provider capacity,' An Do, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon, said. Do continued, 'Within Oregon, we know that we need to be ramping up our healthcare infrastructure ... and shrinking the access desert ... so I think that is a big place to be able to make investments.' California has similarly positioned itself as 'a refuge state' of abortion rights. In January, the state legislature introduced a package of 13 bills to designate California as a sanctuary for abortion care. In addition to offering more legal protection to out-of-state patients and providers' privacy, the bills seek to expand the number of providers that are able to perform abortion services. One bill seeks to remove co-pays, deductibles and other cost-sharing requirements for abortions for all state-licensed health care service plans that are issued after 2022. Another bill would deny out-of-state subpoenas for patient information on reproductive health services that are granted in California. Other bills seek to protect California abortion providers by prohibiting the removal or suspension of medical licenses for a California licensee providing abortion care who is complying with state law. In Colorado, lawmakers are also rushing to codify abortion access protections. Colorado is one of the few states that does not require a 72-hour waiting period after abortion counseling. It also does not have any restrictions surrounding when in a pregnancy an abortion can take place. In April, Colorado's governor, Jared Polis, signed the Reproductive Health Equity Act, officially encoding the right to abortion into state law. According to the Colorado health department, 13% of the 10,400 abortion seekers who had the procedure in Colorado in 2020 were from out of state. As at least three of Colorado's immediate neighbors are certain or likely to ban abortion if Roe v Wade gets overturned, the state is preparing for an uptick in out-of-state abortion seekers, which may push Colorado residents further way to seek care. Greer Donley, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in reproductive healthcare, told the Guardian, 'People will feel the effects of Roe being overturned, even if their state continues to allow abortion provision.' 'The primary way they will see these effects is through the wait times ... If half the states ban all or most abortions within the next few months, then the clinics in blue states will be inundated with patients traveling from out of state,' she said. As a result, Colorado clinics have vowed to do everything they can in order to expand access to abortion providers as they struggle with worker shortages, lengthy wait times and post-abortion complications. 'Capacity is critical. We know that clinics in access states are scheduling patients in weeks rather than days and they have added more exam rooms by consolidating offices and waiting areas. And opening new facilities is difficult, as is finding staff, since we are in a healthcare worker shortage,' said Elizabeth Nash, Guttmacher Institute's state policy expert. 'For patients, helping them pay for the abortion and abortion-related travel is key,' she added. In Maryland, lawmakers passed a bill last month that allows medical professionals other than physicians to perform abortions. The law will allow nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and trained physician assistants to carry out the procedure. In addition, the law will require the state to invest $3.5m annually in abortion-care training and will require the majority of insurance providers in the state to cover abortion costs. Last month, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan filed a lawsuit in a state court that seeks to strike down the state's 1931 law that criminalizes abortions unless they are performed to protect a woman's life. The lawsuit also seeks to establish the right to an abortion in the state's constitution. Despite the various steps that progressive states have taken to expand abortion access, some still have certain restrictions in place that need to be removed to ensure abortion care is fully accessible. In addition to capacity problems, another significant restriction is costs. 'States need to look at how they help people pay for abortions, as we know that most patients pay out-of-pocket for their abortion,' Nash said. With at least 26 states poised to, likely or certain to ban abortions if Roe v Wade is overturned, the fight for abortion rights is more urgent than ever. 'I can't underscore how seismic a change this is,' said An Do. 'We never lost a constitutional right. This is just the beginning ... They [the justices] have written us all out of the constitution. What's next is marriage equality, what's next is so many people's access to birth control. 'We cannot be apathetic and we cannot lose ourselves into despair. We need to fight tooth and nail.'", "eac704331f379c193a86cba08db07cdf5f366c24b4aac3201083e1d7": "Sinthia Vee is not sure where her art supplies went. 'That's a big old question mark,' she said, sitting outside Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan's East Village neighborhood, on a recent sunny afternoon. It will rain soon. Vee said she was sitting in solidarity with others from New York's homeless community who - like her - had just had their encampments removed. A painter at heart whose only idea of her age is 'old enough to remember a lot of things from the 80s', Vee was now worrying about the medicine bags and art supplies she had kept in her tent that were now missing. 'I lost a bunch of things that day because it was insane and we moved around a lot.' She feared the medicine bag, like many other belongings of homeless people the city is trying to remove, were thrown in a compactor. This haze - of where things went, where things go - has become a common experience for those trying to survive the string of removal of homeless encampments across the city under its new Democratic mayor, Eric Adams. Adams is building up to keeping promises he made on the campaign trail on addressing the problem of homelessness by building more shelters. In recent years, New York City has seen a surge in homelessness: in February alone, there were nearly 50,000 people in the homeless shelters, whereas the total number of homeless people in shelters was only a little over double that number in all of 2021. During his campaign, Adams said that he would pair up police with mental health service providers to address homelessness, and that there is 'nothing dignified about sleeping on the streets'. But homeless advocates have slammed Adams's tactics as simply retreading old policies that have failed to meaningfully address the underlying problems causing homelessness and are, in fact, more geared to generating sympathetic headlines in the city's media. Johnny Grima, who has been on the streets since he was a teenager, has been on the frontlines of protests against the city's strict moves against homeless people since Adams became mayor in January. He said while every administration has controversial measures against homelessness, it's Adams's 'toxic' rhetoric on the issue that makes him stand out. 'I think fascism works like that - as soon as there's a tightening of the belt or any sort of shift into harder times, that fascist and oppressive elements within countries will immediately try to attack the most vulnerable,' he said. For the homeless, it's not just a loss of their homes but also a loss of their place of belonging and safety. Grima is among those who have been brutalized in his efforts to stop being removed. The first time he was arrested, the officials came and told him and his friends they could sleep there but would have to remove their tents. 'They ended up coming to the conclusion that we could sleep in the cold and wet so long as we didn't cover ourselves, [and] that we couldn't have a tent to protect ourselves from the elements,' he added. In late April, he would be arrested again, for the third time, for trying to hold down his tent during a raid. 'They threw me on my head,' he said. He was made to wear an ankle shackle at the hospital, and was cuffed to his bed for hours before he was taken to jail, where he stayed for 12 hours. The mayor's office said they don't authorize any arrests, but the New York police department (NYPD) is part of the multi-agency taskforce that is participating in the sweeps. The NYPD acknowledged the arrests in a statement, claiming most people from the community have been 'cooperative' and a 'small number' of people were arrested. 'There have been instances where individuals who have taken over public spaces to create encampments have interfered with city employees carrying out the clearing operations,' the agency said. 'In those cases a small number of people have been taken into custody and issued summonses.' Peter Malvan, a homeless advocate at the Safety Net Project of the Urban Justice Center, said even though a lot of people had their belongings organized and cleaned, their belongings weren't spared from being thrown away. 'Somebody's encampment looks like somebody's living room,' he said. 'All of that was trashed.' Mike Rodriguez, whose encampment was removed during the initial round from under the BQE bridge in Brooklyn, said he had already sorted out his and his partner's belongings when he got the notice. Their belongings, at least what they chose to hold on to, didn't get thrown out by the authorities. But it stings Rodriguez nonetheless, because there were things he and his partner, Parker Wolf, wanted to keep but had to throw out, including winter hats, sweaters and sneakers. They held on to their power outlets, cereal, peanut butter and jelly and some clothes. The mayor's office said because each encampment is given prior notice, the authorities remove the belongings when they arrive there and the location hasn't been cleared. For those whose belongings are thrown away, like Grima and Ver, the only option is to call 311 to report it. 'You just have to rebuild right away, and try to keep on living,' Grima said. Two days after Grima's arrest, the mayor's office announced a $171m addition to the budget to add more shelters and beds. But many advocates say Adams's focus on shelters as a solution doesn't make a difference for the community because shelters aren't an answer for them. As of 29 March, within 12 days of starting the crackdowns, city officials had visited 244 locations, and cleared 239 locations. Only five people accepted offers to move to a shelter. This is because most homeless people don't consider the shelters safe and some say the staff themselves can be hostile and abusive. 'The staff can say whatever they want - they call you names, belittle, threaten,' Grima said. 'They do this to senior citizens and disabled people.' Malvan echoed these experiences. He said people are 'passed around' from one shelter to another for 'advocating for themselves', and have been beaten by security. The mayor's office, in response to queries about the alleged abuse, said they are 'committed to prioritizing the safety of clients, staff and community members alike'. The homeless population was also particularly vulnerable during the pandemic, and putting them in shelters during this time, which the CDC recommended against, put them more at risk - as well as the public, Malvan said. At the shelters, people were made to live with about 20 others in a room, only two feet apart, he added. They were made to leave the shelters between 9am and 4pm, so they spent their days in public. 'It's like they actually created a situation where the pandemic could spread more and it affected everyone,' he said. New York City's homeless population outside shelters were significantly less affected by the pandemic than those in shelters during the first year of the pandemic. The population in shelters had 12 times the confirmed cases of Covid compared with those outside the shelters, and 17 times more deaths. The Black homeless community had the highest number of cases both in and out of shelters. Vee, Gima, Rodriguez and Wolf came from different generations and different parts of the country but they arrived at the same crossroad of a homeless policy that has upended their vulnerable lives. They all have different aspirations. Vee hopes to someday have her own art exhibition. Gima wants to have a #Me Too moment for the shelters that will expose their conditions. 'Hopefully we fight from the streets because it's not going to come from the top,' he said. Rodriguez and Wolf spend their days scrapping metals to earn a living and buy their food, while looking for a job. As it began pouring on a cloudy April afternoon, they stood protected under the BQE bridge and surrounded by piles of discarded items - cardboard boxes, a broken stroller, shopping carts and a solitary milk carton. Rodriguez looked around, getting ready to work. He'd have to start clearing the items under the bridge. 'After all,' he gestured towards one of the high-rises towering over the bridge, and shrugged, 'those guys pay $3,000 per month for the view, right?'", "e5616e7dff28bd981a7dbfe204e81f47ab58cd71711bf75d58ee1320": "", "fe5395eeaba0904b9ee4e9adf7f2b7b909f9b0c80312445767cdefac": "", "4e0d6aeb5b496e612391f2d642bdfc3575cf9a643ca7af0891a04a9d": "", "cf982e217a16074a9164438d0229aeeb2c565a0c644de10873c3b55a": "Ukraine has said it will suspend the flow of gas through a transit point that it says delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine, blaming Moscow for the move and saying it would move the flows elsewhere.

GTSOU, which operates Ukraine's gas system, said it would stop shipments via the Sokhranivka route from Wednesday, declaring 'force majeure', a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control, Reuters reports. But Gazprom, which has a monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline, said it was 'technologically impossible' to shift all volumes to the Sudzha interconnection point further west, as GTSOU proposed. GTSOU CEO Sergiy Makogon told Reuters that Russian occupying forces had started taking gas transiting through Ukraine and sending it to two Russia-backed separatist regions in the country's east. He did not cite evidence. The company said it could not operate at the Novopskov gas compressor station due to 'the interference of the occupying forces in technical processes', adding it could temporarily shift the affected flow to the Sudzha physical interconnection point located in territory controlled by Ukraine. Ukraine's suspension of Russian natural gas flows through the Sokhranivka route should not have an impact on the domestic Ukrainian market, state energy firm Naftogaz head Yuriy Vitrenko told Reuters. The state gas company in Moldova, a small nation on Ukraine's western border, said it had not received any notice from GTSOU or Gazprom that supplies would be interrupted. Ukraine's state emergency services have updated the figure for the number of explosives and munitions they have dealt with. They posted to their Telegram channel that since Russia's latest invasion began on 24 February, they have dealt with a total of 102,676 explosive devices, including 1,967 aircraft bombs. The claim has not been independently verified. Russia's news agency RIA is carrying quotes from Apta Alaudinov, assistant to the head of Chechnya, claiming that the remnants of the Ukrainian troops driven out of the city of Rubizhne in the Donbas are blocked at the Zarya plant. It quotes him saying: Rubizhne is in the Luhansk region to the east of Ukraine. Zarya is a chemical plant. A series of photos published on the Azov Regiment's Telegram channel early this morning purport to show the squalid conditions of wounded Ukrainian defenders holed up under the Azovstal steelworks plant in besieged Mariupol. The harrowing images reveal the horror of a dimly lit, makeshift 'hospital' inside the plant where soldiers receive treatment, many for lost limbs. The photos were published alongside a statement pleading for help. The regiment pleaded for the 'immediate evacuation of wounded servicemen to Ukrainian-controlled territories' where they could be assisted and provided with proper care. The US House of Representatives has approved more than $40bn in aid for Ukraine. The House passed the Ukraine spending bill by 368 to 57 on Tuesday evening, with every 'no' vote coming from Republicans, according to a Reuters report. The measure now heads to the Senate, which is expected to act quickly. President Joe Biden had asked Congress to approve an additional $33bn in aid for Ukraine two weeks ago, but lawmakers decided to increase the military and humanitarian funding. 'This bill will protect democracy, limit Russian aggression, and strengthen our own national security, while, most importantly, supporting Ukraine,' Democratic representative Rosa DeLauro, who chairs the House appropriations committee, said. Some Republicans opposed the bill, criticising Democrats for moving too quickly to send too many US taxpayer dollars abroad. Biden's fellow Democrats narrowly control Congress, but the bill will need Republican votes to get through the Senate. The package includes $6bn for security assistance, including training, equipment, weapons and support; $8.7bn to replenish stocks of US equipment sent to Ukraine, and $3.9bn for European Command operations. In addition, the legislation authorises a further $11bn in Presidential Drawdown Authority, which allows the president to authorise the transfer of articles and services from US stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency. Biden had asked for $5bn. It also authorises $4bn in foreign military financing to provide support for Ukraine and other countries affected by the crisis.

Russia could dominate the north-western Black Sea if it is able to consolidates its position on Snake Island, according to the the UK ministry of defence. The report, released just after 6am this morning, reads:  In case you missed this slightly uplifting news from earlier, Ukraine has been voted through to the grand final in the Eurovision Song Contest. At the end of their semi-final performance, the folk-rap group Kalush Orchestra thanked everyone for supporting their country amid the Russian invasion. The group had been unable to meet and rehearse regularly and were only able to get together about six weeks before Tuesday night's performance. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills, who was commentating for the BBC coverage of the semi-final, said: 'Frontman Oleg joked that he doesn't think the lack of rehearsal time will affect their performance because they're very attractive men.' The Ukrainian act is the favourite to win. The competition's producers previously announced Russia will no longer participate in this year's contest following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine earlier announced its forces have recaptured villages from Russian troops north and north-east of Kharkiv, pressing a counter-offensive that could signal a shift in the war's momentum and jeopardise Russia's main advance. Tetiana Apatchenko, press officer for the 92nd Separate Mechanised Brigade, the main Ukrainian force in the area, in the country's east, confirmed that Ukrainian troops had in recent days recaptured the settlements of Cherkaski Tyshky, Ruski Tyshki, Borshchova and Slobozhanske, in a pocket north of Kharkiv. Defence ministry adviser Yuriy Saks said the successes were pushing Russian forces out of range of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city and located in the north-east, which has been under perpetual bombardment since the war began. Ukraine's president Zelenskiy also confirmed the news during his national address, though he cautioned against expecting 'certain victories'. The counterattack near Kharkiv could signal a new phase, with Ukraine now going on the offensive after weeks in which Russia mounted a massive assault without making a breakthrough. By pushing back Russian forces who had occupied the outskirts of Kharkiv since the start of the invasion, the Ukrainians are moving into striking distance of the rear supply lines sustaining the main Russian attack force further south. Neil Melvin of the RUSI think tank in London said: Hello and welcome back to the Guardian's live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I'm Samantha Lock and I'll be bringing you all the latest developments until my colleague Martin Belam in London takes the reins a little later. It is just after 8am in Ukraine.

With the war now in its 11th week and Russia pounding the vital port of Odesa with missile strikes in an apparent effort to disrupt supply lines, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Tuesday that the military was gradually pushing Russian troops away from the key city of Kharkiv and back towards the border with Russia. The Ukrainian military's general staff said its forces drove the Russians out of four villages to the north-east of Kharkiv, a key city that has been under attack from the Russians since the beginning of the conflict. Tetiana Apatchenko, press officer for the 92nd separate mechanised brigade, the main Ukrainian force in the area, confirmed that Ukrainian troops had in recent days recaptured the settlements of Cherkaski Tyshky, Ruski Tyshki, Borshchova and Slobozhanske, in a pocket north of Kharkiv. Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba seemed to indicate that the country could go beyond merely pushing Russia back to areas it or its allies held on the day of the 24 February invasion. The idea reflected Ukraine's ability to stymie a larger, better-armed Russian military, which has surprised many who had anticipated a much quicker end to the conflict. Kuleba told the Financial Times that Ukraine initially believed victory would be the withdrawal of Russian troops to positions they occupied before the invasion. 'Now if we are strong enough on the military front, and we win the battle for Donbas, which will be crucial for the following dynamics of the war, of course the victory for us in this war will be the liberation of the rest of our territories.' In another possible sign of increasing Ukrainian confidence, GTSOU, which operates Ukraine's gas system, said it would stop shipments via Sokhranivka from Wednesday, a transit point that it says delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine. It declared 'force majeure', a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control, Reuters reported. Russia's Gazprom said this would be 'technologically impossible'. However, Russia continues to bombard many parts of Ukraine as the conflict becomes increasingly attritional. Ukraine said on Tuesday that Russian forces fired seven missiles at Odesa a day earlier, hitting a shopping centre and a warehouse in the country's largest port. One person was killed and five wounded, the military said. Images showed a burning building and debris - including a tennis shoe - in a heap of destruction in the city on the Black Sea. Mayor Gennady Trukhanov later visited the warehouse and said it 'had nothing in common with military infrastructure or military objects.' One of the most dramatic examples of Ukraine's ability to prevent easy victories is in Mariupol, where Ukrainian fighters remained holed up at a steel plant, denying Russia's full control of the city. The regiment defending the plant said Russian warplanes continued bombarding it, striking 34 times in 24 hours. In recent days, the United Nations and the Red Cross organised a rescue of what some officials said were the last civilians trapped at the plant. But two officials said Tuesday that about 100 were believed to still be in the complex's underground tunnels. Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said those who remain are people 'that the Russians have not selected' for evacuation. Kyrylenko and Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, did not say how they knew civilians were still in the complex - a warren of tunnels and bunkers spread over 11 square kilometers (4 square miles). Others said their statements were impossible to confirm. Other key developments included:", "c97e47de0b6d840b229957f11d4c4ba256d0e6208bf94f4e77d45c0c": "Vladimir Putin could view the prospect of defeat in Ukraine as an existential threat to his regime, potentially triggering his resort to using a nuclear weapon, the top US intelligence official has warned. The warning on Tuesday came in an assessment from intelligence chiefs briefing the Senate on worldwide threats. The prediction for Ukraine was a long, gruelling war of attrition, which could lead to increasingly volatile acts of escalation from Putin, including full mobilisation, the imposition of martial law, and - if the Russian leader felt the war was going against him, endangering his position in Moscow - even the use of a nuclear warhead. The grim forecast came on a day of continued fighting in the east and south of Ukraine, and Russian missile attacks on the port of Odesa, with the UN conceding that the civilian death toll from the war will probably be far higher than the current official estimate of 3,381. The director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, told the Senate armed services committee that Putin would continue to brandish Russia's nuclear arsenal in an attempt to deter the US and its allies from further support for Ukraine. The shift of focus to the east and the south are most likely a temporary tactic rather than a permanent scaling back of war aims, she said. The Russian leader would not use a nuclear weapon until he saw an existential threat to Russia or his regime, Haines argued. But she added that he could view the prospect of defeat in Ukraine as constituting such a threat. 'We do think that [Putin's perception of an existential threat] could be the case in the event that he perceives that he is losing the war in Ukraine, and that Nato in effect is either intervening or about to intervene in that context, which would obviously contribute to a perception that he is about to lose the war in Ukraine,' Haines told the committee hearing. She added that the world would probably have some warning that nuclear use was imminent. 'There are a lot of things that he would do in the context of escalation before he would get to nuclear weapons, and also that he would be likely to engage in some signaling beyond what he's done thus far before doing so,' Haines said. That signaling could include a further large-scale nuclear exercise involving the substantial dispersal of mobile intercontinental missiles, heavy bombers and strategic submarines. The assessment the US intelligence chiefs laid out for the senators suggested that Ukraine was faced with the prospect of a war of attrition. They said Putin intended to conquer the Luhansk and Donetsk regions plus a buffer zone around them, to secure a land bridge to Crimea. He wanted to hold Kherson, north of Crimea, to secure the water supply to the peninsula. However, his ambitions did not stop there. Haines said there were 'indications' that Putin wants to extend the land bridge as far as Transnistria, the Moscow-occupied region of Moldova, thereby controlling all of Ukraine's Black Sea coast. Haines said, however, that Putin would face an uphill task, and that the extension of the land bridge to Transnistria, including the capture of Odesa, would not be possible without a full mobilisation. She added that the capture of the Donbas plus a buffer zone was unlikely in the next few weeks. The head of the Defence Intelligence Agency, Lt Gen Scott Berrier, said that the US believed that between eight and 10 Russian generals had been killed so far in the conflict. Like Haines, Berrier predicted a stalemate, with neither side able to achieve a breakthrough. But a decision by Putin to order a full mobilisation in Russia, ushered in by a formal declaration of war, could change the military balance. 'If they do mobilise, and they do declare war, that'll bring thousands more soldiers to the fight,' Berrier said. 'And even though they may not be as well trained and competent, they will still bring mass and a lot more ammunition.' Despite all the setbacks, Haines said Putin was probably convinced that Russia ultimately had more stamina than Ukraine and its backers. 'He is probably counting on the US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse,' she said. Given Putin's conviction he could ultimately prevail, and the fact that Ukraine showed no signs of giving in, Haines said US intelligence agencies 'do not see a viable negotiating path forward, at least in the short term'. Meanwhile, as the war of attrition continued, the conflict was likely to take 'a more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory'. 'The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means, including imposing martial law, reorienting industrial production, or potentially escalatory military actions to free up the resources needed to achieve his objectives as the conflict drags on, or if he perceives Russia is losing in Ukraine,' Haines said. The most likely flashpoint in the coming weeks, she added, would be escalating Russian attempts to intimidate the west to stop weapons supplies into Ukraine and possible retaliation for western economic sanctions or perceived threats to Putin's regime at home.", "59e64f261d674e8f34809b7ed56d8147f4647aaf5f8c7d77b6df7365": "", "f11ec1a5584af3a6cb03274d011e1b9ce8a06034d25a968b5f139eb4": "The longer the war in Ukraine carries on, the worse the consequences will be for the climate, the US presidential envoy John Kerry has warned. Many countries are struggling with an energy crisis while also urgently needing to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global heating to 1.5C, he said. 'If it's a long period of time, obviously that makes [staying within 1.5C] very complicated,' Kerry said. 'It depends on what happens with the war, where the war goes and how long it lasts. If miraculously we can somehow find a way to resolve some of the fundamental problems in the next six months, then maybe we could just accelerate everything together. I think we can make up some distance [in progress on tackling the climate crisis].' But he added: 'The longer this goes on, the harder it becomes [to stay within 1.5C]. There are a number of scientists who believe we are on the edge of 1.5C now. Anything that is not part of the acceleration [of emissions-cutting efforts] gets in the way.' He said the agreement reached at the UN Cop26 climate summit last year would have 'faced some big hurdles' if taking place in the current geopolitical circumstances, but there was still a chance of fulfilling its promises. 'This is not easy, but it hasn't fallen apart,' he told the Guardian. '[The effort to stay within 1.5C] has met with an unexpected barrier, the war, and it has met with an unfortunate and dangerous resurgence of business as usual by some parties that threatens the acceleration necessary to get the job done, and it's going to be up to us to push back and continue with the process.' The world's leading climate scientists recently warned it was 'now or never' for the world to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis. Kerry said this showed there was still a chance of holding to the 1.5C goal. 'The IPCC said to us a few weeks ago 'we're behind, it's not getting better at the pace it should be, emissions have gone up, but you still have time to do this',' he said. 'And my message to people is we have to take advantage of the fact that the science tells us we still have time, but we have to greatly accelerate what we're doing. We have to speed up very significantly.' He said the disruption caused by the Ukraine war was forcing countries to reconsider their dependence on fossil fuels. 'The promises of Cop26 were never going to be fulfilled in six months, or one year or two years. These are promises for 2030. A hiccup of a number of months may be something that we can work around or get through.' Kerry also said the US would increase its production of natural gas, despite its climate targets, to help allies replace Russian fossil fuels. He said gas from the US produced lower carbon emissions than gas from Russia, owing to more efficient extraction, and could provide a short-term solution while countries ramp up renewable energy. The US president, Joe Biden, has come under heavy criticism from green campaigners in the US for allowing the expansion of gas drilling, opening up new tracts of public land for exploration and development. Kerry said more gas was needed in the short term, to make up for supplies lost from Russia, but that companies should beware of building large amounts of new gas infrastructure that would be left as stranded assets when the energy crisis passes. 'Gas has always been part of the transition away from dirtier fossil fuels and towards this new energy economy,' he said. 'I'd take a gas-fired power plant in the near term - I emphasise near term - over coal or oil any day of the week. But we don't want to build out a huge new infrastructure around gas that has stranded asset challenges or is unabated [not fitted with technology to capture and store carbon] after a number of years.' He hinted at moves to limit how long such plants could operate. 'We have to decide how quickly we must have a requisite for abatement - maybe 10 years, eight years, who knows? But for the long run, gas is going to have to abate and live up to low emissions standards just like everybody else,' he said. With six months to go before the next UN climate summit, Cop27 in Egypt, Kerry said the focus must be on the G20 countries, the world's 20 biggest economies, which are responsible for about 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The emissions-cutting plans these countries brought to Cop26 were inadequate to meet the 1.5C target, so they have been asked to come to Egypt this November with more stringent proposals. Kerry acknowledged that many countries were unlikely to meet the targets, including Russia, which is one of the biggest fossil fuel producers. He warned some countries were 'indifferent' to the need to cut emissions, or have vested interests in not doing so. 'The war is not the only thing that's in the way of the acceleration - an unfortunate indifference in some quarters, outright disinformation in others, and people who just love the status quo is perhaps one of our biggest problems,' he said. But there were hopes that major emitters including China and India were embracing change, he added. 'We're prepared to try to help China or provide whatever China is willing to accept in terms of assistance.' He also pointed to India, currently suffering a massive heatwave, where a large expansion of renewable energy is planned that could enable the country to cut emissions in line with a global 1.5C temperature goal. Kerry said he was hopeful that the climate legislation currently stuck in Congress, largely because of the refusal of a single Democratic senator to pass it, would soon be resolved. He said other countries were unlikely to be discouraged from taking action themselves by the US's own internal difficulties. 'Maybe they'll say 'screw them, they can't get their act together, we're going to do it',' he said. 'I can't predict, but I can tell you this: that President Biden is committed to moving forward and obviously he has administrative powers and can issue certain executive orders and do certain things. 'Even while Donald Trump was president, pulled out of Paris, 75% of the new power that came online in the US was renewable. So the truth is that a lot of what happens in the US will be governed locally and some nationally by governors of states and mayors of cities who are deeply committed.'", "26add2cb6bbef802a3a21b2d131e9481ae3b3f62bc34b16149dcee22": "The bitter feud would almost be comical were it not being waged in the devastated Ukrainian town of Borodyanka, north of Kyiv, among hollowed out buildings, burned armoured vehicles and freshly dug graves. A near two-decade grudge between two priests, fuelled by fierce interchurch tensions and the pursuit of local dominance, has escalated into tit-for-tat claims of attempted murder, treachery, collaboration in forced deportations and vigilante vandalism. An uncomfortable introduction as younger men 18 years ago and a few awkward moments at local community events have spiralled, local people say, into each threatening God's judgment on the other. The chief accuser of the two is Father Dmytro Koshka, rector at the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, of the Orthodox church of Ukraine. It is not to be confused with the Moscow-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox church, for which the accused, Father Viktor Talko, is an archpriest. Koshka, 42, sitting in the shade of his church's porch as a line of local people waited to be handed spare clothes, food and water by volunteers, said he believed Talko, 67, at the Church of Archangel Michael, a short drive down Lesi Ukrainky boulevard, had directed Russian soldiers to hunt him down at the height of their occupation on 2 March. 'I received a call from the territorial defence fighters because I am also a member of the Borodyanka territorial defence,' Koshka said. 'They said they were asking me to leave my house because the Moscow father had received Russian soldiers and cooperated with them.' Koshka said he left the next day for the sake of his wife, Mariya, 41, and daughter, Angelina, 18, for Piskivka, a village 15 miles north-west of Borodyanka. 'The territorial defence told me that when Russian soldiers came to the church to look for me, they showed everyone all my personal data, even my passport data. They had all the information about me,' he said. 'I used to be a deputy of the city council. And this is access to public information about me. But Russian soldiers, they would never have found it themselves, they were helped by the Russian priest. He gave them all this information ... I know him very well.' Koshka, who did not offer any evidence for his claims, went on: 'He gave [the Russian soldiers] shelter in his church. He then stationed their military equipment on his farm. His own son helped to do it. After that, he prepared food for them, fed them, they spent the night there. In short, he met them as his close friends. Everyone knows about it and everyone has seen it.' The gravest crime, Koshka said, however, was that Talko allowed his church to be part of a 'trick' on people desperate to escape the shelling in the town. Local people received a text message from an anonymous number inviting them to meet at Talko's church to be evacuated - but they had not been told that their destination was Russia-allied Belarus, it is claimed. 'The SBU [Ukrainian secret services] is dealing with him because he helped to smuggle people to Belarus, more than 100 people,' Koshka said. 'They had tried to escape. He, his son, his family got into a minibus and started running. But one bridge was blown up, another bridge was blown up and in third place was the Ukrainian army. And they were trapped, they had nowhere to run.' Talko was, he added, not a priest but a 'wolf in sheep's clothing'. A five minute drive away, Talko, sitting among the cherry trees and blackberry bushes in the pretty grounds of his own church, angrily denied most of the claims and all of Koshka's interpretation of the events during the Russian occupation, calling his fellow priest 'spiritually ill' and saying he was seeking to stir up enmity. Talko said he was being unfairly accused of being an agent of the Russian army owing to the historical links between his denomination and Moscow, shaking his head as he spoke. He denied running away, saying he was picked up by the Ukrainian secret services on 2 April, the day after Russian forces left, and interrogated for six days in a gymnasium in Kyiv. Talko said he had only ever tried to help local people by asking for flour from the Russians and denied giving the invaders information about Koshka. 'I have no problems with the Ukrainian government,' said Talko, who has led his church in Borodyanka for 30 years. 'They accuse me of allegedly collaborating with the Russian occupation forces. Everything I did as a priest, as a clergyman. I turned to Russian soldiers only for help for Ukrainian civilians. 'I did not feed Russian soldiers either. We fed ordinary civilians. We asked for flour from Russian soldiers to bake bread for people in our church. And the Ukrainian authorities cannot understand how this is so - the enemy helped the Ukrainian priest. Ukrainian authorities now portray Russian soldiers as terrible. But in reality, the Russian soldiers here were different.' Grasping what he said was a letter of thanks from a Borodyanka family who had since moved and were uncontactable, Talko said people had been grateful for his help in getting them to Belarus. 'Please see what letters people wrote to me whom I helped to evacuate to Belarus,' he said. 'They are grateful to me for that. We helped evacuate our Ukrainian people through the Belarusian Red Cross. We asked for the Belarusian Red Cross and they evacuated people to Belarus. 'Our church helped evacuate 80 people to Belarus. And we also helped evacuate people to western Ukraine. We helped evacuate 1,500 people to western Ukraine.' Koshka's church had been formed merely to challenge his own, Talko said, adding that he believed Koshka had encouraged people to throw molotov cocktails into an outhouse by the gates to his church's estate. 'Here you see a burnt building near the church?' he asked. 'It was all organised by this priest. He is now a 'star and a patriot'. God bless him.' He added: 'The first time we met, he approached me with such a strange expression on his face. I told him - never get in my way again. If I was not a priest I would be talking to him differently now. I used to wrestle and do sports. Let God judge him.'", "60b9a1cc45fc8b79a8192f3b7a89d8dcd2690e7b28563fe79bb00555": "The lifting of zero-Covid policies in China would see a 'tsunami' of infections and almost 1.6 million deaths, a study claims, citing in part China's low vaccination rate of elderly residents. China's government remains committed to a zero-Covid policy, employing resource intensive mass testing and case surveillance, and enforcing lockdowns, strict quarantine and isolation. A speech last week by the president, Xi Jinping, reaffirmed the commitment, despite the challenge posed by the Omicron variant which has already overwhelmed other countries' zero-Covid policies. The peer reviewed study by Shanghai's Fudan University, published in the Nature journal, said a decision by Chinese authorities to lift such measures could see more than 112 million symptomatic cases of Covid-19, five million hospitalisations, and 1.55 million deaths. 'We find that the level of immunity induced by the March 2022 vaccination campaign would be insufficient to prevent an Omicron wave that would result in exceeding critical care capacity with a projected intensive care unit peak demand of 15.6 times the existing capacity,' the paper said. However it also said that with access to vaccines and antivirals and 'maintaining implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions', authorities could prevent the health system being overwhelmed. It suggested these factors could be more of a focus in future policies. While the government message is that the zero-Covid policy will prevail over the highly transmissible variant, health officials have said they cannot open up now because vaccine coverage is insufficient and health resources too uneven across the country. Health experts agree, but China analysts are also concerned the authorities have backed themselves into a corner with no political exit ramp for the policy without admitting failure. Case numbers are dropping in China but remain spread across multiple provinces. On Wednesday authorities reported 1,905 cases including 302 symptomatic. The bulk of cases are still being found in Shanghai, which has been under lockdown for more than two months. On Tuesday authorities announced new guidelines for people to home quarantine. Part of the change specified that among other requirements, the homes must have ventilation and drainage systems that 'won't contaminate those of other households', a report in the Global Times said. Other requirements include separate bathrooms and bedrooms, and the ability to care for oneself - in line with home isolation arrangements in other countries. However the prospect of allowing some asymptomatic people and close contacts to stay home has ignited debate among epidemiologists and health officials, and comes in stark contrast to the enforcement of measures on the ground, especially in Shanghai. Since Xi's speech last week, enforcement in the city appears to have hardened further. Social media is awash with videos of health workers and police officers in full protective equipment zealously enforcing regulations. There appears to be growing frustration with how the rules and regulations are being enforced, with many questioning how it compares to recent moves by authorities to take people into quarantine facilities if they live on the same or an adjoining floor as a confirmed case. Shanghai authorities on Tuesday said officials were making judgments and risk assessments on a case by case basis. 'The policy is policy, the implementation is implementation, the two are separate,' said one commenter. Another said his girlfriend's parents were taken away and the whole residence isolated despite them not sharing communal areas with a nearby case. 'My girlfriend's parents - two veteran party members who have been party members for more than 40 years - can't help but cry, and they can't figure out whether there is a unified policy.' On Tuesday the WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said his organisation did not think China's zero-Covid policy was 'sustainable considering the behaviour of the virus'. 'We have discussed about this issue with Chinese experts and we indicated that the approach will not be sustainable ... I think a shift would be very important,' he said.", "79681761f737a680b2498118e44549c93be718af64d65525f2197482": "From a stage in the heart of Silicon Valley, London mayor Sadiq Khan called on tech companies to rein in hate speech, speaking about his own experience of abuse amplified by one of the most powerful figures on social media. He was referencing Donald Trump, who frequently used the mayor as an online punching bag, calling Khan 'a stone-cold loser' and 'very dumb'. Khan, whose family are from Pakistan, said the amount of racial abuse he received on social media increased by 2,000% under Trump and required him to receive police protection. 'The worst thing globalization has brought to social media is the proliferation of hate speech,' said Khan, speaking at Stanford University as part of his first visit to the US since the pandemic began. Khan emphasized the power that companies have to act, saying that in the year after Twitter banned Trump over his role in inciting the attack at the US Capitol, he received 'the least racial abuse of any time over five years'. Abuse directed at Khan declined by 75% in 2020, the year Trump lost the election, and a further 40% in 2021 after the ban from Twitter, according to statistics from London's city hall. The speech came just hours after Elon Musk, who is poised to take over Twitter, announced he would allow the former US president to return to the platform. Khan stopped short of condemning Musk's plans, saying he believes 'passionately in freedom of speech' and trusts that those who lead Twitter will 'make sure that you aren't seeing messages that are inciting hatred, that are amplifying division'. 'The question is whether Donald Trump has learned his lesson,' Khan said. 'Everybody should be entitled to be rehabilitated. And if it's the case that Donald Trump is going to use Twitter in a responsible way, then it's all well and good. But if he breaks the rules, there needs to be consequences.' Musk has been vocal about his plans for Twitter after he revealed on 4 April he had become a majority stakeholder in the company and then rapidly negotiated a deal to buy the company for $44bn. He called the decision to ban Trump 'morally bad' and 'foolish in the extreme'. Khan called on tech companies on Tuesday to 'act rationally' and introduce new algorithmic measures to preemptively crack down on hate speech and misinformation. He called the current landscape 'lawless'. 'On the one hand, social media, Facebook, Twitter - great,' he said. 'On the other hand, [the abuse] is the consequence of a lack of control and lack of regulation.' Earlier in the day, Khan spoke from a startup funding center on how Brexit has threatened London's standing as a growing tech hub, and said his mission in California was, in part, to encourage links between Silicon Valley and London. Khan acknowledged the UK's decision to leave the EU threatened to erase the 'huge advantages' of having a single market - one that allows free movement of goods, services and talent. 'We have seen some flight, and that is one of the reasons why I'm in the USA banging the drum for London - we can't be complacent,' he said in an interview with the Guardian. The referendum result has led many companies to flee the UK: more than 440 financial firms left the country after 2016, one 2021 study showed, and those that stayed are facing increasingly confusing fees and paperwork for international trade. However, London has attracted more international tech investment than any other global city, Khan said, citing a study from the promotional group London & Partners. From 2017 to 2021, London saw 251 US tech companies set up there, creating almost 9,000 new jobs, the same study showed. But while statistics show that the 'worst fears' have not materialized, Khan said, the new landscape has underscored the need to keep pushing forward. 'We have to understand post Brexit that we live in a very competitive world,' he said. 'We have to show our strength is not just the tech, but the geography, higher education, and more. That attracts people to come in the first place and keeps them there as well.'", "46703cd8b427cd60f5bff752b2af706dc591f302a46148c4dd447ba7": "Coldplay have been branded 'useful idiots for greenwashing' after announcing a partnership with the Finnish oil company Neste to halve their touring emissions last week. Neste claims to be the world's largest producer of sustainable biofuels, but the firm's palm oil suppliers cleared at least 10,000 hectares (24,710 acres) of forest in countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia between 2019 and 2020, according a study by Friends of the Earth. Carlos Calvo Ambel, a senior director of the Transport and Environment campaign group (T&E) said: 'Neste is cynically using Coldplay to greenwash its reputation. This is a company that is linked to the kind of deforestation that would appal Chris Martin and his fans. It's not too late, they should drop their partnership with Neste now and focus on truly clean solutions instead.' The award-winning rock outfit announced plans to shrink their touring footprint after Martin accepted that a 'backlash' against their emissions record was justified in a BBC interview last year. A tree will be planted for each ticket sold on Coldplay's current 'music of the spheres' world tour, which includes a kinetic-powered dancefloor and other green features. A statement from the band said: 'When we announced this tour, we said that we would try our best to make it as sustainable and low carbon-impact as possible, but that it would be a work in progress. That remains true. We don't claim to have got it all right yet.' 'Before we appointed Neste as supplier of these biofuel products, we received their guarantee that they do not use any virgin materials in their production - most especially not palm oil. It's still our understanding that they use renewable waste products only, like cooking oil and byproducts from wood pulp manufacture.' Hanna Leijala, a spokeswoman for Neste, insisted that the firm 'do not accept any sustainability violations in our own operations.' 'For our collaboration with Coldplay, conventional palm oil was not used as a raw material' she said, adding: 'Neste plans to reduce the share of conventional palm oil to 0% of its global renewable raw material inputs by the end of 2023.' At present, crude palm oil makes up 7% of the firm's fuel inputs. Its jet fuel is blended from used cooking oil, animal fats and other wastes and residues. But Neste declined to say what percentage of the jet fuel mix is made up by palm fatty acid distillates (PFADs), citing 'contractual and competitive reasons.' PFADs are considered a byproduct of palm oil refining by the UK, Germany and most EU countries, but not by Finland.  T&E argues that it is 'dubious' to consider used cooking oil as sustainable when studies suggest that most EU supplies are imports from countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and China. Higher EU prices for used cooking oil incentivises adulteration and EU auditors have criticised Europe's capacity to verify the source of these imports. The use of animal fats also raises questions of agricultural methane emissions, as most fats come from industrial farming, T&E says. Coldplay's world tour has been separately criticised for collaborating with BMW, which is providing 40 rechargeable electric vehicle batteries to power the shows. BMW is an influential lobbyist for the German car industry, according to a report by Influence Map. 'Coldplay have been taken for a ride,' said Eoin Dubsky, the senior campaign manager for Sum Of Us. 'BMW is lobbying to prevent the EU from setting a deadline of 2035 for vehicles to be zero emissions only and they have been able to use Coldplay.' The band's statement said that they had approached other electric car manufacturers but 'BMW were the ones that offered to help'. 'We have no connection to or influence on their corporate policies,' the release continued. 'We just need their batteries so that we can power our shows with renewable energy.' 'We are doing our best, and always genuinely welcome suggestions as to how to do it better,' the band said. Dubsky was sympathetic to their predicament. 'Not many rock bands hire in a sustainability consultant, so credit to them,' he said. 'But I think that they should take greater care when doing their due diligence,' he added.", "2e22ea3b0041603d29fa054da2bd8dc40c4000808b36674f27311fd6": "Boris Johnson was accused of being 'bereft of ideas or purpose,' after a Queen's speech that included 38 new bills but offered no specific measures to tackle the immediate cost of living crisis. Instead, the speech, delivered by the Prince of Wales amid the pomp of the state opening of parliament, included plans to tear up the Human Rights Act, make it harder for councils to rename streets and privatise Channel 4. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the speech showed the government had no guiding principle, while Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, was equally withering. 'British politics is out of ideas,' he said. 'Further action has been promised on the cost of living, but there certainly wasn't any in the Queen's speech. It rightly highlighted the need for growth - the essential precondition for ending our living standards stagnation - but did little to actually bring it about.' With the Queen unable to give the address for the first time in almost 60 years, Prince Charles began by saying: 'My government's priority is to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for families'. However, Johnson's programme for the new parliamentary session included a string of well-trailed and controversial plans, including banning disruptive protests and preventing universities from no-platforming speakers; but few new policies likely to boost the economy in the short term. Instead, the government emphasised help it had already provided, including the temporary energy bill rebate and the cut to the universal credit taper rate. Government sources claimed two-thirds of the planned new laws were aimed at boosting economic growth in the medium and long-term, pointing to the energy security bill, which aims to open up the market for new technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture. Johnson said the country had 'risen to challenges with no precedent in recent history' including the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccine rollout, as well as Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine, the UK's supply of weapons to Kyiv and the sanctions regime that had been imposed. But he warned that 'economic aftershocks' of global crises meant huge disruptions to the global economy. 'No country is immune and no government can realistically shield everyone from the impact,' he said. Responding to the speech in the House of Commons, Starmer said the government had failed to respond to the scale of the looming 'stagflation crisis', while Conservative backbenchers David Davis and John Redwood called for tax cuts. Theresa May's former chief of staff Gavin Barwell tweeted that there was 'lots to like' in the Queen's speech, including a ban on no-fault evictions once promised by May; but he criticised the 'lack of action' on the cost of living, adding, 'both morally and politically the government needs to do more.' Starmer said: 'We need a government of the moment, with the ideas that meet the aspirations of the people.' He claimed that instead, the government was 'bereft of ideas or purpose, without a guiding principle or a roadmap for delivery'. He added: 'Their time has passed.' Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: 'This Queen's speech does nothing to help the millions of families and pensioners facing soaring bills and eye watering inflation. It shows a prime minister refusing to listen to the clear message sent by voters at last week's local elections who are fed up of being taken for granted by this Conservative government.' Away from the cost of living, the government said it would introduce measures to ban no-fault evictions and tackle rogue landlords; and give councils new powers to sell off empty high street properties, in a levelling up and regeneration bill. There were also a series of measures that appeared aimed at allowing the government to pursue 'culture war' issues - including a promise that local people will be consulted before street names are changed; and a ban on councils pursuing political boycotts. Dominic Raab's plan to replace the Human Rights Act with a British bill of rights, aimed at curtailing the power of the European court of human rights in Strasbourg, was confirmed as a government priority. The speech said the legislation would 'ensure there is a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government, strengthening freedom of speech'. The president of the Law Society, Stephanie Boyce, attacked the planned legislation, however, warning it would undermine human rights. 'If the new bill of rights becomes law, it would make it harder for all of us to protect or enforce our rights. 'The proposed changes make the state less accountable. This undermines a crucial element of the rule of law, preventing people from challenging illegitimate uses of power.' The Queens speech also confirmed the fact that proposals for a radical overhaul of the planning system have been ditched, in favour of more modest changes ministers insist will give local people more, not less, say over developments in their neighbourhoods. Previous plans envisaged a zoning system that would introduce a presumption in favour of development in some areas. These were ditched, along with the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick, after the Tories' shock defeat in the Chesham and Amersham byelection was put partly down to fears the government was about to concrete over the green belt. The Treasury was later forced to dampen hopes of an emergency budget to help hard-pressed households, after Johnson suggested in the debate that he and the chancellor would have more to say on the cost of living crisis, 'in the days to come'. Rishi Sunak has repeatedly made clear he is unwilling to act until energy regulator Ofgem has made clear how much it will increase the price cap - an announcement likely to come in August. 'We're not there yet as we don't know where prices are going to land,' said a Treasury source. A No 10 source confirmed there were unlikely to be new spending measures to alleviate the cost of living crisis - but said all cabinet ministers had been tasked with coming up with policies in their areas to help. The government's cost of living committee was due to meet on Tuesday evening, ahead of a cabinet awayday in Staffordshire on Thursday. Proposals mooted at previous meetings included deregulating childcare and making MOTs two-yearly.", "0295dc62bb115ce9eda918359f3d55b7ca32415f2abf97870866921f": "A Labor MP in Australia's most marginal electorate has condemned a 'disgusting smear campaign' from an anti-abortion group backing the Coalition which claims the opposition wants to enact an 'extreme abortion agenda'. Macquarie MP Susan Templeman says the ALP has 'no proposals' to change the law around access to terminations as she faces a concerted campaign from pro-life group Cherish Life for the second election in a row. But the Queensland-based organisation - which is urging its supporters to vote for conservatives George Christensen, Amanda Stoker and Matt Canavan - has refused to back down, stating 'it is not a smear campaign, it is simply the truth'. 'Access to terminations is regulated at a state level and arrangements are well settled,' Templeman told Guardian Australia. 'There are no proposals to change things on either side of politics.' Cherish Life - formerly known as Right to Life Queensland - said it was campaigning to 'keep pro-abortion and pro-euthanasia MPs and parties out of government'. Despite being based in Queensland, the group has distributed political flyers in the New South Wales seat of Macquarie, claiming Labor planned to 'pay for more abortions, even late-term abortions of healthy babies of healthy mothers' and that Templeman was 'in full support of her party's extreme abortion agenda'. In 2019, Cherish Life distributed flyers in several key marginal electorates, including Macquarie, claiming 'more babies would die under a Bill Shorten Labor government' and accusing Labor of an 'extreme late-term abortion agenda'. The 2022 flyers cite as evidence a passage in Labor's 2021 national platform on 'sexual and reproductive health' which notes the party wants to 'expand service provision in the public system'. However, this section refers broadly to reproductive health and contraception, not only abortion. The passage notes Labor 'supports the rights of individuals to make decisions regarding their reproductive health' including 'to continue with their pregnancy'. The party's platform states Labor 'commits to expanding access to sexual and reproductive health care including contraception and termination as well as pregnancy and postnatal care' along with 'other support services'. Cherish Life, which has 10,000 followers on Facebook, is advocating that supporters 'put Labor last'. Macquarie, around the Blue Mountains area west of Sydney, is the most marginal seat in Australia, held by Labor on a margin of just 0.2%. Templeman won in 2019 by just 371 votes, despite the anti-abortion campaign targeting areas of the electorate with relatively high religious populations. 'This is nothing but a disgusting and factually incorrect smear campaign,' she said on Tuesday. Labor sources said they were not aware of the flyers being distributed in any other electorates outside Macquarie. But Cherish Life's executive director, Teeshan Johnson, said the group stood by its claims. She hit back at Labor's criticism and said her organisation planned to target other electorates with similar material. 'It is not a smear campaign, it is simply the truth,' Johnson said. 'The Cherish Life campaign is completely factual. What is 'disgusting' is Labor's national 'free abortions up to birth for any reason' mission, aided and abetted by the many Emily's Listers, like Susan Templeman in the Labor ranks. People like Ms Templeman with extreme pro-abortion views are unfit to govern.' Johnson said Cherish Life was working in 'a number of electorates' beside Macquarie. Stoker, the assistant attorney general and assistant minister for women, addressed Cherish Life's event March for Life in Brisbane on 29 April, saying she wanted to 'build a culture of life'. 'It baffles me that some people have questioned whether I am an appropriate person to serve as assistant minister for women because I am pro-life. They suggest there is some conflict between the roles,' Stoker said at the time. 'But there is no conflict in wanting to support women and the most vulnerable in our community.' Asked about Stoker's attendance at the rally, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said in early May, 'It's a free country.' Guardian Australia contacted Stoker's office for comment. Cherish Life states on its website it has 'no political alignment or affiliation'. Johnson has posted photos on Facebook of herself dressed in a shirt bearing the branding of Coalition MP Bert van Manen and handing out LNP how-to-vote cards in 2019. On its website, Cherish Life recommends supporters vote in the Senate for One Nation candidate and former LNP member Christensen, and Coalition senators Canavan and Stoker. In the lower house, Cherish Life praises Katter's Australian party as 'the highest-ranking party for life, followed by One Nation', but singled out LNP members Luke Howarth and Terry Young as being 'strong and consistent pro-life [politicians]'. Canavan, who also attended the March for Life, told Guardian Australia: 'I think we need more funding [for] hospitals so [we] can reduce waiting times for crucial surgeries not abortions.'", "403b1d4e6f49cb3e074a82815170137ca9726e7e920ee88ec3ef33f9": "A court in El Salvador has sentenced a woman who suffered a miscarriage to 30 years in prison for aggravated homicide, in a case which activists said offers a stark warning to women in the United States, where the supreme court is considering overturning a key ruling which legalized abortion. The woman, identified only as 'Esme', was sentenced on Monday, after nearly two years under pre-trial detention, following her arrest when she sought medical care in a public hospital. 'Esme's sentencing is a devastating step backward for the progress that has been made in the unlawful criminalization of women suffering obstetric emergencies in El Salvador,' said Paula Avila-Guillen, international human rights lawyer and executive director of the Women's Equality Center. Avila-Guillen warned that as the United States faces the possible overturning of Roe v Wade - the 1973 supreme court ruling that effectively legalised abortion - similar cases will become more common across the world. 'We have seen repeatedly throughout Latin America that when abortion is criminalized, women are made to prove that any one of the wide range of obstetric emergencies they experience were in fact emergencies. When they can't or don't have the resources to do so or are simply not believed, they face imprisonment,' she said. 'Everyone in the US should have their eyes on El Salvador right now to understand exactly what a future without Roe entails.' Morena Herrera, the president of The Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion described the sentence as 'a heavy blow', and called for miscarriages to be treated as a public health issue rather than a criminal one. 'We will continue to fight so that all women unjustly criminalized by these circumstances regain their freedom and have the opportunity to remake and rebuild their lives,' she said. El Salvador has some of the world's most draconian abortion laws, with a total ban on the procedure. Unlike in many other Latin American countries, El Salvador does not permit abortion in cases where the child is conceived by rape or incest, or where the health of the mother or child is at risk. Over the past two decades, more than 180 women have been jailed for murder for having an abortion after suffering obstetric emergencies, according to rights groups. Since December, eight women serving long prison sentences have had those sentences commuted.", "8c55026bb194cc6d504cc7ef8eb60b25ba0d33211b49e6f4123a2b11": "New Zealand will fully reopen to the world two months earlier than originally planned, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has announced as part of a wider shake-up to immigration settings. The country swiftly closed the border in March 2020 to prevent the arrival of Covid-19. It has just started reopening to some non-New Zealand citizens and residents over the past few months - beginning with Australians and followed by travellers from 60 visa-waiver countries. From 11.59pm on 31 July, tourists and visa-holders from the rest of the world will also be allowed back for the first time in over two years. The original date had been set for October, but the government long maintained the opening could be brought forward if it was deemed safe to do so. 'This will be welcome news for families, businesses and our migrant communities,' Ardern said on Wednesday. 'It also provides certainty and good preparation time for airlines and cruise ship companies planning a return to New Zealand in the peak spring and summer seasons.' The border announcement is part of a suite of reforms to immigration settings, including streamlining immigration pathways to attract skilled workers back to the country, extending visas for migrants already in the country, allowing cruise ships and international students to return and new settings that will help New Zealand move away from its reliance on low-wage, low-skill migrant labour. The prime minister, who is isolating at home after her partner tested positive for Covid-19, announced the reforms via video link as part of her pre-budget speech. She also reflected on her recent travels, the war in Ukraine, inflation and promoted the government's vision for a stable economic future. The budget will be announced on 19 May and will help set the political scene as the country heads towards a 2023 election. 'We have come through the Covid shock better than almost anywhere in the developed world. Our economy is one of the strongest in the world,' Ardern said. Now it was time to reconnect with the globe, she said. 'New Zealand is in demand and now fully open for business.' The announcement comes a month after warnings the country is at risk of losing high-skilled workers, with government documents estimating 50,000 New Zealanders are poised to leave over the next year. Ardern said reopening New Zealand's borders will help relieve 'urgent skills shortages'. A key part of the immigration reforms is the 'Green List' of hard-to-fill jobs in sectors including construction, engineering, health and technology. The government will aim to attract workers to fill those roles with incentives and a new streamlined application process, the immigration minister, Kris Faafoi, said. 'New Zealand cannot return to pre-pandemic trends that saw us overly reliant on growing numbers of lower-skilled workers and resulted in the increased exploitation of migrants,' Faafoi said. New Zealand has been shown to have the heaviest reliance on temporary migrant workers in the OECD, Ardern added. 'I want to be clear, migrants shape our society for the better in so many ways,' she said. 'But we have a duty of care to everyone, that as we reopen our borders, we do so with a plan in place that means we learn the lessons of the past.' The government said it will also increase local skills through trades training and apprenticeships.", "c88e44487a36de5dfc58cf83ce451b0a072fb352f814cd0d08a97f82": "An Adidas campaign featuring dozens of sets of breasts to promote the diversity of its range of sports bras has been banned by the UK advertising watchdog for using explicit nudity and appearing where children could see the ads. The campaign, versions of which ran on Twitter and select large poster sites, prompted 24 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that the ads were gratuitous, objectified women by 'sexualising them and reducing them to body parts', were harmful and offensive and were able to be seen by children. Adidas UK defended the images, saying they were not gratuitous or sexual but were intended to 'reflect and celebrate different shapes and sizes and illustrate diversity'. The sportswear company said the images had been cropped to protect the identity of the models, and that they had all volunteered and were supportive of the campaign's aims. Adidas added that it had not run the ads on posters or billboards near schools or religious venues, and did not think the campaign would cause harm or distress to children. The ASA said the depiction of naked breasts, including in one ad where pixellation was used to blur the nipples of the models, was 'likely to be seen as explicit nudity'. 'We noted the breasts were the main focus in the ads, and there was less emphasis on the bras themselves, which were only referred to in the accompanying text,' the ASA said. 'As the ads contained explicit nudity, we considered that they required careful targeting to avoid causing offence to those who viewed them.' The ASA said the large poster sites were not targeted and could be seen by people of all ages, including children, and the ads were therefore likely to cause widespread offence. The use of the ad on the Adidas Twitter feed was not in keeping with the usual content posted, the ASA said, and also likely to offend. 'The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of,' ruled the ASA. 'We told Adidas UK to ensure their ads did not cause offence and were targeted responsibly.'

The most recent iteration of the music player, the iPod Touch, has not been updated since 2019, and many of its features are now available on other products. Apple said it would continue to sell the Touch, the only generation of the iPod still on sale, 'while supplies last'. The iPod was released in 2001, and was the first MP3 player capable of storing 1,000 songs. Aside from the Touch, versions included the iPod mini, iPod Nano, and iPod Shuffle. By 2011, Apple held a 70% global market share in MP3 players, and to date more than 400m iPods have been sold. The company stopped selling the Nano and Shuffle, its last standalone music players, in 2017, and industry experts had long predicted the Touch would follow given the prevalence of the iPhone and other smartphones that can be used to listen to music. Later versions of the Touch increasingly resembled smartphones, allowing users to take photos, send emails and make video calls. In a statement announcing the discontinuation, Greg Joswiak, Apple's senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, said the 'spirit of iPod lives on'. 'Music has always been part of our core at Apple, and bringing it to hundreds of millions of users in the way iPod did impacted more than just the music industry - it also redefined how music is discovered, listened to, and shared,' he said.", "f7306ea820de0d66cfd0b7165cb6079a724e81e88fd1ab769a92763f": "", "d105c80a52fbf586598f436e85de4e887e245a7eed3d06a74934bcc5": "As millions of Indonesians travelled to their hometowns to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, one common struggle was being discussed in most family gatherings: the price of cooking oil. 'I always host Eid al-Fitr celebrations for my big family. I cook everything for around 20 of us. But this year is the first time I had to ask them to chip in because everything is so expensive, especially the oil, and I really can't handle it on my own,' Ellifa Kartini said. Palm oil is the most widely used cooking oil in Indonesia. Like many people, Kartini uses it for her family and for her business. She has run a small catering firm from her home in Bekasi, West Java, for 25 years. She also produces and sells traditional cookies. But the rising cost of cooking oil has been extremely difficult for her business. 'Eid al-Fitr is that time of the year when I get the most orders and the biggest revenue. I could produce more than 25kg of fried cookies just for Eid al-Fitr. But this year I decided not to take any orders because the price is just too expensive. And if I raise my cookie price, I know my customers will not want to buy it,' she said. Ellifa said she needs around six litres of cooking oil each week for her business. On normal days it costs around Rp 15,000 ($US1.04) per litre, but for the past few months the price has kept rising , up to Rp 30,000 per litre. 'Before it went up that much, it first disappeared from stores and markets. I have to queue up for hours just to get one litre. Sometimes I even have to go to another district to find it. But when it reached Rp 30,000 per litre I just gave up. The price just doesn't make sense anymore,' she said. Mohammad Faisal, Indonesia executive director at the Centre of Reform on Economics (CORE) said there are two main reasons for the jump in prices: the impact of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Indonesia is the world's largest producer of palm oil. Faisal said last year the country saw a spike in Covid cases and this affected the supply of palm oil. Producers were unable to meet levels of demand as Covid impacted workforces and disrupted output. Separately, supplies of another popular cooking oil - sunflower - have been strained after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine are among the world's main exporters of sunflower oil. In an attempt to boost supplies in Indonesia, president Joko Widodo said from 28 April the government would ban the export of cooking oil and its raw materials . He said the policy was designed to ensure 'abundant and affordable domestic cooking oil supplies'. Kartini has not noticed any change since the export ban and while she has seen many fluctuations in palm oil prices in the past, this is the worst one so far. 'The price skyrocketed too high. But usually changes like this only last around a month, but this is the longest one. How many more months should we suffer?' she asked. According to Statistics Indonesia, the price of palm oil has been rising since October 2021 - and prices have not fallen since the export ban was imposed.  In regions outside Java island, palm oil has become even more scarce. Yulian Juita, 32, who lives in Manggarai, East Nusa Tenggara said cooking oil has been disappearing for months. When it appeared, the price had doubled. 'But I will buy it anyway, because we need it. I'm lucky because I only cook for my toddler and husband. But I try my best to be more frugal when using it,' she said. Juita said she usually uses around three litres a month, but now she tries to only use half that amount. In March, former president Megawati Soekarnoputri caused uproar when she criticised mothers for making so much fried food and said they should boil or steam instead.  'Cooking oil is a very important part of our life, and you cannot underestimate this issue by forcing families to just boil everything instead of frying it. I've tried it, but it is not that simple. I have a three-year-old kid and his favourite food is fried fish. It's challenging to only feed him boiled or steamed food,' Juita said. Some experts have criticised the government's move to ban exports of cooking oil, saying it won't help lower prices. 'In theory, the ban on the export of cooking palm oil and imported raw materials will make domestic supply abundant,' said Rusli Abdullah, researcher at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef). 'However, this does not guarantee that entrepreneurs will release their oil or raw materials when the prices are not attractive,' he said. CORE's Faisal described the move as 'hasty' and says the export ban may have wide-reaching repercussions. 'The ban ... has the potential to cause huge losses to industry players, many of whom could be not related to the cooking oil [ban],' he said. Kartini says she hopes cooking oil prices will come down soon, as her business is the main source of income for her family.  'I hope it will end soon, I'm really afraid that it could affect my ability to pay for my children's education if it keeps going. It's really killing us,' she said.", "7f5694e53c1331510f399f2509d084c535838fdfba7606dab98e4771": "", "946fb7475fa2ff0581d39d52707dd91a5d005819522d94e434e5b1cf": "", "33abaaff0b98af1275a13527cf8788e28318e454b010e93d5bfe3dca": "", "ef40224ca08ff904c132c273162c9c86481f4626e95675cb8d4bc920": "", "b5faecc29258eb5d73201462ec6055aa38dc4aa5c15ed5b3c4d408d3": "", "da8ff0cc85540105efea062165e8390baf63c4d2cc03bbaec3460ea4": "", "7d64f599882128ead3fb784fbec47176205b614f1876c0817df7ccc4": "", "2881a25d1f273ec93419beac6e79bbdabafabe980d181b6378a88116": "", "10d37c974b238bc4cc359a6f07d438f946538f589d867c1e5152a55e": "", "8b79232cf53ae7d520d2d194f7eb395a5c6edc624837b928cf51e2cb": "", "de0328a570b6d231e722891ec2e0fd1b7d5bf341ba703ed4d38f823b": "", "40597674a945e7b039476909fb2bea5337fcf443b2112433b905b5e7": "", "31f5c023af1f109dc48e2d8b1f7482c2d438a7164e85259f06fadfbc": "", "9eaa49c829971eb6bf2e48f65541c7dbff237999d57d3d4931217463": "", "0e1646aaddcb4605326798a3609d1381fd02dd264acdf13d3d691ba8": "", "f7820fb9df66b181e47d0effe8d21ae8fa0d4dc498150c9b085624f3": "", "ca4c5ff5d1459a970ce5306a8f10057195b99806e8fdebde1b1dffa4": "", "9aedfd398e15655f4f98f021df8a572e75df5a89c6a3dd85ef2b327e": "", "04f4245443334eda7353d0993f25819126b54533b47d1603567a5826": "", "e4a8cc2e83bda05543fa6f369d93bf6609db82d809ef92ff84bec748": "The year the world breaches for the first time the 1.5C global heating limit set by international governments is fast approaching, a new forecast shows. The probability of one of the next five years surpassing the limit is now 50%, scientists led by the UK Met Office found. As recently as 2015, there was zero chance of this happening in the following five years. But this surged to 20% in 2020 and 40% in 2021. The global average temperature was 1.1C above pre-industrial levels in 2021. It is also close to certain - 93% - that by 2026 one year will be the hottest ever recorded, beating 2016, when a natural El Nino climate event supercharged temperatures. It is also near certain that the average temperature of the next five years will be higher than the past five years, as the climate crisis intensifies. 'The 1.5C figure is not some random statistic. It is rather an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet,' said Prof Petteri Taalas, head of the World Meteorological Organization, which published the new report. 'For as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise,' said Taalas. 'Alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme.' Natural climate cycles can nudge global temperatures up or down. But the Paris Agreement requires nations to hold the underlying rise, driven by human activities, to well below 2C, as well as pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5C. The world's scientists warned in 2018 that 1.5C of global heating will bring severe impacts to billions of people. 'A single year of exceedance above 1.5C does not mean we have breached the iconic threshold of the Paris Agreement, but it does reveal that we are edging ever closer to a situation where 1.5C could be exceeded for an extended period,' said Dr Leon Hermanson, at the Met Office. 'The possibility of surpassing the 1.5C threshold, even if only for a year, is worrying,' said Dr Andrew King, at the University of Melbourne. 'Our greenhouse gas emissions are still at near-record highs and until we get emissions down to net zero we're going to continue to see global warming. Rapid and drastic emissions reductions are needed urgently.' 'To actually exceed the [Paris] target we'd have to be above 1.5C even in a 'normal' year' unaffected by natural climate variations, said Prof Steven Sherwood at the University of New South Wales. 'But the report reminds us that we are getting uncomfortably close to this target.' The annual forecast harnesses the best prediction systems from climate centres around the world to produce practical information for decision-makers. It found a higher chance of rain in 2022 compared with the average of the past 30 years in northern Europe, the Sahel, north-east Brazil and Australia, while drier conditions than usual are forecast for south-western Europe and south-western North America. Prof Taalas also warned of especially rapid heating at the north pole: 'Arctic warming is disproportionately high and what happens in the Arctic affects all of us.' The shrinking of sea ice and its knock-on effects have been linked to extreme weather events in Europe, the North America and Asia, including heatwaves, floods and even snowstorms. The forecast indicates that the rise in Arctic temperatures will be three times greater than the global average over the next five years.", "acec35561fd4d4fb39a19459c0feb901bee933745006f03ec9ba670a": "As president, Donald Trump repeatedly asked aides if China could be manufacturing hurricanes and sending them to damage the United States, three unnamed former senior officials told Rolling Stone on Tuesday. Trump also reportedly wanted to know if using such a 'hurricane gun' would constitute an act of war, and if so, whether the US could retaliate militarily. China is a major nuclear power. 'It was almost too stupid for words,' one source told the magazine, which said the speaker was 'intimately familiar with the then sitting president's inquiry'. 'I did not get the sense he was joking at all,' the source added. The news comes on the tail of former defense secretary Mark Esper's claim, in a new book, that Trump wanted to hit 'drug labs' in Mexico with missiles and then deny responsibility, and other hair-raising accounts of near foreign policy disaster. Rolling Stone quoted a second former official as saying: 'I was present [once] when he asked if China 'made' hurricanes to send to us. [Trump] wanted to know if the technology existed. One guy in the room responded, 'Not to the best of my knowledge, sir.' 'I kept it together until I got back to my office ... I do not know where the [then-]president would have heard about that ... He was asking about it around the time, maybe a little before, he asked people about nuking hurricanes.' In August 2019, the website Axios reported that in a briefing on hurricanes, Trump told top officials: 'I got it. I got it. Why don't we nuke them?' Trump was reportedly told that aides would 'look into' the notion of destroying large storms with nuclear weapons, which in 2016 National Geographic called 'a really bad idea' with 'a surprising history'. Trump called the Axios story 'ridiculous'. But his interest in hurricanes reared its head again the following week, in what would come to be known as 'Sharpiegate'. At an Oval Office briefing on Hurricane Dorian, Trump held up a National Hurricane Center map that appeared to have been altered with a Sharpie pen, to show the storm hitting Alabama - a baseless claim previously made by Trump. Trump did not comment to Rolling Stone about its 'hurricane gun' story. Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary at the time of Sharpiegate and his reported remark about 'nuking' hurricanes, told the magazine she did not hear conversation about China making hurricanes, but it would not have surprised her if she had. 'Stuff like that was not unusual for him,' Grisham said. 'He would blurt out crazy things all the time, and tell aides to look into it or do something about it.' 'His staff would say they'd look into, knowing that more often than not, he'd forget about it quickly - much like a toddler.'", "6ec0c6f9d62d1cd0258decc526d0dbc2bdc2ff42a945b83760325737": "How migrating animals like sea turtles navigate hundreds to thousands of kilometres across the open ocean has intrigued biologists since Charles Darwin. But some sea turtles might not really know where they're going, new research suggests. Analysis by an international team of scientists has mapped the movements of hawksbill turtles as they swam from their nesting grounds in the Chagos Archipelago to foraging sites also in the Indian Ocean. It found the turtles often travelled in circuitous routes when migrating short distances, suggesting the animals' navigational sense is relatively crude while in the open ocean. The turtles typically travelled twice the required distance to their target locations. One individual swam 1,306km to reach an island that was a mere 176km away - travelling more than seven times the beeline distance. The team tagged and tracked via satellite 22 hawksbill turtles after they had finished nesting. Generally, sea turtles do not forage and nest in the same geographical area. These animals would have already undergone a migration from their foraging grounds, a mating season, and have laid multiple clutches of eggs before preparing for the return trip. Chair in marine science at Deakin University and the study's first author, Prof Graeme Hays, said if the turtles were perfect navigators, they would probably travel in direct paths from their nesting sites to foraging areas in search for food. 'Those turtles that we're tracking - they most probably hadn't eaten for four or five months,' he said. Previous research has suggested that turtles likely imprint on the magnetic field of their birth area - where they later return to lay eggs - and detect changes in the Earth's magnetic field as a means of navigating through the ocean. Hays said the new study suggested the turtles 'almost certainly are using a geomagnetic map, but it's a fairly coarse resolution'.  'So it doesn't allow pinpoint straight-line migration, but it does tell them when they're getting a long way off route,' he said. Hawksbill turtles typically migrate distances of about 150km, a modest distance compared with the migration of green turtles, Hays said. 'For green turtles that nest in the Chagos Archipelago ... we've tracked them going almost 5,000km to their foraging grounds,' he said. 'They'll swim all the way across the Indian Ocean to the mainland African coast. 'Although it's a long journey, in a sense it's actually quite an easy navigational task because all the turtle has to do is swim vaguely westwards and it'll eventually hit Africa.' Though hawksbill turtles were making far shorter migrations in comparison, they had the tricky navigational task of locating small, specific places like remote isolated islands or submerged banks. The new research suggests the turtles' geomagnetic map sense is not fine-grained enough to locate specific targets. When closer to their intended locations, the animals likely use other navigational cues including sense of smell and visual landmarks, Hays said. 'In the final stages, they can smell an island that they're headed to.' 'As they get some sort of visual landmark, for example, the water starts to get a bit shallower and they can see the seabed, then they probably got some sort of cognitive map of that area. They could probably just recognise the seafloor, just like you would recognise visual landmarks in the area where you live.' The research, published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

The German statistics office said the main factor in March was higher energy prices, but this time round it flagged above-average increases in food prices. 'This is where the impact of the war in Ukraine is becoming more and more visible.' Food prices rose 8.6% across all areas: prices for fats and oils jumped 27.3% amid panic-buying at German supermarkets, while meat and meat products rose 11.8%, dairy products and eggs went up 9.4% in price and fresh vegetables became 9.3% dearer. Energy products prices soared again, by 35.3%, compared with March's 39.5% increase. Georg Thiel, president of the Federal Statistics Office, said: Here in Britain, the picture is similarly bleak. A respected UK think tank warns today that more than 250,000 households will 'slide into destitution' next year, taking the total number in extreme poverty to around 1.2m, unless the government acts to help the poorest families hit by the energy price shock,  The National Institute for Economic & Social Research said more than 1.5m households will see the rise in food and energy bills outstrip their disposable income, forcing them to rely on savings or extra borrowing to make up the shortfall, said the thinktank, which blamed welfare spending cuts since the Brexit vote in 2016 for leaving millions of families in a vulnerable financial position. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the German inflation number will reinforce In China, factory gate inflation eased to the slowest rate in a year in April, with the annual rate in producer prices falling to 7.8% from 8.3% in March. The consumer prices index rose at its fastest pace this year, 1.8%, up from 1.5%, but is still below the levels it was at late last year. US stocks managed to eke out some small gains yesterday after the big declines earlier this week. But trading was choppy, and it could have gone either way, said ING analyst Iris Pang. Asian shares rose after trading close to two-year lows the previous day, and the dollar held steady ahead of the US inflation data. China's blue-chip index CSI 300 rose 2.3% after producer prices rose at the slowest pace in a year, leaving room for more fiscal stimulus to shore up the Covid-battered economy. The Hong Kong market rose 1.4% while Australia was little changed. European shares are also expected to open higher.

Liberal party member Shafqat Ali participated in a hybrid session of parliament last Friday, joining with a Zoom-like feed visible only to other parliamentarians. But Conservative members grew suspicious of his surroundings. Conservative MP Laila Goodridge told the House of Commons that a lawmaker 'might be participating in a washroom' somewhere inside parliament - an allegation that baffled the Speaker of the House until it was confirmed by parliamentary pages. On Monday, the Conservative House leader, John Brassard, told parliament that after studying the stonework, door hinges and coat hook, lawmakers had concluded Ali had placed his camera 'on the ledge or ridge on the wall just above the back of the toilet'. 'The member of parliament was literally using the washroom while participating in a sitting of the House of Commons, the cathedral of Canadian democracy,' he said. 'I can't believe I actually just said those words, Madame Speaker.' Ali apologized, calling the incident from a toilet stall in the building's West Block an 'unfortunate event' that arose from a lapse in judgment. 'I take this matter extremely seriously, and I promise never to repeat this error again,' he said. The deputy House speaker, Chris D'Entremont, said Ali's apology was sufficient enough to close the matter - but warned MPs 'to always be vigilant' when participating remotely. 'If you don't have to have the camera on, turn it off,' D'Entremont said. 'If you don't have to be in voting, turn it off.' The bathroom stall incident is the second time the Liberals have been embarrassed by the conduct of a party member participating in parliament remotely. In 2021, Will Amos was spotted naked on camera while changing after a run. He apologized, but then later admitted to urinating in a mug while attending a committee session. He said he would 'seek assistance' and did not run in last year's federal election.", "335c179ab62635537fc699f920caf98f7d6f36a5a4c8fdfcff28d441": "Former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in a New York court to drug and weapons charges as his lawyer pledged to subpoena three former US presidents - and an imprisoned Mexican drug lord - to testify in his defence. Hernandez, who was extradited last month, wore shackles round his ankles at his arraignment in Manhattan on Tuesday, where he pleaded not guilty to three criminal counts, including conspiracy to import cocaine and weapons possession. US prosecutors have accused Hernandez, once seen as a close US ally, of receiving millions of dollars from drug traffickers in exchange for protection from arrest while leading Honduras from 2014 until January of this year. Hernandez used the money to enrich himself and finance his political campaigns, prosecutors said. Outside the court, his lawyer Raymond Colon said that he plans to subpoena Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Donald Trump to vouch for Hernandez, who was the first Honduran president to agree to the extradition of drug traffickers from the country. 'Why not? Biden may be busy running the country, but I can't think of anything that Trump is doing that's important and I know that Mr Obama is retired, so ...' Colon said. Colon also said he would subpoena the Mexican drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, who is serving a life sentence in the US on drug trafficking charges. Earlier, Colon told the judge that Hernandez has been held for three weeks in solitary confinement like a 'prisoner of war'. 'We're not asking for him to get special treatment because he's a former head of state, but these conditions are psychologically debilitating,' he said. 'He's not a terrorist,' Colon said. 'There's no violence in his history.' The former president has been named in a string of court cases in New York, with prosecutors telling one jury that Hernandez had allegedly plotted with a notorious trafficker to 'shove the drugs right up the gringos' noses'. Hernandez has denied the allegations, portraying himself as a fierce opponent of drug cartels and accusing traffickers of smearing him to get revenge and lighten their sentences. The Trump administration turned a blind eye to the accusations while Hernandez continued to bend to the will of its migration agenda. But the Biden administration, which has pledged to fight corruption as part of its plan to address the root causes of migration, shunned the outgoing president during his last months in office. A spokesperson for the US Bureau of Prisons confirmed Hernandez was being held at the Brooklyn detention facility but declined to comment on 'any individual inmate's conditions of confinement'. Judge Kevin Castel set a tentative trial date of 17 January.", "924ef53f48f34d44844ebe65b78fc729a56f0c296b92799ecd490d3a": "Survivors of the brutal regime of the late Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos have described his son's apparent landslide presidential election victory as the product of trickery and disinformation, warning it is unlikely the billions stolen by his family will be recovered, and that human rights in the country will be weakened. Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos Jr had won more than 30.8m votes in a highly divisive presidential election by Monday, according to an unofficial count. His vote tally is more than double that of his closest challenger, the human rights lawyer and current vice-president, Leni Robredo, who had campaigned based on transparency and good governance. Marcos has said he would bridge political divides in his country, urging people: 'Judge me not by my ancestors, but by my actions.' His message has not convinced survivors who were tortured, imprisoned, or whose relatives were killed, during his father's 20-year rule. Nor is it likely to win over critics who want the family to return the vast sums it took from state coffers. As much as $10bn was plundered. The Marcos family and its supporters have attempted to rebrand the rule of Marcos Sr as a golden era of peace and prosperity. Social media has been flooded with false claims relating to the family and its opponents, prompting media and academics to begin factchecking initiatives. Bonifacio Ilagan, convener of Campaign Against the Return of the Marcoses and Martial Law, said Marcos Jr's calls for unity were 'empty and self-serving for as long as he does not address the basic questions concerning his father's dictatorship, of which he was very much a part'. Ilagan was tortured and imprisoned as a student, and his sister was disappeared.'I for one - and I think I can represent a lot - will never accept a president who continues to be the chief administrator of an estate that embodies plunder,' Ilagan said. On Tuesday in Manila, crowds, many wearing black, gathered in front of Commission on Elections office to protesting against the return of the Marcoses, alleging cheating and questioning why results had appeared so quickly. Election officials have rejected claims of rigging and said results were processed more quickly than in previous years because equipment had been upgraded. The results were in line with the findings of opinion surveys conducted by pollsters in the run-up to the election. Activists say that, either way, Marcos did not conduct his campaign fairly. 'He flooded social media with historical distortions and refused to engage the media to answer the painful questions that we wanted him to address,' said Ilagan, who said the campaign was based on 'trickery and historical distortions'. Although Marcos Jr has denied the existence of any organised online campaign, he was the overwhelming beneficiary of false claims circulating on social media. The majority of disinformation was either designed to undermine Robredo's reputation or enhance the images of the Marcoses, according to analysis by the factchecking coalition Tsek.ph, which monitored disinformation in the run-up to the election. Cristina Palabay, secretary general of Karapatan, a human rights NGO, said that Marcos, and his running mate, Sara Duterte, daughter of president Rodrigo Duterte 'represent the worst brand of traditional politics and governance in our nation's history'. 'Under Duterte, the human rights crisis has spiralled with extrajudicial killings, arrests and detention, forcible evacuation and other human rights violations, including violations on press freedom and freedom of association,' Palabay said in a statement. Marcos has said he will not allow prosecutors of the international criminal court to visit the Philippines to investigate Duterte's 'war on drugs', shielding him from prosecution. Survivors of the Marcos regime fear public understanding of the period, already distorted by online misinformation, will be further damaged. 'Although there are efforts now to try to put the correct version in the textbooks of the children, I don't think that's going to be continued,' said Doris Nuval, who was imprisoned for nearly five years under Marcos, the longest of any female political prisoner at the time. 'It's just a sad fact that the young Filipinos will never learn of what's happened until after his term.' '[Marcos Jr] man has absolutely no concept of human rights,' said Nuval. 'I think the human rights community is going to be the worst for it,' she said of a possible Marcos presidency.", "aa17a90b1924d5183c0e5008f83a91b5118776b3e18fb005c1d9eeeb": "Sri Lanka has deployed thousands of troops and police to enforce a curfew after five people were killed in the worst violence in weeks of protests over an unprecedented economic crisis. Nearly 200 people were wounded on Monday as prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned, but that did little to calm public anger. Rajapaksa had to be rescued in a pre-dawn operation by the military on Tuesday after thousands of anti-government protesters stormed his official residence in Colombo overnight, with police firing teargas and warning shots to keep back the crowd. Protesters who forced their way into the capital's 'Temple Trees' residence then attempted to storm the main two-storey building where Rajapaksa was holed up with his immediate family. 'After a pre-dawn operation, the former PM and his family were evacuated to safety by the army,' a top security official told AFP. 'At least 10 petrol bombs were thrown into the compound.' Rajapaksa's evacuation to an undisclosed location followed a day of violent protests in which five people, including a lawmaker, were killed and nearly 200 wounded. The security official said police kept up a barrage of teargas and fired warning shots in the air to hold back mobs at all three entrances to the colonial-era building, a key symbol of state power. Dozens of homes of top Rajapaksa loyalists were torched elsewhere in the curfew-bound country, which has been under a state of emergency since Friday. The emergency order from president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the outgoing premier's younger brother, gave sweeping powers to the military as protests demanding the duo's resignation escalated over the country's worst-ever economic crisis. Protesters and Sri Lankan religious leaders blamed the former prime minister for instigating the family's supporters to attack unarmed protesters on Monday, sparking retaliatory attacks. Rajapaksa's resignation follows months of protests over the country's deepening economic crisis, as once-peaceful protests turned violent. Turmoil began to engulf the country on Monday after violence at a major protest site in Colombo, where pro-government supporters attacked demonstrators and police responded with teargas and water cannon. In one incident just outside Colombo, a politician from the ruling party opened fire on anti-government protesters blocking his car, killing a 27-year-old, and then later took his own life. According to police, another ruling party politician opened fire on protesters in the southern town of Weeraketiya, killing two and wounding five. Mahinda Rajapaksa had been asked to resign by his brother at a special meeting on Friday, in an attempt to appease demonstrators who have been taking to the streets in their thousands since March. Protesters have been calling for both members of Sri Lanka's powerful Rajapaksa political dynasty to be removed from office for mishandling the economy and plunging the country into the worst financial crisis since independence. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was president himself for a decade between 2005 and 2015, had reportedly been resistant to stepping down, but on Monday submitted his letter of resignation to the president. 'Multiple stakeholders have indicated the best solution to the present crisis is the formation of an interim all-party government. Therefore, I have tendered my resignation so the next steps can be taken in accordance with the constitution,' he wrote. The resignation is the latest concession made by the Rajapaksas in the face of protracted anger and protests. The president recently agreed to repeal an amendment to the constitution which had concentrated power in his hands and hand power back to the parliament. Other members of the Rajapaksa family who had previously held seats in the cabinet have also stepped down, with the president the only remaining member of the political family still in power. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, known widely as Gota, has repeatedly said he will not resign as president, despite the clarion call of the protests being 'Gota go home'. The Rajapaksas have largely controlled Sri Lankan politics for two decades, but the economic crisis has rattled their grip on power in the face of mass unrest from those who had previously been supporters of their brand of chauvinist nationalist politics, which pandered to the country's Sinhalese Buddhist majority. Sri Lanka's foreign reserves have dropped so low that the country cannot afford to import basic essentials, leading to shortages of fuel, food and medicines. People have been forced to endure daily power cuts of up to 10 hours, fuelling mass protests across the country since March. Over the weekend, the president declared a state of emergency in the country, the second in recent weeks, in a bid to regain control over the streets. However, Monday marked a violent shift in the demonstrations when hundreds of pro-government supporters gathered outside the prime minister's residence in Colombo and urged Mahinda Rajapaksa not to resign. The group, some armed with sticks and wooden bars, then launched an attack on an anti-government protest camp nearby, with police reportedly looking on as the clashes began.", "ae87c5959e37dd61dc520fbd6c5b14a80a42c6e3732726500e9a0242": "Rebekah Vardy has said she deeply regrets making unflattering personal remarks about Peter Andre in a newspaper interview, as the multimillion pound 'Wagatha Christie' libel trial against Coleen Rooney got under way at the high court. The trial between the two footballer's wives is taking place in a wood-panelled Victorian-era courtroom in central London that has heard many important cases over the years - but this could be the first where physiological matters were discussed at such length. With the leaking of private information at the heart of the much-anticipated case, David Sherborne, acting for Coleen Rooney, asked Vardy whether she was the sort of person who leaked stories to the media. After Vardy said she was not, the lawyer began reading out excerpts from a 2004 interview Vardy once gave to the News of the World about a one-night stand she supposedly had with singer and entertainer Peter Andre. Sherborne quoted Vardy's words from the interview: 'Peter's hung like a small chipolata ... the smallest trouser equipment I've ever seen.' After Vardy confirmed she did not seek Andre's permission to reveal this personal detail in a national newspaper, the barrister asked: 'Did you feel particularly strongly about the size of his manhood that it should be made public?' Vardy insisted she 'deeply regrets' the incident and was coerced into giving the interview to the tabloid against her will by her ex-husband, an allegation the ex-husband has previously denied. The week-long trial pits the two wives of former England footballers - known as Wags - against each other. In 2019, Rooney conducted an elaborate sting operation to find out who was leaking stories from her private Instagram account to journalists at the Sun, ultimately making the public accusation that: 'It's............ Rebekah Vardy's account.' Vardy is now suing Rooney for libel, arguing that the accusation was false. After an earlier ruling, it is up to Rooney to prove Vardy was personally responsible for leaking stories to the Sun - or to convince the judge that publication of the allegation was in the public interest. Rooney and her husband, Wayne Rooney, looked on intently as Vardy gave evidence on Tuesday afternoon. Rooney's lawyers accepted they do not have a smoking gun that shows Vardy - the wife of the Leicester City player Jamie Vardy - actively leaking stories from Rooney's private Instagram account to the Sun. However, Sherborne told the court this did not matter due to the weight of circumstantial evidence against Vardy. 'In essence this is a detective story,' he said. 'Like any good detective story, you never find the person responsible standing over the body with the smoking gun in hand ... There's inference, circumstance, probability and likelihood and ultimately they all add up - so the finger will point to the right suspect or suspects.' In written submissions, Vardy's barrister, Hugh Tomlinson QC, denied his client had personally leaked any stories to the Sun, nor had she approved or condoned 'anyone else to do so on her behalf'. However, the court did hear Vardy has recently realised her former agent and close friend, Caroline Watt, may have briefed stories to the tabloid without her knowledge. Tomlinson said the 'candid' WhatsApp messages previously heard in court between Vardy and Watt showed that 'from time to time they did discuss 'leaking' information to the press'. But only one story - a drink-driving incident involving the Chelsea footballer Danny Drinkwater - was mentioned. As a result, Rooney simply 'can't establish that Mrs Vardy was responsible' for the leaks, Tomlinson told the court. He said that although the 'Wagatha Christie' case was being treated as a form of entertainment by much of the media, his client had been 'subjected to abuse and threats of a horrific nature' as a result of Rooney's allegedly false accusation. Rooney's legal team argue that Vardy and Watt made a concerted effort to destroy evidence, with a litany of technological accidents affecting the retrieval of WhatsApp messages. In one incident, Sheborne highlighted how a 'poor unfortunate phone' belonging to Watt was accidentally dropped off the side of a boat in the North Sea off the coast of Scotland within 'days' of a legal request to search it. In written submissions, Rooney's lawyers said these were not a series of 'unfortunate' incidents. Instead, they claimed the loss of data was part of a 'deliberate and calculated' campaign by Vardy and her team to dispose of potentially incriminating evidence - and prevent a fair trial. Sherborne said it did not make a difference if it was Vardy's agent who leaked stories to the Sun on behalf of the footballer's wife: 'It's like hiring a hitman or woman ... just because you're not the person who gets their hands dirty doesn't mean you're not equally responsible.' He concluded his opening remarks by suggesting the entire case against his client - and the millions of pounds spend on years of legal proceedings - was a pointless endeavour: 'This whole court might just think: 'Why on earth are we here?'' The case continues.", "80fe68d43045c3b72d5b3e334abb4333819c83c9e34da7f1d321ee26": "A Queen's speech without a queen; two future kings and a queen consort in waiting; the state opening of parliament was the most public and formal manifestation yet of 'Operation Transition', which has been quietly going on inside Buckingham Palace for several years. For the first time in two centuries, an heir to the throne read aloud the words compiled by the government at this most ceremonial of spectacles. The crucial difference between George IV, standing in for his mentally incapacitated father George III , and Prince Charles, seated not on the sovereign's throne but on the consort's throne once used by his father Prince Philip, is that the latter is not a formal regent. Charles, in Admiral of the Fleet uniform rather than the robes of state, the imperial state crown representative of sovereign placed on a table in front of where the Queen's throne would have been, was there as a counsellor of state. Flanked by the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke of Cambridge, he was instructed by his mother through Letters Patent, to perform this role and for this day only. The Queen, meanwhile, was understood to be watching on TV from Windsor Castle. But we do not, according to the constitutional expert Prof Vernon Bogdanor, have a 'de facto regency'. 'A regency requires three out of five dignitaries, the Prince of Wales, the lord chancellor, the Speaker of the Commons, the lord chief justice and the master of the rolls, to certify that the Queen is permanently - permanently - incapable of carrying out her duties. That judgment would no doubt be made on doctor's advice. There is no evidence that this is the case,' said Bogdanor, professor of government at King's College, London and author of The Monarchy and the Constitution. 'The criterion is objective. The Queen cannot simply say: 'I cannot carry out my duties.' A voluntary decision she could in theory take is abdication.' But this, he said, was unlikely given her pledge to the nation in 1947. Said by Buckingham Palace to experience 'episodic mobility issues', the Queen has cancelled many engagements over several months. With such uncertainty surrounding her physical capabilities, decisions are now being made on a day-to-day basis. The Letters Patent, issued under section 6(1) of the Regency Act 1937, are a useful instrument in such circumstances, allowing her to entrust counsellors of state to deputise as and when. 'The counsellors of state, unlike the regent, have no decision-making powers; in particular they cannot act on any matter on which the sovereign has the right to question government policy or to make suggestions about it. This is symbolised by the fact they can never act singly,' said Bogdanor. There are currently four: Charles, William, Harry and Andrew. The latter two are clearly problematic at present. And there are certain core constitutional functions that, unless there is a regency, cannot be delegated; such as giving royal assent to legislation, appointing a prime minister, the weekly meeting with the PM and appointing and dismissing governor generals. The presence of William, attending his first state opening also as a counsellor of state, and Camilla, will be seen as by Buckingham Palace as demonstrating the crown is in safe hands as the Queen progressively withdraws from public life. 'She is very much in charge. Charles is deputising for her as he has done before,' said royal historian and author Robert Lacey. 'We are very far from regency. That implies a surrender of authority, which just isn't in her nature. She was born and grew up at the knee of the founder of the house of Windsor. She saw this system being created and she understood it instinctively when she called George V 'Grandpa England''. William's presence was 'significant', Lacey said, in demonstrating continuity. The Sussexes' decision to decamp to the US had resulted in Charles and William becoming closer than ever, he said. The Covid pandemic, too, may have made this transition easier. The Queen, who once said she has to be seen to be believed, may be spending most of her time at Windsor Castle, but has mastered the video technology to ensure she is still seen carrying out virtual engagements. 'So two possible disasters, the split between the brothers and the pandemic, actually work to the advantage of the new system in the future, bringing Charles and William together more as a team and giving the Queen a way to be seen that didn't exist before,' Lacey added. On the two previous occasions the Queen has missed state openings,in 1959 and 1963 due to pregnancy, the lord chancellor had read the government-drafted speech, as was the case when Queen Victoria did not attend. If that had been the case today, it would have meant Dominic Raab performing the duty. But the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 altered the role of lord chancellor, downgrading it from a position incorporating the role of Lord Speaker. 'The current lord chancellor is in the Commons. An alternative might have been the Lord Speaker of the Lords, Lord McFall. But the Prince of Wales gives the right degree of symbolism and pageantry to the occasion in my view,' said Bogdanor. 'Today was a constitutional innovation. But any solution would have been a constitutional innovation.'", "a925d01fd114f579bd2b92ac2fb885340febea7de9edf2ca57c75d09": "Vanuatu's push for the international court of justice to protect vulnerable nations from climate change has received the backing of 1,500 civil society organisations from more than 130 countries, as it heads toward a crucial vote at the UN General Assembly later this year. In 2021 Vanuatu announced its intention to seek an advisory opinion by the international court of justice on the rights of present and future generations to be protected from climate change. If it succeeds, the ICJ's advisory opinion - although non-binding - carries legal weight and moral authority which experts say could help shape international law. The opinion could also influence domestic and regional courts and tribunals when addressing issues relating to climate change. Vanuatu is trying to build support for its motion ahead of the UN General Assembly later this year, at which it needs to secure at least 97 votes, in order for the matter to be referred to the ICJ. The alliance, announced on Friday, represents more than 1,500 civil society organisations (CSOs) from across the globe, including preeminent climate groups from the Pacific: Climate Action Network - International, Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Oxfam in the Pacific, 350 Pacific, Pacific Islands Climate Action Network and Vanuatu Climate Action Network. An independent observer of Vanuatu's campaign said the alliance could put pressure on other nations to support Vanuatu's initiative.  'It throws the weight of these CSOs behind the initiative, which will put pressure on other states to support the initiative. There have been similar proposals before, which have been driven by other Pacific countries, like Palau in 2011, which have been derailed by pressure from rich countries, such as the United States,' said Fleur Ramsay, a Pacific islander lawyer specialising in climate and environmental law with the Environmental Defenders Office. Vanuatu has engaged a Pacific law firm, Blue Ocean Law, to represent them in their campaign for the advisory opinion and has retained external counsel to assist with the development of the legal strategy, including lawyers from the UK, the US, France, Canada, Greece, India, Switzerland and Fiji. Joseph Sikulu, Pacific Director of 350.org said the alliance was an extension of the important advocacy Pacific island nations have been doing on climate change for many years. 'The Pacific has already shown that governments and civil society can work together to achieve impactful change; the 1.5 degree benchmark being ingrained into the Paris Agreement is a testament to that. Through this alliance we hope to continue to weave together advocacy at all levels to build momentum behind the Vanuatu Government's push for this Advisory Opinion.' Vanuatu is one of the countries most affected by the climate crisis, with a combination of climate risks that include sea level and temperature rises, as well as extreme weather events including cyclones, storm surges, landslides, flooding and droughts. It is also among Pacific nations at the forefront of the climate fight. Vanuatu has been a vocal proponent in limiting temperature rise from global warming to 1.5C. The Pacific nation launched an online data modelling tool to perceive and prepare for potential impacts of rising tides and storm surges. It is are also experimenting with crossbreed crop varieties to identify climate resilient crops including taro. Vanuatu ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016 and is one of 43 nations on the Climate Vulnerable Forum. In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2021, Vanuatu prime minister Bob Loughman said: 'The dire consequences of climate change can no longer be ignored, and the science linking climate change to past and present emissions of greenhouse gases is now beyond question. Climate change is driving sea level rise, desertification, disease redistribution, floods, unprecedented 'heat domes', cyclones, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events.'", "6273a2cca7884adf676af204d032f9c3c0eb447688d13bc64032ec20": "", "7b1f0f0e49a6264bc453dacc516dff5745b022fc5f65816d2d40f868": "", "49e3a59b2250fc9d261b600de75257b96f1bef014ee90d70b7469e06": "", "21ffe0b145cb43fa31ff7a29f1537d90c68037895aecfa54f8f0de86": "", "5c5f195a588a6efb793909264ad2a2a9e9fd29bce2a8bbe18acf193d": "", "a65db59abfbc6384cda73c82665077d111e9429025d5a47bb5e51785": "", "7c023f1dbc2c591d4b00e7d3807fb61ee6ae1cb799caf68b6557b3b4": "Name: Prince Harry: travel influencer. Age: Three years and counting. Appearance: Just a regular gap year scruff. Wait, is Prince Harry on a gap year? He has left home, and seems to spend his life ambling around a foreign country without any clear direction, so I guess so. What does any of this have to do with him being a travel influencer? Almost nothing, but remember that job Harry got after leaving the royal family for the US? Chief impact officer at the mental health tech startup BetterUp? No, not that one, the other one. Netflix producer? Podcaster? Author? No, not any of those. His other job, the one where he's the head of ethical travel company Travalyst. No, I didn't know about that. It probably doesn't matter. What's important is that Harry has made a video with New Zealand actors, Rhys Darby and Dave Fane, where he imagines a world in which your holiday gives you a sustainability rating. What? Honestly, life's too short to explain, but essentially it shows Harry visiting New Zealand, where he is rated as a traveller. He scores points for turning off the tap while he brushes his teeth, for example, but loses points for accidentally littering on a beach. Oh no. Does he ... act? Yes, and here's the weird thing. He isn't bad. He isn't nearly as wooden or stilted as you might expect; at times he almost seems like a natural. How wonderful! What's his role? It seems to be 'dimwitted posho'. So, you know, not too demanding. Why is it set in New Zealand? That's easy. It's because Harry feels a deep connection with the Maori people. 'The Maori culture inherently understands sustainable practices and taking better care of our life-giving land, which are critical lessons we can all learn,' he said. Oh, the Indigenous people of New Zealand. That's right. Who found themselves enormously displaced in the 1800s. Yes, that's right. Because Prince Harry's relatives colonised it. Right, I think that's probably enough of that now, thank you very much. Incidentally, does going to Argentina and shooting a water buffalo count as sustainable travel? Look, fine, Prince Harry may not have a perfect history when it comes to travel, but the main thing is that he's trying. Hey, has anyone mentioned what a gigantic carbon footprint he has? It's many times higher than the national average, they say. Prince Harry has been clear on this. Sometimes, he has to make imperfect travel choices to protect his family. From climate change? Jesus, let the man run his vanity startup in peace, would you? Do say: 'New Zealand would appreciate you turning off your tap while you brush your teeth.'

Researchers have described an onslaught of disinformation designed to revise history, enhance the reputation of the Marcoses and undermine their opponents. Many voters are not old enough to remember Marcos's rule, which ended in 1986, and academics warn that the period is not taught thoroughly in schools, creating a vulnerability the Marcoses and their backers have exploited. Many supporters say they do not believe the family has plundered state money, despite numerous court rulings. Some analysts say a Marcos election is a continuation of a populist wave that started with president Rodrigo Duterte and reflects frustration with previous administrations' failure to provide sufficient, tangible reforms following the People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos Sr. Duterte did not officially endorse Marcos as a presidential candidate, nor has he always been complimentary. Last year, Duterte called Marcos Jr a 'spoiled child' and 'weak leader', even as Marcos was campaigning on a joint ticket with his daughter. In a separate speech, he claimed a presidential candidate who had a prominent father, a thinly veiled reference to Marcos, was a cocaine user. During his presidency, however, Duterte has enabled the rehabilitation of the Marcos name, including by recommending Marcos Sr be given a hero's burial with military honours in 2016. 'The propagation of the myth of a golden age under the Marcos dictatorship played to his advantage while he was president,' said Sol Iglesias, assistant professor of political science at the University of the Philippines, who said such narratives were aligned with his own strongman leadership. 'But upon stepping down, his main interest would be avoiding accountability,' she added. Duterte's more recent jibes at Marcos may stem from an irritation that his daughter was running for the vice-presidency, and not the top job. Whoever is president will need to decide whether or not to cooperate with the international criminal court, which has launched an investigation into Duterte's so-called 'war on drugs'. Sara Duterte, 43, first attracted national attention a decade ago, when she punched a local sheriff four times in the head, in front of a crowd of reporters. She was then mayor of Davao City, on the southern island of Mindanao, where the family is extremely powerful. She has previously swapped places with her father as mayor of Davao, and held the role until earlier this year. A motorbike lover, she has the same tough style as her father. However, her rhetoric is less crude and extreme (he has called the pope a 'son of a whore', joked about rape, and once appeared to compare himself to Hitler). Many had anticipated that she would run for the presidency, and last year posters appeared across the country with the words: 'Run, Sara, run'. Running in tandem with Marcos brought together two of the Philippines' most powerful political families, and united their support bases in the north and south of the country. Their partnership reflects not just mutual preservation of their families, but of the broader system of political dynasties that dominate politics in the Philippines, said Iglesias, who referred to reports their partnership was brokered by the former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. 'If she hadn't brokered this tandem, they might have run against each other, and that would have cannibalised their mutually reinforcing bases,' said Iglesias. In such a scenario, victory might have been within the grasp of someone like the vice-president Leni Robredo, a candidate who had promised reform, including an anti-dynasty law. If the results from the initial vote count are confirmed, Marcos Jr will have a huge mandate. However, his campaign was thin on policy detail, and so analysts say it is not clear how he will use this advantage. Marcos may seek to change the 1987 constitution, said Iglesias. For example, he may try to change a rule that bars presidents from seeking re-election at the end of a six-year term. Marcos will inherit a challenging economic situation, added Sonny Africa, executive director of IBON Foundation. 'The last central bank data from the last quarter of 2021 showed that seven out of 10 families don't have any savings at all, whether in the bank or under their mattress,' he said, while huge numbers of small businesses have collapsed. However, the Marcos camp did not provide an overview of how it would tackle these problems, he added. Marcos has said that he would only allow visitors from the international criminal court to enter the country as tourists, preventing its prosecutors from investigating Duterte's 'war on drugs' in the country. He is also expected to pursue closer ties with China, continuing the policy of the Duterte administration.", "ad559a8142c01dfda516259645fd498a36e06818e82a76858b0a23d5": "Throughout the day, women with neatly tied buns slip out of a green door on to a narrow pavement just outside Krakow's medieval market. As young men in US army uniforms go by, trying to make sense of the maps on their phones, the women gather in a nook of a tall grey building to smoke hand-rolled cigarettes and chat. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the building was a hostel offering cheap accommodation to young Europeans Interrailing during their gap year. Now it is home to 80 Romany refugees from Ukraine, nearly all mothers with children. 'I just wish landlords would meet with us before they reject us,' says 42-year-old Nadia, who fled from her village near Donetsk when Russian bombs fell on her neighbour's house in March. She came to Poland with her son's wife, 22-year-old Raiia, her adult daughter, and with seven children between them. While the women have found work in a meat processing factory making hotdog sausages, like other Romany refugees they have hit a wall in finding a home. 'They face discrimination,' says Mariam Masudi a coordinator at the hostel, working for Salam Lab, an NGO. 'Roma are not admitted to other reception points. No one wants to rent to them. I don't know anyone who has managed to settle in Poland. Those who have been able to move out of the hostel have moved abroad.' The official number puts Ukraine's Roma population at 400,000, though experts see that as a low estimate. No one knows how many Ukrainian Roma have arrived in Poland, says Poland's civil rights deputy ombudsman, Hanna Machinska. 'These are large intergenerational families, some of 30 people. Most don't have a precise plan when they arrive in Poland,' she says. 'This situation requires institutional help. Individuals are not able to organise support for such large groups of people.' However, institutional help has not been forthcoming. Most of the relief has been coordinated by self-organised individuals and NGOs, says Joanna Talewicz-Kwiatkowska an anthropologist at the University of Warsaw, who organised the Facebook group, Poland-Roma-Ukraine at the start of the war. 'We wanted to gather information about people in need of help, communicate with central organs and find people ready to host Romany refugees,' she says. 'We didn't think that all responsibility for the situation would be shifted on to us.' Even Nadia's hostel has only been made possible by a private donor from the US who rented out the property until 15 May. That date can often be heard repeated with uncertainty among the women sitting in the hostel's lobby. 'And then what, they throw us out?' one woman says, as she kicks an invisible ball towards the door. This is a question that Karol Wilczynski, director of Salam Lab, cannot answer. 'Without governmental support, we will not manage. There is no way,' he says. Romany refugees face not only a lack of support but outright discrimination, both from relief providers and fellow Ukrainian refugees. The fact that much of the relief effort is provided by self-organised volunteers rather than the government means equal treatment of minorities is difficult to assert. 'In the first days of the war, we saw Poles make beautiful gestures of solidarity towards refugees from Ukraine,' says Talewicz-Kwiatkowska, who is a member of Poland's Roma. 'I would have never imagined we would be here talking about discrimination or dehumanisation, but that is what we are seeing.' According to Talewicz-Kwiatkowska, Roma have been refused access to transport and resources offered by the volunteers welcoming refugees at the border. 'Roma were chased away from reception points, where it was said they were stealing clothes to later sell. We also received information that Romany families and groups were turned away from cars and buses offering transport,' she says. 'Finding accommodation was another challenge, because when someone does not want to have Roma in their car, you can imagine they will not want to invite them under their own roof.' Masudi says that Roma fleeing Ukraine often face discrimination from other refugees. 'When they see Roma at the reception point, the other refugees loudly tell each other to hide their belongings. Roma in Ukraine are used to facing discrimination, and what they experience in Poland is the continuation of this,' she says. When Nadia arrived in Lviv, she says train station staff would not allow her and her family into the boarding area reserved for women and children hoping to travel to Poland. 'Ukrainian women were let in with their pets,' she says. 'But they didn't want to let me on. They didn't believe I was a refugee from Donetsk.' Only after she showed her papers, proving she had come from the east, was she allowed to board the train. 'But still, they wouldn't give me any of the food they were giving out to refugees,' she says. The best option for the Roma in the hostel would be to go west, Masudi says, to countries that are 'more diverse, where they would blend in'. While Talewicz-Kwiatkowska has been able to coordinate with Roma organisations in Sweden and Germany to organise accommodation, many are reluctant to take up the offers. 'They don't want to be far away from Ukraine - they hope they will be able to go back home soon,' she says. Others are afraid to trust foreign help. 'After the war in Yugoslavia, many Roma fell victims to organ sellers. Some are afraid of the situation repeating itself.' Nadia is aware of the stereotypes that follow her, but hopes, as she settles in Poland, she will be able to prove them false. 'When one Romany person steals something, or is fortune-telling, then people think we're all like that,' she says. 'But I don't know how to be a fortune-teller, so what can I do? All I know is how to work a job.'

'There's no telling what we'll find in Lake Mead,' said the former Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman on Monday. 'It's not a bad place to dump a body.' Goodman, as a lawyer, represented mob figures including the ill-fated Anthony 'Tony the Ant' Spilotro before serving three terms as a martini-toting mayor making public appearances with a showgirl on each arm. He declined to name names about who might turn up in the vast reservoir formed by the Hoover Dam between Nevada and Arizona. 'I'm relatively sure it was not Jimmy Hoffa,' he laughed. But he added that a lot of his former clients seemed interested in 'climate control' - mob speak for keeping the lake level up and bodies down in their watery graves. Instead, the world now has climate change, and the surface of Lake Mead has dropped more than 170ft (52 meters) since 1983. The lake that slakes the thirst of 40 million people in cities, farms and tribes across seven south-western states is down to about 30% of capacity. 'If the lake goes down much farther, it's very possible we're going to have some very interesting things surface,' observed Michael Green, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas history professor whose father dealt blackjack for decades at casinos including the Stardust and the Showboat. 'I wouldn't bet the mortgage that we're going to solve who killed Bugsy Siegel,' Green said, referring to the infamous gangster who opened the Flamingo in 1944 on what would become the Strip. Siegel was shot dead in 1947 in Beverly Hills. His assassin has never been identified. 'But I would be willing to bet there are going to be a few more bodies,' Green said. First, the dropping lake level exposed Las Vegas's uppermost drinking water intake on 25 April, forcing the regional water authority to switch to a deep-lake intake it completed in 2020 to continue to supply casinos, suburbs and 2.4 million residents and 40 million tourists a year. The following weekend, boaters spotted the decomposed body of a man in a rusted barrel stuck in the mud of newly exposed shoreline. The corpse has not been identified, but Las Vegas police say he had been shot, probably between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s, according to the shoes found with him. The death is being investigated as a homicide. A few days later, a second barrel was found by a KLAS-TV news crew, not far from the first. It was empty. On Saturday, two sisters from suburban Henderson who were paddle boarding on the lake near a former marina resort noticed bones on a newly surfaced sand bar. Lindsey Melvin, who took photos of their find, said they thought at first it was the skeleton of a bighorn sheep native to the region. A closer look revealed a human jaw with teeth. They called park rangers, and the National Park Service confirmed in a statement that the bones were human. There was no immediate evidence of foul play, Las Vegas police said on Monday, and they are not investigating. A homicide investigation would be opened if the Clark county coroner determines the death was suspicious, the department said in a statement. More bodies will be discovered, predicted Geoff Schumacher, the vice-president of the Mob Museum, a renovated historic downtown Las Vegas post office and federal building that opened in 2012 as the National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement. 'I think a lot of these individuals will likely have been drowning victims,' Schumacher said, referring to boaters and swimmers who have never been found. 'But a barrel has a signature of a mob hit. Stuffing a body in a barrel. Sometimes they would dump it in the water.' He and Green both cited the death of John 'Handsome Johnny' Roselli, a mid-1950s Las Vegas mobster who disappeared in 1976 a few days before his body was found in a 55-gallon (208-liter) steel drum floating off the coast of Miami. David Kohlmeier, a former police officer who now co-hosts a Las Vegas podcast and fledgling TV show called The Problem Solver Show, said on Monday that after offering a $5,000 reward last week for qualified divers to find barrels in the lake, he heard from people in San Diego and Florida willing to try. But National Park Service officials said that is not allowed, and that there are hundreds of barrels in the depths - some dating to the construction of Hoover Dam in the 1930s. Kohlmeier said he also heard from families of missing people and about cases like a man suspected of killing his mother and brother in 1987, a hotel employee who disappeared in 1992, and a father from Utah who vanished in the 1980s. 'You'll probably find remains all throughout Lake Mead,' Kohlmeier said, including Native Americans who were the area's earliest inhabitants. Green said the discoveries have people talking not only about mob hits, but about bringing relief and closure to grieving families.  'People will talk about this for the right reasons and the wrong reasons,' the professor said. 'They're going to think we're going to solve every mob murder ... But it's also worth remembering that the mob did not like murders to take place in the Las Vegas area, because they did not like bad publicity going out under the Las Vegas dateline.' The right reason, Green said, is the visible evidence that the west has a serious water problem. 'The 'bathtub ring' around the lake is big and getting bigger,' he said. Whatever story emerges about the body in the barrel, Goodman predicted it will add to the lore of a city that, with lake water, sprouted from a creosote bush-covered desert to become a marquee gambling mecca. 'When I was the mayor, every time I went to a groundbreaking, I'd begin to shake for fear that somebody I may have run into over the years will be uncovered,' he said. 'We have a very interesting background,' Goodman added. 'It certainly adds to the mystique of Las Vegas.'", "0d87359e9bab8ea4864bd109330cee0cc6adf250d653f6290037bb11": "The pandemic turned the US into a next-day delivery nation. Amazon, in particular, saw sales surge during the dark days of Covid. In the first three months of 2021, the company watched its total sales tick up by 44%, constituting $8.1bn in profit. Those sales were led by the 200 million subscribers to Amazon's super-fast delivery service Prime as people demanded everything from desk chairs to bananas delivered the next day. Amazon sold 44% more items during the pandemic, but the cost of fulfilling those orders increased by only 31%. This saving was one of scale - high-order volume allowed Amazon to operate even more efficiently. 'It has run its warehouses closer to full capacity, and delivery drivers have made more stops on their routes, with less time driving between customers,' reported the New York Times. During that period of lockdowns, Amazon's quick delivery became a lifeline for many people. But as we approach a return to a more normal life, many of us are investigating the various habits and proclivities we unconsciously established during Covid. Do we want to go back to the office? Are we satisfied with our current employment situation? And is the endless cycle of cardboard arriving at our doorsteps putting an undue strain on the planet, on our infrastructure, and on the human spirit? Amazon Prime ships about 1.6m packages a day. That operation is buoyed by a worldwide logistics team which rumbles all day and night. Isn't that a little gluttonous? Or, as M Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, put it in an interview with NPR: 'You don't need a pair of socks to get to you swiftly. It probably makes just as much sense to get it to you efficiently.' For Amazon workers, this means working at an extraordinary pace. Jacob, who joined Amazon two years ago, says he has logged a total of 30,000 miles, and 400 routes. He is frequently saddled with shifts that force him to deliver to '70 separate three-story buildings' with more than 350 packages. 'I was logging over 120 flights of stairs on my Fitbit,' he tells the Guardian. 'Amazon constantly reminds us they put profits over their workers,' he says. 'I ended up having a normal 200-plus stop day on Easter Sunday. Zero mercy shown.' The physical toll bears out in the data. According to a survey of workers in a Long Island Amazon warehouse, 42% reported physical pain in their day-to-day duties - usually in the feet and lower back. (They also noted psychological pressures and a deterioration of their normal sleep schedules.) 'I do feel like the workload is unreasonable,' says another driver interviewed by the Guardian, who asked to remain anonymous. 'There is no time to break. It is impossible to complete a route, and take your breaks, and be back to the station in time.' In the past eight years there have been hundreds of accidents involving Amazon vehicles, including at least six deaths, which were documented in BuzzFeed News investigation in 2019. But it is difficult to know the exact figures, given the way Amazon outsources its delivery apparatus to a worldwide network of companies. In total, BuzzFeed identified at least 250 outsourced dispatchers who work with Amazon. In many cities Amazon is promising packages in as little as five hours, or tells customers they can order by midnight and receive products the next morning. Would more time to make deliveries lead to a more equitable work environment? Jacob says an earlier cutoff for next-day delivery orders could give Amazon employees more time to breathe, but he also isn't sure if customers would accept having to wait longer. 'The standard has been raised,' he says. There are also questions about how sustainable this relentless pace is within the climate emergency. There are two differing philosophies about the emission impact of next-day delivery. Some argue that by streamlining the flow of products - bundling up all of our assorted consumption needs into parcels on a shared conveyor belt - we are taking the cars off the road that would previously be making routine trips to local strip malls. 'The question is always, 'What are we replacing?'' says Miguel Jaller, a professor at UC Davis and co-director of the Sustainable Freight Research program. 'If you're replacing a two-gallon-per-mile large SUV going every day to a store far away, then we're benefiting the environment.' Amazon has claimed it will reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 (and has already made some strides in that arena - they remain the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy). But given the sheer diversity of items available on Amazon and other e-commerce retailers, experts say it becomes more difficult to assert that next-day delivery streamlines the supply chain. The average Prime order might constitute radically different items, which are both guaranteed to make it to your doorstep in 24 hours or less. 'It gets harder to consolidate,' Anne Goodchild, a professor of engineering at the University of Washington, told Vox. 'I think it's easy to overlook how much travel we're adding.' This is complicated further by Amazon's reliance on contract labor, many of which use trucks that are considerably smaller than the giant 18-wheelers that haul fresh stock to bricks-and-mortar retailers, and generally carry a much heavier carbon footprint given their limited storage space. (In total, those vehicles are responsible for one0quarter of all carbon emissions in the transportation category.) In general, Jaller is unconvinced that the industry's continued focus on speed above everything lends itself to a carbon-neutral model. 'They started pushing one-day delivery and then they started pushing one-hour delivery. The faster you're providing a service, the less likely you're able to be [environmentally] efficient,' he says. Jaller does recommend a few remediesincluding a pivot to zero-emission vehicles. But generally speaking, experts believe that the path towards a sustainable, livable, non-exploitative future must begin with a shift in our social priorities. 'It's not a massive chunk of your total environmental impact, but every decision a consumer makes has some impact,' says Austin Whitman, CEO of the non-profit Climate Neutral, when I asked him if he believes next-day delivery can coexist within the ethical posture of any conscious shopper. 'Should you put it on your list of the top 10 things to avoid? Absolutely.' Kai Lendwehr, the press officer of the environmental non-profit MyClimate, agrees. He advocates for a reorientation in the relentless parameters of consumption. Instead of searching for a supply-chain apparatus that sustainably satiates our demands, maybe we simply need to be wondering if we truly need the things we're purchasing in the first place. 'It's about conscious buying,' he says. 'Decide what you need, do some research, focus on quality, on things that make you feel suitable for a longer timeframe, and then click the green button. It shouldn't really matter when the product arrives.'", "c4ca2664ac7c91a02f3f7b49042f192d7c0722d058ba99615cc47dfa": "'You put your babies in the womb, you will be held accountable!' yelled Steve Corson, tall, bearded and jabbing a finger at women who chanted back: 'My body, my choice!' Corson took a deep breath and blew into a shofar. Then Nathan Darnell, wearing a 'Jesus Christ is king' cap and holding aloft a cross, grabbed a megaphone. 'You guys are demon-possessed!' declared the 19-year-old from Haymarket, Virginia. 'You guys are controlled by demons, all of you. Every child has a right to life.' Suddenly Darnell was surrounded by abortion rights protesters brandishing placards. He kept talking. 'You guys are evil. The downfall of America is because of every one of you.' The national day of prayer last Thursday was anything but a solemn occasion outside the supreme court in Washington, where hours earlier an unscalable black fence had been erected, reminiscent of the one that surrounded the US Capitol after the January 6 insurrection. The fury was unleashed by a leaked draft opinion that showed the nation's highest court provisionally voted to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that effectively legalised abortion. It was a political earthquake that revealed American women are perilously close to losing a fundamental right. It was also a milestone in America's seemingly inexorable journey from United States to divided states. The likely demise of Roe v Wade could drive the biggest wedge yet between what appear to be two irreconcilable nations coexisting under one flag. Liberal states would become sanctuaries for women seeking abortions and saturated with providers; conservative states would turn into deserts that ban the procedure and criminalise doctors who provide it. Some wonder if the country's social fabric, frayed by four years of Donald Trump's presidency, can survive. 'The death of Roe is going to tear America apart,' ran the headline of a New York Times column by Michelle Goldberg, which concluded that 'the death of Roe will intensify our national animus, turning red states and blue into mutually hostile legal territories. You think we hate each other now? Just wait until the new round of lawsuits start.' Simon Schama, a historian, tweeted: 'When Roe vs Wade is overturned it will be time to find a different name for this country.' The supreme court's draft majority opinion, written by Samuel Alito and circulated on 10 February, was leaked to Politico on Monday. It argued in contemptuous tones that Roe v Wade 'was egregiously wrong from the start' and 'enflamed debate and deepened division'. Four other Republican-appointed justices - Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - agreed that Roe 'must be overruled'. If that decision becomes final, possibly next month, it will tear down a national precedent and turn America into a chaotic legal patchwork. The first restrictions would take effect in 13 states with so-called trigger laws to be enacted once Roe is overturned. Some such laws ban abortions almost completely while others would outlaw it after six or 15 weeks. The speed of trigger laws could vary. In Texas, a near-total ban would go into effect 30 days after a supreme court decision. The Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organisation, estimates that 26 of 50 states are certain or likely to ban abortion if Roe is overturned, leaving women in swaths of the south-west and midwest without access. In 11 states there would be no exemptions for rape and incest. Republicans in Louisiana are even considering a bill that would allow prosecutors to charge those having abortions with homicide. Most states where abortion would still be legal are on the west coast or in the north-east. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, on Monday proposed enshrining a right to abortion in the state constitution. In Oregon, Democrats recently passed a bill to create a $15m fund to assist with the costs of abortion, including for women from outside the state. Women might have to travel hundreds of miles to get an abortion. This is likely to be especially difficult for women in poverty, often including women of colour, and lead to a sharp climb in unsafe abortions. Republican-led states have already made efforts to restrict abortion pills, which can be prescribed through online visits. There have been fierce disputes over healthcare, immigration and race in recent years - the journalist Carl Bernstein has spoken of a 'cold civil war' - but few can match the raw emotional power of reproductive rights. That much was clear outside the fortified supreme court on Thursday, as two vociferous groups faced off. Rev Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition, said into a microphone: 'We look forward to the day when abortion ends up on the scrap heap of history like chattel slavery and segregation.' Rochelle Rubin, about 20 paces away, shouted: 'You don't have a uterus! Shut up!' Her voice shaking, Rubin, 50, an estate agent and lawyer, explained later: 'This is personal for me. I was born the last year that women could not have abortions. My mother had no choice. Had she made the choice she would have had me, but women of her generation did not have choice. 'If I didn't have a choice, my life would be very different today than it would have been. Ten years years ago I exercised my choice and had an abortion. For 50 years you can have a right - and it could be taken away by five people.' Even as abortion rights activists shouted 'Keep your rosaries off my ovaries!' and held placards such as 'Women's bodies are more regulated than guns', Mahoney said he was 'overjoyed' by the draft opinion but acknowledged the societal shockwaves. He said: 'Can America get any more divided than we are? Tragically, yes it can. We certainly saw that happen on January 6, which was tragic. I would say we have to find a way to address this. Let's deal locally so if you have California on one end and Alabama on another end, let's just work on that.' Mahoney, 68, added: 'What you see on the streets is the cutting edge of the cultural fault lines that we see in our country. We saw that with the tragic murder of George Floyd. But our nation went through this upheaval and we're moving forward so that's what I hope happens here.' The interview was repeatedly interrupted as Mahoney broke off to restrain fellow anti-abortion activists from confronting female protesters. 'That's not who we are,' he said, and it was true that women from the opposing sides engaged in civil conversations while in fundamental disagreement. But Corson, 65, from Fredonia, Arizona, gripping his shofar and the Stars and Stripes, was more aggressive. He said: 'I don't respect their view at all. They didn't come out with 'My body, my choice' when it came to the [Covid] vaccine. 'They have a human body inside them; we speak for that human body; they're just speaking for themselves. I get sick and tired of these people. They are very corrupt and evil and on the wrong side. It is going to get heated up, no doubt about it. It should. It's a good issue to get heated up about.' The great divide on abortion is not a 50-50 split. It is asymmetric. A poll released by the Data for Progress thinktank after this week's leak showed voters wanted to keep Roe by a two-to-one margin. Democrats, independents and more than a third of Republicans support it. Its imminent fall is due to a quirk of US democracy that skews the electoral college, Senate and supreme court out of kilter with the popular will. Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Coney Barrett were appointed by Trump, who lost the national popular vote by 3m, after Senate Republicans blocked Barack Obama's last nominee, Merrick Garland. This sense of injustice at this democratic deficit - which gives significantly more representation to white citizens than citizens of colour - is only likely to incite anger and dissent as blue states go one way and red states go the other. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said: 'The basic structure of politics with all these small rural states being essentially overrepresented is creating the situation where minorities can control the majority. People are going to be furious about it. 'Already friends of mine in New York City talk about not letting their tax dollars go to red states because the irony is that all the blue states send more money to the federal government than they get back and the goddam red states take all the money and then try to run the lives of everybody in the blue states. 'So there really is a war going on and it's a cultural war but it's one that they [Republicans] are destined to lose.' If Roe is struck down, Kamarck noted, it will be the clearest differentiation of rights by state since the era of Jim Crow, when some states racially segregated public places and others did not. This could be a recipe for battles over sovereignty, with red states passing laws to 'extradite' anyone who helps their residents get an abortion and blue states passing laws to shield their own doctors. States have been drifting apart for years, across fault lines characterised as liberal v conservative, Black v white, urban v rural, college-educated v blue collar, Hollywood v heartland, mask wearers v vaccine sceptics and MSNBC v Fox News. The 2016 presidential election was framed as Trump's 'deplorables' against Hillary Clinton's 'coastal elites'. The supreme court looks ready to toss a grenade into the mix. Barbara Walter, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, and author of How Civil Wars Start: And How to Stop Them, said: 'What I fear will happen is that it will further create this urban-rural divide where the more moderate and liberal voices in blue states will move, or their children will move, because they will not want their rights restricted. 'If you're a big corporation that employs a lot of women, are you going to move to states where they and their daughters are not treated equally or they're under these increasingly restrictive and medieval laws?' The fight is under way. A liberal group published the addresses of conservative supreme court justices and encouraged protesters to walk by them. A day of action for abortion rights is planned for Saturday. The issue could also galvanise Democratic turnout in November's midterm elections. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic congressman from California, said: 'There will be an effort to turn out young women and their male allies when that decision comes. I hope it doesn't have to happen but I think it's going to be the backfire of the century for Republicans.' The Senate will vote on legislation that would codify abortion rights into federal law but Democrats do not have 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster, which means the Joe Biden-backed effort will fail. There have never been so few Republicans who support abortion rights, nor have there ever been so few Democrats who call themselves 'pro-life'. Fareed Zakaria, an author and broadcaster, warned in the Washington Post: 'You cannot really understand America anymore by looking at averages. It has become two countries. One is urban, more educated, multiracial, secular and largely left of center. The other is rural, less educated, religious, white and largely right of center.' Blue America would fit comfortably with northern European Protestant countries, Zakaria said, while red America's cultural values make it closer to Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. 'For the country's political future, the central question is now this: can these two Americas find a way to live, work, cooperate with and tolerate one another? If not, the abortion battle may be the precursor to even larger struggles.'", "01b590f231e045c10309aac88994ad9c804491b87a02ae8e17183151": "It was in 1986 that the dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his family were forced to leave the Philippines in disgrace. Helicopters airlifted the family from the Malacanang Palace, as protesters filled the streets. Marcos Sr, after ruling with an iron fist for 20 years, had been toppled by a popular uprising, the People Power Revolution. Crowds stormed the abandoned palace, discovering the extent of the family's opulence. There were grand artworks, boxes of commemorative gold coins, lavish jewellery, hundreds of gowns, dresses, and, infamously, an enormous collection of designer shoes belonging to the former first lady, Imelda Marcos. Analysts say that, ever since the family was ousted, it has been intent on forging a comeback. In the documentary The Kingmaker, Imelda Marcos described it as her son's destiny to become the president. Now he is on the cusp of doing so. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, 'known as Bongbong', was educated in the Philippines and at a boarding school in England. An extract from Marcos Sr's diary suggests the family was concerned his son lacked the 'character' needed for the future. 'Bongbong is our principal worry. He is too carefree and lazy,' he writes, adding later: 'I have told him that since we have enemies, he will have to fight the battles I fought in the past against myself and against circumstance.' Marcos Jr began studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford, but, according to the university, did not complete a degree course and was awarded a special diploma in social sciences. Marcos insists he graduated with the equivalent of a degree. After university, Marcos Jr became the vice-governor of his home province, Ilocos Norte, on the north-western tip of Luzon, at the age of 23 and later governor. He was 29 when his father was ousted and the family was forced to leave the Philippines. Marcos Sr died in exile in 1989. However, the family was allowed to return to the country in the 1990s. Marcos Jr then began to re-establish his political career, again becoming governor in Ilocos Norte, the family's stronghold, a congressman and a senator. In 2016, he ran for vice-president but lost to Leni Robredo - an outcome he unsuccessfully challenged in court. Robredo lost to him in the 2022 presidential race. Marcos is married to the lawyer Louise Araneta-Marcos, known as Liza, with whom he has three sons. The eldest, Ferdinand Alexander Marcos III, known as Sandro, is running for the first district congressional seat of Ilocos Norte, and has developed a prominent social media presence where he is received adoringly by young female supporters. The family continues to face numerous court cases over their plundered wealth, which is estimated to be as high as $10bn. Imelda is appealing against a 2018 criminal conviction on seven corruption charges. Marcos Jr has been unapologetic about his family's past and has downplayed or denied abuses under his father's rule. He praised his father as a 'political genius', and his mother as the dynasty's 'supreme politician' during a recent interview with CNN Philippines. Under martial law, which was imposed by Marcos in 1972, thousands of Marcos critics were arrested, tortured and killed. Marcos Jr's camp, and its supporters, have portrayed the Marcos years as a time when the country was thriving and prosperous. Online misinformation about the era has inundated social media, prompting media groups and academics to form factchecking initiatives. Marcos Jr's appeal has relied on nostalgia relating to his father's rule, say analysts. 'He did not inherit the political savvy or the appeal or the charm of the father,' said Prof Maria Ela L Atienza, who teaches political science at the University of the Philippines. 'He's basically living off or campaigning on the basis of the name of the father.' His campaign, which carried the slogan 'together we shall rise again', promised unity and a return to what he has portrayed to be a former greatness. He has also pledged to prioritise jobs and lower the cost of living, including bringing down the cost of rice, though critics say such proposals are lacking in detail. His opponents fear the return of the family to power could lead to the reversal of democratic gains made in the country since his father was toppled in 1986.", "c3587315d4639d4abd7d36dedc0dcc016f6e48c30c56ede896cfc126": "Nature charity Plantlife is asking people to not mow their lawns in May as part of the No Mow May campaign to keep gardens wild and encourage wilder lawns.

Landlocked Hungary relies on Russian oil from a single pipeline and Orban has warned he cannot approve the European Commission's proposed sixth package of EU sanctions against Moscow. 'This evening's discussion with PM Viktor Orban was helpful to clarify issues related to sanctions and energy security,' von der Leyen tweeted. The two leaders discussed the issue during a meeting in Budapest. 'We made progress, but further work is needed,' she said, adding she would organise a videoconference call 'with regional players to strengthen regional cooperation on oil infrastructure'. Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto also said the two sides 'made progress' but that they still had plenty to discuss. 'We cannot make the Hungarian people pay the costs of this war,' he said in a video posted on Facebook, according to Reuters. Before the leaders' talks, Orban's international spokesman Zoltan Kovacs, citing Szijjarto, compared the sanctions package to an 'atomic bomb' for Hungary's economy. 'Hungary will not vote for the EU Commission's initiative on sanctions against Russia because it poses a problem for Hungary and does not contain a proposal for a solution,' he tweeted. 'The proposal is like an atomic bomb for the Hungary economy and would destroy our stable energy supply.' Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the international community to take immediate steps to end a Russian blockade of his country's ports in order to allow wheat shipments and to prevent a global food crisis. Ukraine's major Black Sea port of Odesa for exporting agricultural products was struck by missiles on Monday. Charles Michel, President of the European Council, visited Odesa and said he saw silos full of grain, wheat and corn that was ready for export but blocked. 'This badly needed food is stranded because of the Russian war and blockade of Black Sea ports. Causing dramatic consequences for vulnerable countries. We need a global response,' he said. Russia's underestimation of Ukrainian resistance and its 'best case scenario' planning have led to 'demonstrable operational failings, preventing President Putin from announcing significant military success in Ukraine' at the 9 May Victory Day parade, the UK's ministry of defence has said. According to the latest British intelligence report, Russia's invasion plan is highly likely to have been based on the mistaken assumption that it would encounter limited resistance and would be able to encircle and bypass population centres rapidly. The White House has dismissed a Victory Day speech by Russian president Vladimir Putin as 'revisionist history' and said his suggestion that western aggression led to the Ukraine war was 'patently absurd'. Speaking to reporters during a press briefing on Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Putin's speech was 'revisionist history that took the form of disinformation'. Psaki said 9 May is supposed to be 'about celebrating peace and unity in Europe and the defeat of Nazis in World War Two' but instead 'Putin is perverting history' to justify his unprovoked and unjustified war. US Congressional Democrats have agreed to provide a further $39.8bn in additional aid for Ukraine, two sources familiar with the proposal told Reuters on Monday. The House of Representatives could pass the plan, which exceeds president Joe Biden's request last month for $33bn, as soon as Tuesday, and Senate leaders said they were also prepared to move quickly, the news agency reports. Biden on 28 April asked Congress for $33bn to support Ukraine, including more than $20bn in military assistance. The new proposal includes an additional $3.4bn for military aid and $3.4bn in humanitarian aid, the sources said. A statement released by the White House read: Democrats and Republicans both reportedly said they supported more aid for Ukraine and would approve emergency funding quickly, but it was delayed by disputes between the parties over whether additional funding for Covid-19 relief or stiffer immigration controls should be included. Earlier on Monday, Biden signed the Ukraine Democracy Defence Lend-Lease Act of 2022 to streamline the supply of US weapons and other material to Ukraine or eastern European countries. The lend-lease act, streamlining the flow of military equipment, 'is based on a WWII-era program to help Europe resist Hitler', the White House said. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian's live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I'm Samantha Lock and I'll be bringing you all the latest developments until my colleague Martin Belam in London takes the reins a little later. It is just after 8am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: ", "5fb03def5d427c832e5daa1b84b2ee322cc16ee4e16ad1b4e43d934b": "The head of the UN human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has warned that the civilian death toll in Ukraine is thousands higher than the official toll of 3,381, with deaths in the port city of Mariupol alone likely to add significantly to the total. 'We have been working on estimates, but all I can say for now is that it is thousands higher than the numbers we have currently given to you,' Matilda Bogner, the head of the UN human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, told a press briefing in Geneva, when asked about the total number of deaths and injuries. 'The big black hole is really Mariupol, where it has been difficult for us to fully access and to get fully corroborated information,' she said. The warning was delivered as dozens more bodies were discovered in the ruins of a burnt out and collapsed five-storey building in Izium in the Kharkiv region, and as the UN migration agency said 8 million people were internally displaced inside Ukraine by the conflict. 'This is another horrible war crime of the Russian occupiers against the civilian population!' Oleh Synehubov, the head of Kharkiv's regional administration, said in a social media message announcing the deaths. As both Ukrainian and Russian military officials claimed advances in the battles for the country's south and east, dominated by a 300-mile-long frontline, the latest phase of the campaign appeared to have settled for now into a grim back and forth struggle over shell smashed villages and small towns. In the Kharkiv area in particular, the conflict has turned into a long-range shelling war between the two sides. After unexpectedly fierce resistance forced the Kremlin to abandon its effort to storm Kyiv more than a month ago, Moscow's forces have concentrated on capturing the Donbas, Ukraine's eastern industrial region. Further west, Ukraine's vital Black Sea port of Odesa came under repeated missile attack, including from some hypersonic missiles, after Russia marked its biggest patriotic holiday without giving new information about the war. One person was killed and five were wounded, the military said. As part of the barrage, a Russian supersonic bomber fired three hypersonic missiles, according to the Center for Defence Strategies, a Ukrainian thinktank tracking the war. The centre identified the weapons used as Kinzhal - or 'Dagger' - hypersonic air-to-surface missiles although there was no independent verification of what missiles were used. The strikes on Odesa come amid warnings from the Ukrainian military's general staff of an elevated missile threat across the country, including claims Russia has increased the number of naval missile carriers operating in the Black Sea. With the conflict on both sides being defined by intense Russian shelling by artillery and rocket systems, CNN quoted an unnamed defence official on Monday saying the Ukraine military had received 85 of 90 M777 long-range field howitzers promised by the US, along with 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition out of 184,000 promised. The defence official said the US military in Europe completed the training of 310 Ukrainian service personnel in handling howitzers with a further 50 undergoing training. In Mariupol itself, fierce fighting was continuing around the area of the Azovstal steel mill where about 2,000 Ukrainian defenders are still holding out. Despite claims that all civilians who had been sheltering there had been evacuated, it was claimed on Tuesday about 100 were still inside the sprawling plant. One of the Ukrainian fighters holding out at the steel plant said they were still defending the city. Valeri Paditel, who heads the border guards in the Donetsk region, said the fighters were 'doing everything to make those who defend the city in the future proud'. While assessments by western defence and intelligence officials, as well as military analysts have focused on the shortcomings of the Russian operation and the heavy losses of men and equipment sustained, there was little evidence of an end in sight for Moscow's campaign. 'Without concrete steps to build a new force, Russia can't fight a long war, and the clock starts ticking on the failure of their army in Ukraine,' said Phillips P O'Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews. Russia has about 97 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) in Ukraine, largely in the east and the south, a slight increase over last week, according to a senior US. A further 19 BTGs are reported to be just across the Russian border near the city of Belgorod.", "07c595215e60d2d000a3e836842ce301701e1f612b68b0c44c0407d3": "Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the international community to take immediate steps to end a Russian blockade of his country's ports in order to allow wheat shipments and prevent a global food crisis. The Black Sea export port of Odesa was struck by missiles on Monday. Zelenskiy said: 'For the first time in decades there is no usual movement of the merchant fleet, no usual port functioning in Odesa. Probably this has never happened in Odesa since world war two. 'Without our agricultural exports, dozens of countries in different parts of the world are already on the brink of food shortages. And over time, the situation can become downright terrible ... This is a direct consequence of Russian aggression, which can be overcome only together - by all Europeans, by the whole free world. It can be overcome by putting pressure on Russia, by effectively forcing Russia to stop this disgraceful war.' Charles Michel, president of the European Council, visited Odesa on Monday and said he saw silos full of grain, wheat and corn unable to be exported. 'This badly needed food is stranded because of the Russian war and blockade of Black Sea ports. Causing dramatic consequences for vulnerable countries. We need a global response.' In the US, congressional Democrats have reportedly agreed to provide as soon as Tuesday another $39.8bn in additional aid for Ukraine, exceeding President Joe Biden's request last month for $33bn including more than $20bn in military assistance. Senate leaders were prepared to move quickly to enact the new proposal, reports said, which includes an additional $3.4bn for military aid and $3.4bn in humanitarian aid. Biden said: 'This aid has been critical to Ukraine's success on the battlefield. We cannot allow our shipments of assistance to stop while we await further congressional action. A bill that Biden signed into law on Monday allows quicker supply of military equipment to Ukraine. Before signing the bill, Biden said 'Putin's war' was 'once more bringing wanton destruction of Europe,' drawing reference to the significance of Victory Day. 'It really matters,' Biden said of the bipartisan support for Ukraine. One of the bill's chief Republican sponsors, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, said: 'I'm glad America could act as the arsenal of democracy for this critical partner.' On Monday Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, used Victory in Europe Day - the anniversary of Germany's unconditional surrender in 1945, and Russia's biggest patriotic holiday - to rally his people behind the invasion. The White House dismissed the speech by Putin as 'revisionist history' and said his suggestion that western aggression led to the Ukraine war was 'patently absurd.' In Poland, Russia's ambassador was pelted with red paint by anti-war protesters as he went to lay flowers at the Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw. In another step forward in building pressure on Russia, the EU chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said she made 'progress' on a proposed Russian oil embargo during talks with the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, one of Putin's closest friends in Europe, who has held up EU attempts to phase out Russian oil. France's president, Emmanuel Macron, has meanwhile poured cold water on Ukraine's desire for fast-track EU membership, saying it could take 'decades'. Macron suggested building a broader political bloc that could also include Britain. On the ground in Ukraine, the governor of Lugansk reported 'very serious battles' in the frontline areas of Bilogorivka and Rubizhne. In Mariupol - where it was speculated Putin had sought total control by Victory Day - a small contingent of depleted Ukrainian forces have continued their defence of a final bastion at the Azovstal steelworks. Ukraine's defence ministry said Russian forces backed by tanks and artillery were conducting 'storming operations' on the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol where the city's last defenders are holed up. Full control of Mariupol would allow Moscow to create a land bridge between the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014, and eastern regions run by pro-Russian separatists. In Odesa, one person was killed and five injured when seven missiles hit a shopping centre and a depot, Ukraine's armed forces said. Air raid sirens sounded as the missiles interrupted a meeting between the European Council president, Charles Michel, who was visiting Odesa, and the Ukraininan prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, forcing them into a bomb shelter. In other developments: With Reuters, AFP and Associated Press", "7aa535dad5d121748635f1aed341f79fbbd1391bd73dae4131326ef9": "France has said a deal on a proposed EU ban on Russian oil could be struck this week, despite opposition from the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, who has compared the plans to an atomic bomb. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, held a phone call with Orban in an effort to break the deadlock over the latest round of EU sanctions, the sixth since the eve of the invasion. There were 'contacts at all levels to ensure we have a global deal on this sixth package', a spokesperson at the Elysee Palace said after the call. Clement Beaune, a Macron ally and France's Europe minister, said he thought 'we could strike a deal this week'. Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen said there had been progress after making a last-minute dash to Budapest to discuss the plans with Orban on Monday night. The European Commission president described the discussion as 'helpful to clarify issues related to sanctions and energy security'. 'We made progress, but further work is needed,' she added, promising to hold a video conference with other countries in the region to boost cooperation on oil infrastructure. EU diplomats insist all 27 member states are united behind the idea of a ban on Russian oil, with sources close to the talks describing the delay as technical rather than political. However, the EU had hoped to announce the oil embargo and a new set of sanctions on influential Russians before last weekend, following Von der Leyen's presentation of the plans at the European parliament last Wednesday. About a quarter of the EU's oil comes from Russia, but some countries use far more. Slovakia and Hungary, landlocked countries that are nearly 100%-dependent on Russian oil, have been offered a delay in imposing the oil embargo until the end of 2024, to enable them to overhaul their refineries. The Czech Republic has been offered a delay until June 2024, while the full ban would come into force for the rest of the EU by the end of this year. Orban said last week that 'in its present form' the proposal was 'tantamount to dropping a nuclear bomb on the Hungarian economy'. The Hungarian foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, repeated the phrase before Monday's talks with Von der Leyen, according to Orban's international spokesperson, Zoltan Kovacs. Hungary says it needs five years and hundreds of billions of forints to convert its Szazhalombatta refinery near Budapest, which can only take Russian oil. Hungarian officials say they could get oil from Croatia, but this would require their southern neighbour to boost its capacity. A European Commission spokesperson said on Tuesday that Von der Leyen had been invited by Orban to discuss 'issues related to European energy security and supply' and had gone to Budapest 'to listen and to search for solutions jointly'. The discussion did not go into timelines on phasing out Russian oil in Hungary, the spokesperson said, but focused on oil transportation infrastructure. Orban has also threatened to block attempts to sanction Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox church, who has described the attack on Ukraine as a 'religious cleansing operation'. Speaking on Hungarian radio last week, Orban said the Orthodox community in Hungary had written to him protesting about the cleric's inclusion on a draft list that would mean a travel ban and asset freezes in the EU. Orban said he opposed imposing sanctions on church leaders 'because that would affect the religious freedom of communities in Hungary, which is sacrosanct'.", "035b0de1f47cc21e7171d79c941245933c79b5999cea6ed3d5c20acf": "When the first Russian bombs fell on Ukraine, Myroslava Marchenko was a gynaecologist at a private clinic in Kyiv. The next day, one of her patients was due to have an abortion after prenatal tests showed a high chance of Down's syndrome. Instead, like millions across the country, Marchenko and her patient fled to safety, crossing the border into Poland where abortions due to foetal abnormalities - or 'on eugenic grounds' in the language of the country's constitutional tribunal - are illegal. 'She called me and said, 'Oh, my God, I don't know what to do, because time is running out and my pregnancy is growing, but I don't want to raise this child because it's war, and I can't manage it,'' Marchenko recalls. It was, she says, the first time that she understood the impact that Poland's abortion laws, and the barriers that had been erected to prevent women accessing emergency contraception, could have on individual lives. Marchenko told her patient she should leave Poland and travel to the Czech Republic in order to access a safe termination. More than 2 million Ukrainians have found refuge in Poland since the beginning of the war in February; the vast majority are women with children. While the two countries share history, culture and a border, women's access to reproductive healthcare is radically different. In Ukraine, abortions are legally provided on request in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, oral contraception is sold over the counter without prescription and the morning-after pill is readily available. In Poland, abortion is almost completely outlawed and access to contraception is ranked as the worst in Europe, according to the European Parliamentary Forum. Many doctors refuse to prescribe emergency contraception or even IUDs (intrauterine devices) on ethical grounds, arguing that they are akin to an abortion. Oxana Lytvynenko, a Ukrainian reproductive rights activist who has lived in Poland for 16 years and has been helping refugees in reception points since the war began, says that some women have no idea that their access to reproductive healthcare services will vanish upon crossing the border. '[Ukrainian refugees crossing the border] are completely unprepared for the situation here, they don't know the law. Even if someone has read an article somewhere about abortion in Poland, [many] still think, 'OK, so they don't do abortion on demand, but if there is a good reason then they will do it,'' she says. 'It's difficult because you don't want to re-traumatise these women just after they are so happy to be safe again. It doesn't feel like the right moment to tell them the truth.' Lytvynenko says she has met women at the border who have asked her to help them access medication to terminate a pregnancy, but says that the ability to access reproductive healthcare services is down to chance. 'If women in need of abortion pills cross the border, it really depends who they are met by,' she says. 'If it is someone progressive, feminist, then they'll be able to put them in touch with right people. But if it is some random man, or someone religious, then no way. They'll either not care or they'll say it is God's angel and you need to keep it.' Members of Poland's anti-abortion movement have also been at the border to greet refugees. Within the first weeks of the war, volunteers from the Life and Family group started handing out leaflets at refugee reception points depicting dismembered foetuses and citing abortion as the biggest threat to peace. The leaflets also advised pregnant women to denounce to the police anyone offering them an abortion. While Marchenko waits to receive a Polish medical licence she has been working with Federa, a Polish women's rights organisation, to launch a Ukrainian-language hotline for women seeking help on where to access reproductive healthcare services. She says the hotline receives about 10 calls a day, 10% of which are queries on how to access an abortion. Some of the questions Marchenko receives come from women with planned pregnancies who no longer feel able to give birth living as a refugee. Others are from women who became pregnant after joining their husbands who were already working in Poland before the war. 'Even though there is a war, questions of reproduction are still there, especially as many women have not yet managed to secure contraception,' she says. Aborcyjny Dream Team, a group that aids women in sourcing abortion tablets from abroad, says 158 Ukrainians have turned to them for help since the beginning of the conflict. As evidence and reports of rape and sexual assault of Ukrainian citizens continue to emerge, activists and politicians in Poland are also becoming increasingly concerned about how rape victims seeking safety in Poland may be able to secure a legal abortion if needed. Between 2010 and 2020, fewer than five legal abortions a year were carried out in Poland on the grounds of rape, with women needing permission from a prosecutor. Leftwing politicians recently suggested amendments to a recent bill passing through the Polish government on the reception of Ukrainian refugees, which would force prosecutors to issue the necessary documentation within a seven-day period. The proposal was rejected by the Sejm, the lower chamber of the Polish parliament. 'My only hope is that none of the Ukrainian women who need an abortion try to get it legally in Poland,' said Lytvynenko. 'I hope they just keep driving westward to Germany. Because once they declare the pregnancy to the doctor, it'll be over for them.'

In response, online, anonymous volunteers - such as those under the Twitter account Great Translation Movement - have exposed China's pro-Russia propaganda by highlighting mistranslations that falsely blame Ukrainian troops for bombings and atrocities perpetrated by Russian forces against civilians. On 21 April, an article published by the Guardian revealed how civilians, who died during the Russian occupation of the Ukrainian city of Bucha, were killed by tiny metal arrows called flechettes, from shells of a type fired by Russian artillery. However, the South Review, an official state media and subsidiary of the Chinese Communist party, owned by the Guangzhou Daily newspaper group, mistranslated the article, claiming the flechette rounds were fired by Ukrainian forces. 'The UK Guardian published the first postmortem findings of the Bucha incidents: they were caused by Ukraine shelling Bucha,' reads the article from South Review. On Weibo, a military-focused account with more than 4.7 million followers added: 'Although the Guardian normally publishes anti-Russian comments, this time the forensic doctor's report turned out to be the exact opposite.' (When checked by the Guardian on 6 May, the author had since modified this Weibo entry). The apparently mistranslated article caused much controversy even on China's heavily monitored social media. Many English-speaking users of Weibo pointed out the mistake. On 27 April, China Fact Check, under the Shanghai-based the Paper news website, clarified and said it was 'mistranslation'. On other occasions, despite Chinese officials preaching a neutral stance on the conflict in Ukraine, pro-Russia social media accounts have manipulated the news coming from the Ukrainian front. For example, on 8 April, in Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, two Russian ballistic missiles exploded over the railway station, dropping cluster munitions, killing 59 people and injuring hundreds of passengers. The same day, a popular military Weibo account with more than 34 million followers falsely claimed the attack was carried out by Ukrainian troops. Towards the end of the entry, the account added a hashtag that suggested US labs in Ukraine were working on eight severely infectious diseases. ''In China's EN-CN dictionary, Russia translates into Ukraine,' the Great Translation Movement, which has about 150,000 followers, said on Twitter. Born shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Great Translation Movement - a Twitter account and a related hashtag that identifies itself as 'fourth estate' and 'holds muck-rake in hand, wears crown from gutter' - has been a source for English-language speakers to understand how state-linked Chinese social media discuss the war in Ukraine. The decentralised anonymous group is operated by several hundred volunteers around the world. For security reasons, they say, they do not know geographical locations of fellow contributors. But they were glued together by the same mission: contradicting Beijing's propaganda and naming and shaming those in China who support Putin's military adventure in his neighbour. 'To put it simply, the context behind everything is the colossal gulf between the different types of messaging that the Chinese government shapes for the rest of the world, versus that of within China,' they said in a written statement. Debates about Russia's invasion do exist in China, but on social media, which is heavily monitored, views similar to those in the western media are often met with censorship. Anti-western commentators of the events toe a Kremlin line, blaming Nato and the US for what they call 'special military actions'. Last month, some Chinese pundits went so far as to question whether the killings in Bucha were a 'staged performance'. '[A]fter all, Zelenskiy is an actor doing what actors are trained to do,' said a military commentator on Phoenix TV. A month earlier, the same pundit said Russia's invasion was 'in self-defence' in the face of US pressure. But as the Great Translation Movement began its crusade against pro-Russian misinformation, Chinese state media also launched their own campaign to discredit it. The nationalist tabloid the Global Times, for example, has since March published a number of articles accusing it of being a part of the 'anti-China force'. It even compared the account to the anti-communist McCarthyist crusade in 1950s America. 'Such a despicable 'movement' has a large potential audience, mostly in the west,' wrote one piece on 31 March. 'Some of them are novelty-seeking and feel superior on a cultural level. In light of China's rapid rise and the west's decline, these people need an illusional superiority to feel better.'", "687cdf60f081e4020895740b28ee408c758ae714f476e28db1d70654": "Russian hackers are seeking to target western countries supporting Ukraine in its efforts to resist Moscow's invasion, the head of GCHQ has said. Jeremy Fleming, the director of the British spy agency, said in a speech on Tuesday morning that while fears of a fully fledged online war between Russia and Ukraine had perhaps failed to materialise, there remained 'plenty' of cyber activity as part of the conflict. As well as affecting Ukraine directly, there had been 'some spillover of activity affecting other countries', Fleming said, and evidence that Russian actors were trying to escalate the conflict further afield. 'We've seen indications that Russia's cyber operatives continue to look for targets in countries that oppose their actions,' the GCHQ chief said. 'That's why we have increased our efforts to ensure UK businesses and government urgently improve levels of cyber resilience.' Fleming did not provide extra evidence, but last month, Britain's National Cyber Security Agency, an arm of GCHQ, joined forces with its US counterpart, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in producing an advisory notice warning against a potential Russian escalation. At the time they warned there was a risk some Russian criminal hackers 'have recently publicly pledged support for the Russian government' and that they could be willing to engage 'in retaliation for perceived cyber offensives against the Russian government or the Russian people'. Russia has been accused of staging more than 200 cyber-attacks on Ukraine since launching its invasion on 24 February, according to an analysis from Microsoft, targeting government agencies and media companies with hacking attempts or destructive malware designed to disable systems. Fleming said the UK, in conjunction with the US and other allies, was engaged in continuing 'to support Ukraine in shoring up their cyber defences' - a recognition that the country is the frontline of what could yet spread into an international cyber conflict. Last month, Ukraine said Russian hackers had tried to take out the country's power grid, and came close to cutting off power for about 2 million people using a variant of the Industroyer malware. Although these attacks were aimed at Ukraine, there remains the risk that such malware could spread uncontrolled. In 2017, Russian state actors launched the NotPetya malware against Ukrainian companies, but it spread indiscriminately around the world, affecting a string of western companies and even some Russian corporations. Western spy agencies have previously said that attack was also conducted by operatives from the GRU, or main intelligence directorate of the Russian army. Fleming also used his speech to highlight that the National Cyber Force (NCF), a new offensive hacker group, run jointly by GCHQ and the Ministry of Defence, was involved in tackling cybercrime. 'Through the NCF we are actively undermining the cybercriminals' assumption that they can act with impunity on the internet. We have disrupted criminals, making it clear that they are being observed, and going after their ability to profit from illegal activities,' he said. The NCF activities have included actions to prevent cybercriminals 'from profiting from their crimes' - though it was not spelled out how - and 'denying them access to their cyber tools and malware' which are used to carry out attacks. Later this month, Fleming added, Suella Braverman, the attorney general, would set out further details on how far the NCF can go in its efforts to maintain national security. She would 'set out the government's latest legal views on the responsible use of cyber capabilities', he said.", "0762c5860f633ccf4a0e2516178a55656e88474673b3c9af406bd5e9": "A recent rise in dolphin deaths in the Black Sea may have been caused by the war in Ukraine, scientists have said. Researchers believe heightened noise pollution in the northern Black Sea, caused by about 20 Russian navy vessels and ongoing military activities, may have been driving cetaceans south to Turkish and Bulgarian shores, where they are being stranded or caught in fishing nets in unusually high numbers. Since the beginning of the war, Turkey has recorded a rise in strandings of the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) across its Black Sea coast. More than 80 of the animals were found dead across the country's western Black Sea, which the Turkish Marine Research Foundation (Tudav) described as 'an extraordinary increase'. Initial investigations by Tudav revealed that about half of these dolphins were killed after getting entangled in fishing nets. The fate of the other half, however, is still an 'unanswered question', according to Dr Bayram Ozturk, the chair of Tudav, as no signs of entanglement or gunshot wounds could be found on the carcasses. 'Acoustic trauma is one of the possibilities that come to mind,' Ozturk said, although he stressed it was important to remain cautious. 'We don't have proof on what low frequency sonar may cause in the Black Sea because we have never seen this many ships, and this much noise for such an extended time - and science always demands proof.' Navies commonly rely on sonar to detect enemy submarines from great distances. Because marine mammals also depend on sound for communication and other functions, the underwater noise can have serious, even fatal, effects on cetaceans. According to Dr Pavel Gol'din, a researcher at Ukraine's National Academy of Sciences, while acoustic trauma may explain the strandings, constant underwater noise caused by military activities could explain the higher bycatch rate. Permanent underwater noise may not kill the animals directly, but could still seriously disturb and harm them, he said, as dolphins and other species may head for unfamiliar territory to try to avoid it. 'It might be the cause of mass migration of fish and cetacean stocks to the south,' he said. Dimitar Popov, a project manager for Green Balkans, a Bulgarian conservation organisation, agrees with this theory. He has detected a similar trend in Bulgarian waters, mostly among Black Sea harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena relicta). Green Balkans has been monitoring the bycatch of cetaceans in turbot fishing for four years. Throughout this period, bycatch was lowest during spring months and peaked in summer. This spring, by contrast, Popov said, 50 cetaceans had become entangled in 72 kilometres of nets, a number close to the peak figure from summer 2019. Scientists say their investigations are hampered by the fact there are no protocols to protect marine mammals during the war. 'There are dozens of ships in the Black Sea but we don't even know how often they use sonar,' Ozturk said. The scientists say a lack of access to information is not only hindering research into cetacean deaths, but also making it hard to track which animals are most at risk. These are likely to include harbour porpoises, which should be migrating from the Black Sea towards the war-stricken Sea of Azov, as well as migratory birds that spend part of the year at the rich wetlands in the northern Black Sea.", "bc1a313cb57087fe78aadd6781f479db1d9f6664369eef1df55dfd30": "The Spanish government has sacked the country's spy chief, Paz Esteban, as it tries to contain the fallout from a cyber-espionage scandal that has engulfed the ruling coalition and raised further questions about the use of controversial Pegasus spyware in Spain and beyond. Esteban's dismissal on Tuesday came amid growing political tensions and almost two years after a joint investigation by the Guardian and El Pais first revealed that senior pro-independence Catalan politicians were warned their mobile phones had been targeted using the spyware. The scandal has intensified over recent weeks after cybersecurity experts at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said at least 63 people connected with the Catalan independence movement had been targeted or infected with Pegasus spyware between 2017 and 2020. It has also emerged that the mobile phones of the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, the defence minister, Margarita Robles, and the interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, were subjected to 'illicit' and 'external' targeting using Pegasus last year. The Spanish government has not commented on which foreign country may have been responsible. Last week, Esteban reportedly confirmed to a congressional committee that 18 members of the Catalan independence movement - including the current Catalan regional president, Pere Aragones - were spied on with judicial approval by Spain's national intelligence centre (CNI). At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, the government said Esteban - the first woman to head the CNI - had been relieved of her post and would be replaced by another female intelligence veteran, Esperanza Casteleiro. Robles, whose ministry oversees the CNI, admitted there had been 'shortcomings' and said the change represented a 'new step' for the centre and a chance for it to address 'things that could obviously be improved'. She attempted to brush off reporters' questions about whether Esteban had been fired over intelligence failures relating to the targeting of the phones of cabinet members. 'You talk about firing but I'd call it a replacement - with one civil servant from the centre replacing another civil servant from the centre,' said Robles. '[Casteleiro] knows the centre very well, has worked there for almost 40 years, and is working for Spain.' She added: 'Although I think there may be reasons for feeling proud and satisfied, we're going to keep on working to make sure that there are no cracks in the total, general sphere of security so that Spanish citizens feel safe.' Robles said the government and all its agencies acted in full accordance with the law - 'it's legality, legality, and more legality'. She also said she hoped the documents Esteban had shown the congressional committee would eventually be declassified so that people could see the CNI had followed the law and acted with judicial authorisation. Aragones's pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party - a key parliamentary ally for Sanchez's minority government - had demanded Madrid take measures to restore confidence in light of the allegations in the Citizen Lab report. Aragones said the spying scandal was 'dynamiting' attempts to find a negotiated solution to the Catalan independence crisis. However, the government's decision to sack Esteban was immediately denounced by its opponents. Alberto Nunez Feijoo, the new leader of Spain's conservative People's party, accused the prime minister of selling out his intelligence chief to appease the Catalan president and his supporters. 'It's grotesque to see Sanchez offering the independence movement the head of the director of the CNI - he's once again weakening the state to try to ensure his survival,' Nunez Feijoo tweeted. 'It's a real slap in the face for our country. Unjustifiable.' But Gabriel Rufian, the spokesperson for the Catalan Republican Left party, said the Spanish government had merely done what needed to be done. 'The mobile phones of three of the most protected and important people in this country - the prime minister, the defence minister and the interior minister - were spied on,' he said. 'Accepting political responsibilities isn't a concession to the independence movement, it's a concession to common sense.' The issue has caused further divisions between the Socialist party and its junior partners in the Unidas Podemos alliance, who had called for the resignation of Robles. The alleged spying and the government's handling of it have also been criticised by Amnesty International. 'The Spanish government can't use the security of the Spanish state as an excuse to cover up possible human rights violations,' Esteban Beltran, the head of Amnesty Spain, said last week. He said the official secrets committee 'is characterised by secrecy and obscurantism [and] cannot be the right place to investigate possible human rights violations'. Sanchez's Spanish Socialist Workers' party (PSOE) last week joined the three parties on the Spanish right in vetoing a parliamentary inquiry into the Pegasus scandal. A PSOE spokesperson said the mooted congressional committee was not needed because an internal investigation by the CNI was already under way, as was an inquiry by the public ombudsman. It remains unclear whether or not the software alleged to have been used by the CNI against the Catalan targets was Pegasus, which, according to its manufacturers, is sold only to governments to track criminals and terrorists.", "db8d69b89c77de2f931c27896a0644598253b49385429ea01bb394a4": "Starmer says Britain can do more than just 'get Brexit done'. But the country needs more than what this government is offering. He says the Queen's speech was 'thin' and 'bereft of ideas or purpose, without a guiding principle, or a roadmap for delivery'. He says he would like to think the worst is over. But the country is 'staring down the barrel of something we haven't seen in decades - a stagflation crisis [rising inflation and rising unemployment].' The government should be introducing a windfall tax, he says. This is from Pat McFadden, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, on the Treasury briefing saying there are no plans for an imminent announcement about helping people with the cost of living, as Boris Johnson implied. (See 4.05pm.) McFadden said: Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, is speaking in the debate now. He says the Lib Dems want an emergency cut in VAT. On Northern Ireland, May says there was no reference in the Queen's speech to a Northern Ireland protocol bill. She says a bill of the kind the government is said to be considering, giving it the power to ditch parts of the protocol (see 12.11pm), would not be a good idea. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, says the Northern Ireland protocol has to be dealt with. May says she put forward a Brexit plan that would have avoided new checks at the Northern Ireland/Great Britain border. But the DUP opposed that plan, she says. She also says she is disappointed there is no employment bill in the Queen's speech. That would have allowed the government to legislate to allow waiters and waitresses to keep their tips. And she says she is disappointed the government is not legislating to set up an independent public advocate - something the Tories promised in their 2017 manifesto. After backbench speeches from Sir Peter Bottomley and Meg Hillier, Theresa May the former prime minister is speaking now. She says she is glad the government now seems to be addressing the problem of no-fault evictions. She says her government wanted to address this. But she says she is concerned by reports that Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, favours letting people in a street vote to decide whether a housing application in their street should be allowed. She says she can see that plan backfiring. Lewis Goodall from Newsnight says the claim from Boris Johnson that his Rwanda asylum plan is just a rehash of a New Labour proposal (see 3.39pm) is highly misleading. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart, confirming that when Boris Johnson said in his speech that the government would be saying more about helping people with the cost of living in the days to come (see 3.32pm), he almost certainly meant months not days. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, is speaking now. He begins by thanking the Prince of Wales for coming to parliament today, calling him by one of his Scottish titles, the Duke of Rothesay. He says Boris Johnson did not listen to the message from last week's elections, which was that people want him out of office. And he contrasts the Conservatives' electoral performance with the SNP's. The SNP are still gaining votes and seats, despite being in office a long time, he says. He says the party has won eight elections under Nicola Sturgeon's leadership. From my colleague John Crace Johnson has now finished. His speech was delivered with a bit more verve than Keir Starmer's, but was even weaker on substance. Its most notable feature was the implicit promise of a cost of living bailout that appears not to exist. This is from Kate McCann from Talk TV. Referring to Keir Starmer as the 'leader of the opposition of the moment', in a joke about the slogan used by Starmer in his own speech, Johnson criticises Labour for not backing the plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. He claims New Labour looked at something similar when it was in power. Johnson's comment about help for people being announced in the coming days (see 3.32pm) was not a reference to an emergency budget, the Times' Steven Swinford reports. Johnson claims Labour would not approve new nuclear power stations. He calls them 'great quivering jellies of indecision'. Sarah Owen (Lab) asks Johnson for an apology to pensioners and children who are going hungry, and to people who lost relatives during the Covid pandemic. In response, Johnson rattles off a list of measures helping pensioners and children. But what the country really needs is a strong economy, he says. He says that would not have happened under Labour because the country would have remained in lockdown. Johnson says the UK had the fastest growth in the G7 last year, and will return to that next year. That will give the government the 'fiscal firepower' to help families with the pressures they face. The government will continue to use 'all our ingenuity and compassion for as long as it takes' to help people, he says. He says 'the chancellor and I will be saying more about this in the days to come'. (It is not clear from this whether, by 'in the days to come', Johnson literally means in the days to come, or whether he means at some point before the autumn. Until recently the government has been signalling that the next big announcement about help for people with the cost of living will not come until late summer, when the government has a better sense of what will happen to energy prices in the autumn.) Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says we come to the 'halfway point of this parliament' - quashing speculation that an early election might be on the cards. After some broadbrush claims about the government, he pays tribute to MPs who have died: David Amess, James Brokenshire and Jack Dromey. Starmer has finished. It was rather a poor speech, that got worse and worse as it went along.  One mistake was to structure it around a slogan - 'government of the moment' - that will mean little to many people.  This is from Jim Pickard from the Financial Times. And this is from Paul Waugh from the i.", "94800c9bb591573761972e948076e809dc1a937efce813f9889b48fb": "Liz Truss is reportedly preparing draft legislation that would unilaterally scrap key parts of the Northern Ireland protocol, removing the need for checks on goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. No bill was announced in the Queen's speech on Tuesday but the foreign secretary is reported to have asked officials to prepare the draft, which would put the UK in breach of its treaty obligations. As well as scrapping checks, the draft legislation would also take away powers of the European court of justice and remove all requirement for Northern Irish businesses to follow EU regulations. A government source confirmed Truss intended to move unilaterally to prepare to change parts of the protocol but denied the UK government had given up on negotiation. Truss is understood to have formed the view that the UK cannot wait for negotiations to conclude before preparing to act unilaterally, given the election results in Northern Ireland over the weekend. Senior UK sources emphasised that stability in Northern Ireland was at stake with the glacial pace of talks and while the EU has made clear that its mandate is not set to change. Some cabinet ministers, including the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, were said to be uneasy about the high stakes involved in Truss's strategy and the possibility of a trade war with the EU as the UK stands on the brink of a potential recession. Cabinet sources suggested Truss's manoeuvres were part of 'leadership feather-fluttering' - hinting they were designed to put her at odds with Sunak in the minds of Conservative backbenchers. Sources close to Gove and Sunak denied they were trying to block Truss's plans. The draft bill was initially understood to be intended to grant ministers the power in principle to override the treaty - but not necessarily to be used in practice. However, the Times reported on Tuesday that the bill would go further than expected and scrap parts of the protocol. Such a move is expected to provoke legal retaliation by the EU were it to go ahead - including the bloc potentially imposing new tariffs. Truss will argue that the election results in Northern Ireland give the negotiations a fresh sense of urgency because the Democratic Unionist party has said it will boycott any participation in a new government at Stormont until the issue is resolved. Sinn Fein, which won the most seats at Stormont for the first time, said Northern Ireland was becoming 'collateral damage' in the dispute. Boris Johnson spoke to Ireland's taoiseach, Micheal Martin, on Tuesday morning. No 10 said he underlined the grave situation in Northern Ireland and reiterated warnings about the protocol. 'Despite repeated efforts by the UK government over many months to fix the protocol, including those sections related to the movement of goods and governance, the European Commission had not taken the steps necessary to help address the economic and political disruption on the ground,' No 10 said of the call. 'The prime minister reiterated that the UK government would take action to protect peace and political stability in Northern Ireland if solutions could not be found.' A UK government spokesperson said: 'Our focus has been, and will continue to be, preserving peace and stability in Northern Ireland. No decisions have yet been taken on the way forward. However, the situation is now very serious. 'We have always been clear that action will be taken to protect the Belfast [Good Friday] agreement if solutions cannot be found to fix the protocol.' The Irish deputy prime minister, Leo Varadkar, who reached agreement with Johnson on the protocol in October 2019, suggested the UK was using threats to gain leverage in negotiations. However, he warned the UK could not simply 'resile' from the international treaty by unilaterally tearing up the protocol. 'If that is their approach, then we have a real problem here,' he told RTE. 'It's one thing to engage in a bit of sabre rattling ... but if they were to actually go down that route, it will be very serious.'  Labour's Jenny Chapman, a shadow minister, said the action 'risks a trade war during a cost of living crisis'.", "083a55bd1a07cb6f5cd6a0139fa660cfe192f611b0541f68d8f88ef7": "Beijing has accused Washington of 'political manipulation' and attempting to change the status quo after the US state department quietly amended its website to remove a line stating it did not support Taiwanese independence. In a delicate geopolitical balancing act, the US has long acknowledged, but not supported, China's claim to Taiwan under its version of the 'one China principle'. However, experts say that policy has been eroded as Beijing has become more assertive. In an updated page on the state department's online 'fact sheet' Washington last week removed some key lines from the 1979 US-PRC joint communique. It included a line saying 'the US recognised the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is a part of China'. The line saying the US 'does not support Taiwan independence' - which appeared in a previous version published on 31 August 2018 - has also been removed from the website. The new version said theUS 'continues to encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait differences consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan'. It added: 'The United States has a longstanding one China policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three US-China joint communiques, and the six assurances.' Beijing sees Taiwan as a part of China and has vowed to take it back, with force if necessary. On Tuesday, a spokesperson at the American Institute in Taiwan - the US's de-facto embassy on the island - said Washington's commitment to Taipei was 'rock solid', and that it 'contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region'. On the same day, Beijing criticised the change. A foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, called the edit 'an act of political manipulation and an attempt to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, which will backfire and the US itself will get burned'. The edits took place on 5 May, the state department's website showed. The latest fact sheet on Taiwan begins with the line that 'as a leading democracy and a technological powerhouse, Taiwan is a key US partner in the Indo-Pacific'. The state department also said that the US and Taiwan 'share similar values, deep commercial and economic links, and strong people-to-people ties'. It is not immediately clear if recent changes to the fact sheet reflected the Biden administration's latest policy on China. Anthony Blinken, the secretary of state, was scheduled to deliver a major speech last week laying out the government's framing on China. The activity was cancelled due to Blinken's Covid test results. Tensions between Washington and Beijing over the island of Taiwan have continued to rise since Biden became US president last year. In January, Qin Gang, the Chinese envoy to the US, warned the two countries could face a 'military conflict' over the future of Taiwan, in an unusually explicit reference to the prospect of war.", "68582f3de66a2d72433076496a60c5e4f76e1f7d58f4807948314137": "The Home Office has admitted that lesbian, gay and bisexual refugees could be persecuted if sent to Rwanda - but still plans to fly them 4,000 miles to Kigali. The department's equality impact assessment for the policy states there are 'concerns' over the treatment of some LGBTQI+ people in the east African country, and that investigations point to 'ill treatment' of this group being 'more than one off'. It comes the day after the Home Office said the first group of people would be informed this week of the government's intention to relocate them to Rwanda. The first flights were expected to take place in the coming months, it said, adding that lawyers for some of those affected were likely to launch proceedings to stop their removal. In the report released on Monday, the assessment says 'there are concerns over the treatment of some LGBTQI+ people but we will continue to consider the impact on this group and take into account further evidence over the course of the partnership'. The report notes that homosexuality was decriminalised in 2010, but warns: 'At this stage, investigations point to ill treatment being more than one off, but it does not appear to be systemic.' The government's assessment of Rwanda's human rights record, states that there are 'not substantial grounds' for believing they would be at risk of treatment contrary to article 3 (freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European convention of human rights in Rwanda. At the same time, the Foreign Office travel advice for Rwanda states that 'individuals can experience discrimination and abuse, including from local authorities. There are no specific anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBT individuals.' Lewis Mudge, central Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said the risk assessment was an unrealistic assessment of a country with a poor human rights record. 'The Home Office's report reads like some serious wishful thinking and they seem to change the facts in order to justify a preordained conclusion. From claiming that refugees are not targeted for exercising their freedom of expression - when Congolese refugees rot in jail for protesting their living conditions - to claiming that LGBT people won't risk serious harm in Rwanda - when evidence we've collected has LGBTI people detained, beaten, insulted and harassed for their sexual identity.' 'This report is not grounded in reality. The Rwandan government has an abysmal record when it comes to guaranteeing internationally recognised refugee rights, statues and protocols. It's difficult to imagine a less genuine assessment of Rwanda's shocking human rights record,' he said. In another document released on Monday night, the government said it could send notices of intent to those coming to the UK without authorisation that would warn them they could be sent to Rwanda. A draft letter said: 'I am writing to inform you about how your protection claim is being managed. We have evidence that before you claimed asylum in the United Kingdom, you were present in or had a connection to [name the safe country or countries]. This may have consequences for whether your claim is admitted to the UK asylum system. 'We may also ask Rwanda, another country we consider to be safe, whether it would admit you, under the terms of the migration and economic development partnership between Rwanda and the UK.' Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said letters carrying a threat of Rwanda would prompt many of those waiting for their claims to be processed to disappear and hide from the authorities in the UK. 'The government is failing in its duty of care to people in the asylum system by not recognising the devastating impact the threat of being expelled to Rwanda is having on them. 'The process it is putting in place lacks compassion and demonstrates an inability to see the face behind the case. It shows how this government simply wants to treat vulnerable people who have fled war and oppression as human cargo to be transported thousands of miles away out of sight and out of mind,' he said. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'There is no evidence to substantiate these baseless claims. 'Illegal migrants, including those who crossed the Channel, may be removed and we have the power to detain people ahead of their removal from the UK. 'Only those with inadmissible asylum claims who have made dangerous, unnecessary and illegal journeys will be relocated and to suggest otherwise is wrong.'", "907c25a28a8234d5aed2ff5d182f8d34a1c525aab98a90fd18521b2f": "US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has built a vast digital surveillance system that gives it access to the personal details of almost every person in America, a two-year investigation by Georgetown University law center has found. Researchers from the Center on Privacy & Technology on Tuesday released one of the most comprehensive reviews of Ice activities, concluding that the federal organisation has strayed well beyond its duties as an immigration body to become what is in effect a domestic surveillance agency. Operating largely in secret and with minimal public oversight, Ice has amassed a formidable armory of digital capabilities that allows its agents to 'pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time'. The vast mountain of data to which Ice now has access includes: The Georgetown researchers base their report, American Dragnet: Data-Driven Deportation in the 21st Century, on hundreds of freedom of information requests and a review of more than 100,000 previously unseen Ice spending transactions. The documents reveal the extent to which the agency's surveillance has expanded beyond sharing information with law enforcement agencies to exploiting an array of public and private databases. The agency operates an enormous dragnet of information stored by state and local government, utility companies, social media platforms and private data brokers. The end result is that Ice enjoys almost universal reach, with its intelligence weaponised through the use of powerful algorithmic tools for searching and analysing data. Almost all of that activity, the report points out, is done in the absence of warrants and in secret, beyond the purview of federal and state authorities. The scale of Ice surveillance shocked even the report's authors. 'I was alarmed to discover just how easily federal immigration agents can pull detailed records from the most intimate corners of all our lives,' Nina Wang, a policy associate at the Center on Privacy & Technology and a report author, told the Guardian. She added: 'In its attempts to target an ever-growing number of people for detention and deportation, Ice has reached into the private homes and lives of almost every person in America.' Wang said the immigration agency now had an unfettered ability to 'trace the movement of your vehicle on the roads, look up your address from your water or electricity bills, and conduct face recognition searches on your ID photos, all without needing a search warrant. 'These tactics open massive side doors around existing privacy protections, and many lawmakers still have no idea.' Ice was created in 2003, in the febrile post-9/11 era. Initially it focused on mining the intelligence-gathering potential of the criminal justice system, operating a scheme known as S-Comm in which digital fingerprint data was shared with it by federal, state and local law enforcement. Since then, Ice has increasingly resorted to databases compiled by non-law enforcement entities as a way of widening its dragnet. The Georgetown researchers suggest the motivation was partly to increase the number of deportations of undocumented people and partly as part of the US government's 'larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives'. The center's review of Ice spending from 2008 to last year revealed that overall investment in new surveillance infrastructure increased fivefold from about $71m to $388m. In that period, Ice spent more than $1.3bn on geolocation technology, including contracts with private companies that own license plate scanning databases. A further $96m was spent on biometrics, largely face recognition databases; $97m on private data brokers that gather data on individuals from a range of different sources including more than 80 utility companies; and a staggering $569m on data analysis just to be able to comb through the mammoth quantities of intelligence Ice now had within its grasp. Approximately $189m was paid to Palantir Technologies, the tech company co-founded and chaired by the Trump-supporting billionaire Peter Thiel. The money went towards custom-built programs created by Palantir to allow Ice agents to link public and private databases so that they could, in the center's words, 'visualise an interconnected web of data pulled from nearly every part of an individual's life'. The researchers found a woefully inadequate response from federal and state authorities in terms of privacy protection. Congress, for instance, has yet to hold a full oversight hearing on Ice surveillance. One of the most disturbing aspects of the Ice surveillance system is how it has been used to skirt controls introduced by cities and states and designed to protect communities from precisely these kind of intrusive searches. After many legislatures introduced so-called 'sanctuary' policies that prevented police forces working with Ice agents to facilitate deportations, Ice simply sidestepped the restrictions by finding other channels through which it could acquire intelligence, including through DMVs, private data brokers and utility companies.", "184a9a314f63763671bcfe8eea14db26afa67de8b45ef8c69dcce434": "For decades, South Korea's presidents have begun their terms in office by acquainting themselves with the vast premises of the Blue House. But on Tuesday, Yoon Suk-yeol became the first leader in the country's modern history to shun the presidential residence, heading instead to a new office inside a former defence ministry building in central Seoul. Yoon, who has styled himself as the 'people's president', caused consternation when he said he had no intention of following his predecessors into the Blue House, so named because of the colour of its roof. He said the building, located at the foot of a mountain on a site once used by the Japanese during their 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula, was a 'symbol of imperial power' that would be opened to the public as a sign of his commitment to a more open and democratic presidency. Successive South Korean presidents have lived and worked there since the country became a republic in 1948. The gesture has not been well received, however. His predecessor, Moon Jae-in, criticised the move as hasty and a potential security threat, while even some of his conservative supporters questioned the decision - estimated to have cost $40m - at a time when Yoon should be focusing on the economy and North Korea. Yoon, 61, has been forced to deny that he and his wife had decided to live elsewhere on the advice of shamanistic healers, whose shady role in South Korean politics became an issue during the election campaign. Yoon said the theory had been cooked up by his political opponents to discredit him. 'The Democratic party seems to be more interested in shamans than I am,' he told reporters after his election victory on 9 March, adding that he had considered several locations for his new office and residence. He had come under scrutiny over claims that spiritual advisers introduced by his wife, Kim Kun-hee, had exerted influenced over his campaign. Kim, 49, had told a YouTube channel that she was a 'spiritual person' who preferred meaningful discussions with gurus to visiting nightclubs, according to the Yonhap news agency. Yoon also denied that he had frequented an anal acupuncturist. There was speculation that Yoon was determined to avoid the Blue House 'curse' that had befallen several of his predecessors, including the dictator Park Chung-hee, who was assassinated in the building's grounds in 1979, and his daughter, Park Geun-hye, who was impeached and imprisoned for corruption in 2017. As Yoon was being sworn in on Tuesday, members of the public who had drawn lots to visit the Blue House were divided over his decision. 'It feels surreal,' Hwang Jin-woo, who works for a construction company, told the Guardian outside the building, whose grounds will be turned into a public park. 'Since I was young, this place has been a symbol of power. Until yesterday, it was a symbol of power, but now the public can access it. I was born a few decades ago, at a time when I couldn't even take a glimpse at this place. But suddenly it's been given to the citizens, so it's a little overwhelming.' Lee Jin-ok, who was visiting from Suwon, near Seoul, agreed. 'I think it's really great that it has returned to the arms of the people,' she said. 'It has a lot of cultural value and I have always thought that the Blue House is one of the most beautiful buildings in Korea. I hope people will come here and enjoy themselves while learning about the history of Korea and its past presidents.' But Kim Moon-soo, an office worker, said he was not sure if the millions of dollars used to set up Yoon's new office had been money well spent. 'I think it was a bit of an act to show that he is keeping his promise from day one,' Kim said. 'At the same time, I hope he keeps his other promises and takes good care of the country during these challenging times.'", "ef1d0d745c03bedebf08abee2f95688ff09c47b22fbb470ba7318b42": "Coleen Rooney has accused Rebekah Vardy of conducting a 'deliberate and calculated' campaign to destroy evidence prior to their 'Wagatha Christie' libel trial, which got under way at the high court. Rooney's lawyers claimed potentially important WhatsApp messages involving Vardy had been manually deleted, pointed to an unfortunate incident in which Vardy's agent accidentally dropped her mobile phone off the side of a boat in the North Sea, and discussed how Vardy's own IT expert lost the password to a backup of her WhatsApp account. In written submissions, Rooney's lawyers said these were not a series of 'unfortunate' incidents. Instead, they claimed the loss of data was part of a 'deliberate and calculated' campaign by Vardy and her team to dispose of potentially incriminating evidence - and prevent a fair trial. Vardy's lawyers said the allegation was untrue: 'There is no such campaign of deletion. The reason there is no direct evidence against Mrs Vardy is because she didn't do it.' The two women listened to proceedings while sitting close to each other on the front bench of the wood-panelled Victorian courtroom in central London. Both are expected to give evidence in the coming days, along with other individuals including the former England footballer Wayne Rooney, following almost three years of pre-trial legal arguments. In 2019 Rooney conducted an elaborate sting operation to find out who was leaking stories from her private Instagram account to journalists at the Sun, ultimately making the public accusation that: 'It's............ Rebekah Vardy's account.' Vardy is now suing Rooney for libel, arguing this accusation is false. Following an earlier ruling, it is up to Rooney to prove Vardy was personally responsible for leaking stories to the Sun - or convince the judge that publication of the allegation was in the public interest. In written submissions, Vardy's barrister, Hugh Tomlinson QC, denied his client had personally leaked any stories to the Sun, nor had she approved or condoned 'anyone else to do so on her behalf'. However, in a late change of approach, he suggested it was 'possible' Vardy's agent, Caroline Watt, may have acted unilaterally and passed stories to the Sun without Vardy's knowledge. The court heard Watt is no longer healthy enough to give evidence. Tomlinson insisted that, rather than being the victim of Rooney's sting operation, Vardy was acutely aware that Rooney was posting fake stories in order to see whether anyone would leak them: 'She ... believed that someone was leaking information from Mrs Rooney's private Instagram but didn't know who it was and thought it must be her PR as she couldn't see why anyone would be 'arsed with selling stories on her'.' He said the 'candid' WhatsApp messages previously heard in court between Vardy and Watt showed that 'from time to time they did discuss 'leaking' information to the press'. But only one story - a drink-driving incident involving the Chelsea footballer Danny Drinkwater - was mentioned. Rooney simply 'can't establish that Mrs Vardy was responsible' for the leaks, he said. The lawyer said Vardy had suffered immensely as a result of Rooney's allegation and been 'subjected to abuse and threats of a horrific nature'. He said the term Wagatha Christie had passed into popular culture, with the media covering the court case as an entertainment story when in reality it was 'distressing and disturbing'. In an apparent reference to internet memes, Vardy's lawyer described the spread of 'little photographs that people have done mocking [Rooney] up as Wagatha Christie'. He also gently mocked Rooney's 'belief that what she reads in the Sun is accurate', with regards to an anonymous gossip column about life as a footballer's wife. Rooney's lawyers said an expert technology witness believed the loss of certain WhatsApp messages 'could only have occurred by manual deletion by an individual'. The legal team said this left the 'whiff of cordite' in the air - an apparent reference to a smoking gun. They also highlighted the trouble that Vardy's own IT expert had accessing a backup of her WhatsApp messages. At first the technology adviser said the password he had set no longer worked. Following advice from Rooney's team, the IT expert realised he was in fact able to access the files without a password, but the backup files had apparently become corrupted. Other issues with data recovery raised by Rooney's lawyers included deletion of a Twitter account belonging to Watt, the disposal of a laptop used by Vardy during the crucial period, and the hacking of her husband Jamie Vardy's WhatsApp account, which resulted in the loss of his messages. The case continues.", "8e15e976df59c9152d45af542aa042a692d97fdae25450a56e7011d1": "", "53a41c14743b0d926a8748069d91b85c74edfba2a01eba10fba90e4c": "In a dank, disused railway tunnel in West Sussex hangs a brown, furry parcel, the sole known representative of Britain's rarest mammal. Scientists don't like to apply emotive adjectives to animals, but if ever there were a lonesome creature, it would be this greater mouse-eared bat. The bat's reappearance in December for its 20th winter has astounded its guardians, because of the animal's great age, but also because it was missing, assumed dead, for nearly two years. Since 2002, the bat - the size of a small rabbit, with a wingspan stretching in flight to nearly half a metre - has spent winters clinging to the cool bricks of the tunnel. But it vanished in December 2019 and was missing when members of Sussex Bat Group returned in January and February 2020. Last year, the pandemic prevented a count, so its fate was unknown. 'We assumed it had run its course,' says Tony Hutson, a bat expert and retired entomologist from the Natural History Museum, who discovered the bat. 'But it returned and looked pretty healthy this winter.' Where Britain's rarest mammal spent the pandemic is just one question among many it poses. Each spring, the bat stirs, flaps slowly down the tunnel and vanishes into green woodlands beyond. It remains unseen until the following winter, when it returns to its hibernation roost. Where did it come from? Why is it here? Why is it alone? And can it be helped? When it was declared extinct in 1992, the greater mouse-eared bat, Myotis myotis, was the first land mammal to disappear from Britain since the wolf, about 250 years ago. Most bats zigzag through the sky collecting insects, but this species descends earthwards, swooping upon grasshoppers, crickets and dung beetles. Often, it will flop on to the ground, wings outstretched to fold over its prey. There were never many of these bats in Britain. When a colony was discovered in 1957 in the Isle of Purbeck, a peninsula in Dorset, it caused a sensation. Photos were published in the Times and several animals were prodded out of hibernation to be filmed in TV studios. Disturbing the bats mid-hibernation probably killed some of them. Others were spirited away by collectors. The species was barely seen again. Hutson is not the original champion of Britain's greater mouse-eared bats. The first was a tea planter from Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) called William Watt Addison Phillips, who retired to Bognor Regis in West Sussex in 1959, shortly after the frenzy in Dorset. While exploring dilapidated tunnels with his grandson, Phillips discovered a small colony of the bats. He proceeded to shoot a couple for donation to the Natural History Museum. When Hutson discovered the bat in 2002, he hoped this young male would lead them to a secret colony. But a media appeal brought no sightings. He scoured chalk mines and disused lime kilns. An attempt to extract DNA from bat hair, to identify the individual's origins, failed. He considered putting a VHF radio tag on the animal, but feared the imposition could kill it. In 2007, the bat was taken carefully from the wall for a short inspection. It was in good health, but very much alone: its genitals showed it had never been sexually active. In March 2018, I accompanied Hutson into the tunnel to meet Britain's loneliest bat. It is difficult to bond with anyone who is deeply asleep, head tucked out of sight, but it was a small, tranquil being (and a paler brown than I had imagined). When the Irish playwright Barry McStay read the Guardian article I wrote about the bat, it inspired him to write Vespertilio, a play about Alan, a devoted conservationist guarding a rare bat. The middle-aged bat lover meets a young homeless runaway and the unfolding fiction explores loneliness within the gay community, love, deceit and redemption. The critically acclaimed play opened in London in 2019 in the apposite surroundings of a disused railway tunnel beneath Waterloo station. Later that year, the bat disappeared. Now that it has reappeared, there are calls to solve the riddle of its existence. 'When it first turned up, I thought it was a pioneer and there were others around, but now I think it's just a stray that got over here from the continent somehow and hung on,' says Hutson. The Sussex Bat Group volunteers have done all they can, but Fiona Mathews, a professor of environmental biology at the University of Sussex, suggests professional conservationists should take action. She is calling on Natural England, the UK government's adviser for the protection of nature, to investigate whether more greater mouse-eared bats are living undetected in Britain. Genetic identification of bat droppings found in large roof spaces where the species could roost could reveal individuals secreted away - in the roof of a stately home, for instance. 'This individual bat is getting quite geriatric now. It's a fascinating thing, but I keep turning over in my head what could be done. Why aren't we doing more about this?' says Matthews. In mainland Europe, the species thrives around vineyards, which provide bare ground where it can easily find prey. Perhaps the proliferation of wine-making in Sussex could boost this impossibly uncommon bat in Britain. 'Given that we think Britain is going to become more suitable for the species with climate change, why don't we have a recovery programme for the greater mouse-eared bat?' asks Matthews. 'We know this species is losing its range in southern Europe. They will probably need to move north for their survival. They are in northern France, which is not that different and not that far away. Maybe they just need a helping hand across the Channel.' Wild Green Wonders: A Life in Nature by Patrick Barkham is out now (Guardian Faber, PS14.99).

Natural gas has long been touted as a 'transition' fuel for economies dependent on coal for their power needs, as it has lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal but requires similar centralised infrastructure, and gas-fired power stations take only a couple of years to build. Earlier this year, before Russia invaded Ukraine, the European Commission angered green campaigners by including gas as a 'bridge' to clean energy in its guidebook for green investment. High prices for gas, and the plummeting cost of renewable energies such as wind and solar power, have reversed that logic, according to analysis from TransitionZero. The cost of switching from coal to renewable energy has plunged by 99% since 2010, according to its report published on Tuesday. The findings call into question the economic viability of the scores of gas and coal-fired power plants that are planned or under construction around the world. About 615GW of new gas plants, and 442GW of new coal-fired power stations, are planned for construction globally, according to the analysis. Matt Gray, the co-founder of TransitionZero, said it no longer made sense to think of gas as a transition fuel, and countries should opt for renewables in place of coal. 'Despite some regional variation, our analysis shows a clear deflationary trend in the cost of switching from coal to clean electricity,' he said. 'Independent of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, this trend will accelerate, presenting governments with an economic opportunity to protect electricity consumers from continued fossil fuel volatility.' Many countries are reviewing their energy policies in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine - which has sent fossil fuel prices soaring and disrupted supplies - and may be considering a reversion to coal. The amount of power generated from coal rose 9% to a record high last year, even before the war in Ukraine, and if the coal-fired power stations now planned are built the world will have little chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C, according to separate analysis published last month. Gray said that although the economics were firmly in favour of renewable energy, governments must make some policy changes in order to realise the full benefits. These included making it easier to build windfarms and solar power, because acquiring planning permission can take up to 10 years in some regions; removing distorting incentives and tax breaks for fossil fuels; and ensuring electricity markets are properly functioning. The analysis also found that the economics of moving from coal power to renewable energy, without using gas, were most favourable in Europe, where the price of coal has increased, in part because of EU policies and also because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In China and the US, however, domestically produced coal is cheaper than in Europe. Despite the lower price of renewables, China is still planning new coal-fired power stations, and the US could increase its coal use in response to higher demand for gas. In Japan, the price of switching from coal to renewables is higher still, because of 'discriminatory regulations and land-use constraints', and in south-east Asia some countries subsidise coal and gas, distorting the economics of a switch to clean power.", "6c1240ea59d4e541ca32c22d429a967319c0954261702e0f403e9a16": "Doctors have stressed the importance of Covid vaccinations for pregnant women after a major review found the shots were not only safe, but reduced the risk of stillbirth by 15%. Researchers at St George's, University of London, and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists analysed 23 published studies and trials that enrolled 117,552 pregnant women vaccinated against Covid, to assess the safety of the shots. The vast majority of the women received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, which provided 89.5% protection against Covid infection seven days after the second dose. There was no evidence of greater risk from miscarriage, preterm birth or other pregnancy complications. 'We wanted to see if vaccination was safe or not for pregnant women,' said Asma Khalil, professor of obstetrics and maternal fetal medicine at St George's hospital in London. 'It is safe, but what's surprising, and it's a positive finding, is that there was a reduction in stillbirths.' 'So far, most of the data on vaccines in pregnancy have been about protecting the pregnant woman herself from Covid. Now we have evidence that the vaccines protect the baby too,' she added. The results are published in Nature Communications. Almost all pregnant women admitted to UK hospitals for Covid treatment are unvaccinated. And while vaccine uptake among pregnant women rose from 23% in August to 54% at the end of last year, doctors believe thousands are still unvaccinated. In December, the UK government's vaccine watchdog, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, made pregnant women a priority group for jabs after studies found women were more likely to become seriously ill if they caught Covid while pregnant. The infection is also linked to a greater risk of stillbirth and preterm birth. The vaccines appear to reduce the risk of stillbirth by protecting against severe disease, but the study found only hints that the vaccine reduced preterm births, too. 'The best way to protect pregnant women and their babies is to get the Covid vaccine,' Khalil said. 'Even if a pregnant woman thinks they will be fine if they get Covid, that it will be mild for them, there's a potential advantage for the baby.' Edward Morris, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said the paper provided further reassurance that Covid vaccination was safe in pregnancy. 'We know women have been hesitant about having the vaccine due to concerns over the effect on their baby. We now have strong evidence to show that the vaccine does not increase the risk of adverse outcomes and is the best way of protecting both women and their babies. 'We would recommend all pregnant women have the Covid-19 vaccine and the booster vaccine. Covid-19 is still prevalent and if you do get the virus when you're pregnant then you are at higher risk of severe illness.'", "fd78aebcbae42c9be422ad2f33d08e735fda15a67659316c206b4c40": "A former Facebook moderator has filed a lawsuit against its owner, Meta Platforms, alleging poor working conditions for contracted content moderators violate the Kenyan constitution. The petition, also filed against Meta's local outsourcing company Sama, alleges that workers moderating Facebook posts in Kenya have been subjected to unreasonable working conditions including irregular pay, inadequate mental health support, union-busting, and violations of their privacy and dignity. The lawsuit, filed by one person on behalf of a group, seeks financial compensation, an order that outsourced moderators get the same health care and pay scale as Meta employees, that unionisation rights be protected, and an independent human rights audit of the office. A Meta spokesperson told Reuters: 'We take our responsibility to the people who review content for Meta seriously and require our partners to provide industry-leading pay, benefits and support. We also encourage content reviewers to raise issues when they become aware of them and regularly conduct independent audits to ensure our partners are meeting the high standards we expect.' Sama declined to comment before seeing the lawsuit but has previously rejected claims that its employees were paid unfairly, that the recruitment process was opaque, or that its mental health benefits were inadequate. The lawsuit's specific requests for action are more granular and wide-ranging than those sought in previous cases and could reverberate beyond Kenya. 'This could have ripple effects. Facebook is going to have to reveal a lot about how they run their moderation operation,' said Odanga Madung, a fellow at the Mozilla Foundation, a US-based global nonprofit dedicated to internet rights. Globally, thousands of moderators review social media posts that could depict violence, nudity, racism or other offensive content. Many work for third-party contractors rather than tech companies. Meta has already faced scrutiny over content moderators' working conditions. Last year, a California judge approved an $85m settlement between Facebook and more than 10,000 content moderators who had accused the company of failing to protect them from psychological injuries resulting from their exposure to graphic and violent imagery. Facebook did not admit wrongdoing in the California case but agreed to take measures to provide its content moderators, who are employed by third-party vendors, with safer work environments. The Kenyan lawsuit was filed on behalf of Daniel Motaung, who was recruited in 2019 from South Africa to work for Sama in Nairobi. Motaung says he was not given details about the nature of the work reviewing Facebook posts before his arrival. The first video Motaung remembers moderating was of a beheading. He says his pay and mental health support were inadequate to cope with the disturbing content. 'I have been diagnosed with severe PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder),' Motaung told Reuters. 'I am living ... a horror movie.' Motaung's lawyers said that Meta and Sama created a dangerous and degrading environment where workers were not given the same protections as employees in other countries. 'If in Dublin people can't look at harmful content for two hours, that should be the rule everywhere,' Motaung's lawyer Mercy Mutemi said. 'If they need to have a psychologist on call, that should apply everywhere.' Shortly after joining Sama, Motaung tried to form a union to advocate for the company's roughly 200 workers in Nairobi. He was fired soon after, which he and his lawyers say was because of the unionisation attempt. Union rights are enshrined in the Kenyan constitution. Sama has not commented on this allegation. Motaung's experience was first revealed in an investigation published by Time magazine in February.

Sponsored by the Republican Texas senator John Cornyn and the Democratic Delaware senator Chris Coons, the Supreme Court Police Parity Act passed on Monday unanimously and without objection. The bipartisan bill now advances to the House for consideration and, if approved, would head to Joe Biden's desk for the president's signature. Cornyn and Coons's bill generally aims to provide supreme court justices and their immediate relatives with security that is equivalent to what is granted to members of the federal government's legislative and executive branches. It came after the 2 May leak of a draft opinion which showed five conservatives on the nine-justice court had voted to reverse Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision which in effect made abortion legal nationwide. Conservatives celebrated the leak, which seemingly left Roe v Wade poised to fall in the summer. But liberals protested against it, and some activists gathered outside the Maryland homes of the chief justice, John Roberts, and his fellow conservative associate Brett Kavanaugh to make their displeasure known. The demonstrations outside the homes of Roberts and Kavanaugh were peaceful. Nonetheless, in a statement on Monday, the US Marshals Service confirmed the agency was assisting the supreme court with 'increased security concerns stemming from the unauthorized release of the draft opinion'. Coons, in a separate statement ahead of the bill's passage on Monday, added: 'The events of the past week have intensified the focus on supreme court justices' families, who are unfortunately facing threats to their safety in today's increasingly polarized political climate. We must act to ensure justices and their families are protected from those who wish to cause them harm by extending supreme court police security to family members.' Coons added that relatives of the high court's justices essentially 'have the same profile and exposure as the highest-ranking officials in our government,' making them equally deserving of protection. As for the White House, the press secretary, Jen Psaki, issued a statement on Monday on Twitter admonishing protesters to 'never include violence, threats or vandalism' as part of their demonstrations. 'Judges perform an incredibly important function in our society, and they must be able to do their jobs without concern for their personal safety,' Psaki said. The bill from Cornyn and Coons was not the only measure taken to beef up security around the supreme court's justices. Crews also installed an 8ft-tall fence that is purportedly non-scalable around parts of the supreme court's building, and they erected concrete barriers blocking the street in front of the complex.", "e264a8fcb04fb7a79ad8adee0dda750d09f926afee7e769c446651f2": "Peloton's share price crashed 20% in early trading after the exercise bike maker missed revenue targets, cut sales guidance and reported a bigger quarterly loss than anticipated, and its boss described turning the company around as 'emotionally draining'. Peloton, whose market value has fallen by more than 80% over the last year, reported revenues of $964m (PS780m), down from $1.26bn in the same quarter last year, as the pandemic-enforced trend for home workouts that fuelled a surge in sales of its hi-tech, internet-connected exercise bikes peters out. The company, which missed analyst revenue estimates by about $6m in its fiscal third quarter to the end of March, reported a loss of $757m. 'Turnarounds are hard work,' the chief executive, Barry McCarthy, who took over from the co-founder John Foley in February, said in a letter to shareholders. 'It's intellectually challenging, emotionally draining, physically exhausting, and all-consuming. It's a full-contact sport.' In January, Peloton said in a message to its 3,200 staff that it needed to 'evaluate' its workforce, subsequently cutting thousands of jobs, and indicated it needed to implement production curbs because of a slump in demand. 'The balance sheet challenge has been managing inventory,' said McCarthy, a former chief financial officer at Spotify and Netflix. 'We have too much for the current run rate of the business, and that inventory has consumed an enormous amount of cash, more than we expected, which has caused us to rethink our capital structure. Fortunately the obsolescence risk on this is negligible, and we believe the inventory will sell eventually. So this is primarily a cashflow timing issue, not a structural issue.' Peloton said it expected to report revenues of $675m to $700m in its fourth quarter, well below analysts' average estimate of $820.9m. The company said this was due to 'softer demand' compared with its previous guidance, and recent hardware price reductions. Peloton said the number of members grew 5% quarter-on-quarter to 7 million, with the number of workouts during the quarter growing by almost a third to 184.3m. The company, which is implementing a price increase to its monthly subscription fee from 1 June, said it had only experienced a 'modest' customer churn rate so far this year. It said it had signed a deal with JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs to borrow $750m in five-year term debt. Peloton has said it is not seeking a sale, but reports suggested the company may look to sell a stake of as much as 20% of the business to an outside investor to accelerate its turnaround strategy.", "e44235fd5a76a0d3a0ff55a4087c963b630143b05c5bf69b24610bf7": "The president is due to speak shortly about the administration's efforts to reduce inflation. But a significant chunk of the remarks are expected to highlight a plan by Senator Rick Scott, a Republican of Florida, that would increase the federal income taxes for many Americans.  A White House statement on Tuesday said: Congressional Republicans, led by Senator Rick Scott, have called for a new minimum tax on the middle class - firefighters and teachers - that would mean an average of almost $1,500 less in families' pockets each year. And, while part of President Biden's plan to lower costs is to strengthen Medicare by giving it the power to negotiate prescription drug prices, the Congressional Republican plan would put Medicare - in addition to Social Security, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and other critical programs for American families - on the chopping block every five years. However, few Republicans have embraced the plan and many have denounced it. Inflation is a top concern for many voters, and Republicans are confident that blaming Democrats for rising costs is a winning message ahead of the 2022 midterms. In response, the White House and Democrats have seized on Scott's 11-point plan to make the case that Republicans, not Democrats, want to raise taxes on Americans.  Ahead of the president's remarks, Scott, who is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has issued a blistering statement calling Biden 'unwell' and 'unfit for office'. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said ending the constitutional right to an abortion would have 'very damaging' effect on the economy and women's earning potential.  Testifying before the Senate banking committee this morning, Yellen was asked by Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat of New Jersey, what the loss of abortion access would mean for women economically. Senator Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, pushed back on Yellen's assertion that the loss of abortion access will hurt women economically, bolstered by years of research, calling it 'callous' and 'harsh.' 'It means children will grow up in poverty,' she replied.  As the White House prepares to convene a Covid-19 summit this week, former heads of state, dignitaries and Nobel laureates are urging Biden to do more to lead the world's response to the virus and improve preparedness for a future pandemic.  According to the New York Times, the group are calling on the US to commit $5bn to combat the virus globally.  'I want America to recognize that the disease is not over anywhere until it's over everywhere,' former British prime minister Gordon Brown told the New York Times in an interview.  But as we explained earlier, the White House's request for additional resources to buy more tests, vaccines and therapeutics is being held up in Congress over Republican opposition to a decision by the administration to lift a pandemic-era immigration rule. On Monday, Biden said it a statement that he supported the decision to decouple coronavirus funding from an aid package for Ukraine, leaving the fate of the former uncertain. 'Let me be clear,' Biden said in the statement, 'as vital as it is to help Ukraine combat Russian aggression, it is equally vital to help Americans combat Covid. Biden told lawmakers that a failure to approve additional funding would hurt both domestic and international efforts to beat back the pandemic.  Biden has requested $22.5bn in emergency coronavirus aid, including $5bn for the global response to the pandemic. The virtual summit on Thursday will be hosted jointly by Belize, Germany, Indonesia and Senegal. Lawmakers on Tuesday are set to begin debating a nearly $40bn aid package, an extraordinary sum that exceeds the $33bn Biden requested of Congress.  An agreement was reached among Congressional leaders to swiftly send the aid to Biden's desk, after Democrats untangled the package from a separate request for coronavirus funding.  'We cannot afford delay in this vital war effort,' Biden said in a statement on Monday. '. Hence, I am prepared to accept that these two measures move separately, so that the Ukrainian aid bill can get to my desk right away.' He urged Congress to send the package to him 'in the next few days.' As lawmakers discuss the aid, Ukraine Ambassador Oksana Markarova will be on the Hill to speak at the caucus lunches, according to The Hill. It comes after Biden on Monday signed a bill into law that will expedite the shipment of military aid and equipment to Ukraine and other allies in Eastern Europe.  While the agreement paves the way for additional aid to Ukraine, the fate of billions of dollars in funding for coronavirus vaccines, testing and therapeutics remains uncertain.  With the supreme court poised to end the constitutional right to an abortion, Democrats are under increasing pressure to fulfill their promises to protect reproductive choice. On Wednesday, they will hold a vote in the Senate on legislation that would codify the landmark supreme court decision Roe v Wade into federal law. But the bill is doomed to fail amid Republican opposition. And when it does, Democrats are not planning to hold a vote to modify or end the Senate filibuster, according to the Washington Post.  That is not particularly surprising or new.  For months, activists have been demanding Democrats amend or eliminate the filibuster, the parliamentary procedure requiring 60 votes to move forward with most legislation, to pass measures they believe are critical on voting rights, immigration and, now, abortion rights. But Democrats lack the votes to do so in the evenly divided Senate and the revelation that the supreme court intends to strike down Roe hasn't changed the calculus.  But that hasn't stopped some progressive Democrats from trying. According to the Post, a group of 114 House Democrats, led by Illinois congressman Sean Casten, California congresswomen Judy Chu and Barbara Lee,  Missouri congresswoman Cori Bush and Colorado congresswoman Diana DeGette, sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer demanding he hold a vote to scrap the filibuster. 'When voters gave Democrats control of the House, Senate, and the White House, they did so with the expectation that we would legislate boldly and do what is necessary to advance our fight for justice and economic prosperity. Now more than ever it is the time to deliver on our promises,' the letter states. 'The Senate must meet the moment, end the filibuster, and pass the Women's Health Protection Act (WHPA) immediately.' Schumer almost certainly won't hold such a vote. Two Democratic senators - Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia - publicly oppose such a move, leaving the party at least two votes shy of enacting the change.  Good morning. It's another busy day in Washington DC, as the president and lawmakers on Capitol Hill scramble to respond to some of the most urgent issues of the day - rising inflation, the anticipated demise of Roe v Wade, the war in Ukraine and the pandemic.  From the White House, Joe Biden will deliver remarks on the administration's efforts to combat inflation at 11.30am. He will attempt to draw a sharp contrast with what the White House is calling 'Congressional Republicans' ultra-Maga plan to raise taxes on 75 million American families and threaten to sunset programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid'. Later in the day, the US president will hold a bilateral meeting with the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi. Jen Psaki, in her last week as press secretary, will brief reporters at 2.30pm ET.  Expect lots of wheeling and dealing on Capitol Hill, where Democrats and Republicans in both chambers are hoping to push through a massive aid bill for Ukraine. The swift action comes after Biden gave his blessing for decoupling the Ukraine aid from a Covid preparedness funding bill that Republicans oppose. This makes the road to passing any sort of Covid funding much more precarious. At the same time, Democrats are preparing to hold a doomed vote on legislation that would codify the constitutional right to abortion into federal law. A vote is expected tomorrow.  And it's another primary day. This Tuesday, it's West Virginia and Nebraska holding elections that offer another test of former president Donald Trump's influence within the Republican party.

Amal became an international symbol of displacement and loss - but also of compassion and generosity - when, with a team of puppeteers and support workers, she walked from Gaziantep near the Turkish-Syrian border to Manchester between July and October. This week the 3.5-metre puppet will visit the Polish cities of Lublin and Krakow to meet Ukrainian refugee children and families who have left their homes since Russia launched its military offensive on 20 February. Amir Nizar Zuabi, the artistic director of The Walk, Amal's trans-European journey, said: 'At a time of unprecedented global change, Amal's journeys transcend borders, politics and language to tell a new story of shared humanity - and to ensure the world doesn't forget the millions of displaced children, each with their own potential to enhance the communities in which, as we hope, they will find refuge.' The Polish trip, which includes visiting Przemysl, a town close to the border with Ukraine, is at the invitation of the mayors of Lublin and Krakow and the Ukrainian embassy in Poland. Amal and her crew have taken with them aid and supplies aimed at the needs of young children. Aleksander Sola, the vice-president of the Folkowisko Foundation, which is supporting the trip, said: 'We hope that Amal will draw the world's attention to the refugee crisis that Europe has not seen since the end of world war two. Amal symbolises the millions of refugees who have been forced to leave their homes.' Amal, whose name means hope in Arabic, was created by Handspring, the company that made the equine puppets in War Horse. Three puppeteers are needed to operate Amal.", "fade7dba788faf2c490a3047c4b3a603fdd662217ba27afa9eb85deb": "Tensions between Shanghai residents and China's Covid enforcers are on the rise again, amid a new push to end infections outside quarantine zones to meet President Xi Jinping's demand for achieving 'dynamic zero-Covid'. Videos shared on China's social media platforms showed suspected Covid-positive patients forcibly quarantined in central facilities. In some neighbourhoods a single positive case could lead to residents in the entire apartment building be sent for quarantine. Censors have been taking down many of these videos, but determined residents have continued to post them. Past speeches by top officials and legal scholars have resurfaced in which they speak of the importance of the rule of law. These speeches have been shared and reposted on social media to express disapproval of government policy. Last week, Xi reiterated that his government had no intention of turning away from the controversial zero-Covid commitment, in a major speech to the country's senior cadres. He urged officials to 'unswervingly adhere to the general policy of dynamic zero-Covid' and warned against any criticism or doubting of the policy. Over the weekend, residents in at least four of Shanghai's 16 districts reported receiving notices that told them they would no longer be able to receive food deliveries or leave their homes, prompting numerous complaints on social media. 'The virus itself is no longer scary, but the way the government enforced the policy has become the most frightening thing,' said one Shanghai resident, who wished to remain anonymous. 'We had thought the lockdown could be eased this month, but now there's no end in sight again.' In the past few days, a number of videos shared on social media showed that health officials - also called Dabai, or 'Big Whites' due to their white hazmat suits - entered residents' homes and sprayed disinfectants everywhere. This practice outraged many residents, who questioned the legality. Others asked whether such a measure had any scientific basis. In one viral video, hazmat-suited enforcement officers ordered residents to be quarantined after a neighbour tested positive. 'It's not that you can do whatever you want - unless you're in America. This is China,' one of the officers is heard saying. 'Stop asking me why, there is no why. We have to adhere to national guidelines.' The Guardian does not know the identities of the residents and whether they were eventually taken away. Not all Shanghai residents were compliant. In a separate video, a local resident addressed government health workers to abide by China's law. The middle-aged man, clad in a red protective suit with a face mask and a face shield, pointed out that there was always a limit to the power government officials are entitled to, and citizens' rights should not be abused. 'Let me tell you,' the man said, 'you can only use your power with the authorisation of law ... You have to tell me which items in our country's law allowed you to carry out your public power today? ... Therefore, you cannot enforce hard isolation [upon us].' It is not the first time that the government's enforcement of zero-Covid has led to tensions in Shanghai, home to 25 million people and a key financial hub in Asia. In April, residents in Pudong - the eastern part of the city - scuffled with hazmat-suited police who were forcing them to surrender their homes to become coronavirus quarantine facilities. Worried about Covid-prevention excesses, legal scholars have voiced their concerns. On Sunday, a long appeal letter urging the government to abide by China's constitution was widely shared on social media. Censors took down the article multiple times but many determined residents continued to post it. The lead author of the letter, Prof Tong Zhiwei at Shanghai's East China University of Political Science and Law, said the restrictions and the way the authorities enforced them could lead to 'some kind of legal disaster'. 'Pandemic prevention needs to be balanced with ensuring people's rights and freedoms,' Tong wrote. 'Local governments and officials need to stick to the constitution and laws, and cannot destroy the rule of law for convenience.' Guobin Yang, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of the book The Wuhan Lockdown, said: 'Like what we've seen in Wuhan in 2020 when the virus first emerged, citizens are protesting against the government's blunt enforcement of lockdowns. Shanghai has taken this dynamic to a new level, but we still don't know how the government will respond in the end.' Shanghai is in its sixth week of lockdown. Case numbers have been decreasing, according to local health officials. On Monday, Shanghai reported 322 locally transmitted Covid cases, 3,625 local asymptomatic infections, and 11 deaths for the previous 24 hours. It was a continued drop in new cases for the 10th straight day. It is not just Shanghai that has been under some form of restrictions. In Beijing, where daily case numbers are far below Shanghai's at this point in its outbreak, the government has asked residents to work from home. Dozens of bus routes and almost 15% of the Chinese capital's sprawling subway system have been suspended.", "0236b3d90c7f9278ecf9c892f317a3120bc37b463a73e719b09b2e8a": "Grindr plans to float through a merger with a so-called Spac investment company in a deal that values the gay dating app at $2.1bn (PS1.7bn). The app will receive $384m as part of the deal with Tiga Acquisition Corp (TAC), the Singapore-based special purpose acquisition company (Spac) - also known as a 'blank cheque' shell company that raises money first and seeks businesses to buy later. Grindr, which launched in 2009 and specialises in dating among the LGBTQ+ community, had 10.8 million monthly active users last year. Of these 723,000 paid for one of its subscription services, called Xtra and Unlimited, with paying users up 31% over 2020. The average amount of time users spend on the app each day hit 61 minutes in December and 80% of profiles on Grindr are 35 years old or younger - with just 11% aged 41 or older - according to the company's investor presentation. The company's revenues rose 30% last year to $147m - and it expects growth of between 35% and 40% this year - and made $77m in adjusted profits. The valuation is more than triple the $608m that owner San Vicente Acquisition paid for Grindr two years ago. Grindr said that as part of the deal, which will result in existing shareholders owning about 78% of the company, the chief executive, Jeff Bonforte, would step down. 'It has been the longstanding goal of Grindr's current ownership and management that Grindr be led by members of the LGBTQ+ community,' the company said in a statement announcing the deal. 'Working together, Grindr's board and management have identified and been in discussions with a potential new chief executive officer candidate who would bring a depth and breadth of experience across technology, finance, and management, including time spent in an executive leadership role at a public company.' Grindr, which is based in West Hollywood, California, and Tiga said the deal may require clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets deals for potential national security risks. In 2019, CFIUS ordered the Chinese gaming company Kunlun Tech Co, then owner of Grindr, to sell the company over concerns that personal data of US users could be accessed and used by China's government. The company sold Grindr a year later for $608m. The deal means Grindr will join the much larger $20bn Match group, which owns dating brands including Tinder and Hinge and has about 100 million users in total, and Bumble, which has about 40 million users, as publicly listed dating apps.", "787a16e9b7872d887ef74e4deedbfb6d4c746dd666bde956b6fe37a6": "Stanford University said it found a noose hanging from a tree outside a residence hall and is investigating the incident as a hate crime.

'We cannot state strongly enough that a noose is a reprehensible symbol of anti-Black racism and violence that will not be tolerated on our campus,' said the email from the vice-provosts Susie Brubaker-Cole and Patrick Dunkley.

The Guardian speaks to a woman imprisoned for setting fire to a cushion and a prison officer running a unit for the sickest prisoners. Shell Ball cannot remember exactly what was going through her head when she set fire to a cushion in her home in Crewe in 2019. But she had been struggling to cope with the death of her fiance, Gary, who had started drinking heavily again after they lost a baby. 'I got quite drunk and I really don't know why but I set fire to the corner of a cushion. Upstairs had heard me shouting and called the police,' she said. It was the start of a nightmare that would result in Ball - who has been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, PTSD and borderline personality disorder - being imprisoned and then twice recalled to prison after attempting to take her own life. In total she would spend nearly a year and a half behind bars and lose custody of her youngest son - all for setting fire to a cushion, as a cry for help. Ball, 38, was held in a police station over that fateful weekend, charged with reckless arson. The following Monday she went to court and was remanded in HMP Styal, Cheshire - just a week after Gary had died. Ball was inconsolable. 'I cried for two weeks. I just couldn't stop crying. My world had fallen apart and now I was in prison,' she said. When her case was heard she wrote a heartfelt letter to the judge explaining what had happened in her life, from being raped as a teenager to losing a child and a partner - but she was still sent back to prison. '[The judge] said: 'I know you didn't have any intention of hurting anyone that night other than yourself,' but he gave me two years.' Ball started self-harming as it gave her 'some release' from the hopelessness of her situation. 'There's no light at the end of the tunnel. A lot of people in prison are the same and that's why people kill themselves and self-harm,' she said. While she was at Styal, at least one woman died. 'About 90% of the women in there had mental health issues - most probably that's why they were in there in the first place,' she said. The prison put her on a plan for those at risk of self-harm and suicide. But she was only given the opportunity to speak to a psychiatrist on the phone just before she was released. 'It was pointless.' She struggled to cope outside as she had not received any sustained treatment in prison and was recalled after two suicide attempts. Ball appealed to the Parole Board but was turned down: 'How can I get recalled for trying to take my own life? How's that criminal?' Ball was eventually released in August 2021 and has been getting her life back together. But she believes she should never have been sent to prison: 'I don't see myself as a criminal. I wanted to hurt myself. I wanted to die. I should have been sectioned in hospital and got the help I needed, which would have caused a lot less pain.' 'A lot of officers avoid coming on to this [mental health] unit because they class it as the most dangerous part of the prison. You could open a door one day and the man in front of you could be nice as pie. You could open the door an hour later and he'd come out swinging punches. 'Self-harm is quite high. We don't allow them to have razors or any sharp objects. But that doesn't stop people. We've had people rip wall tiles off the showers and self-harm with them. We had a guy who tried to cut his own jugular a few months back. 'We see it as containment rather than any form of treatment. We keep them locked in mostly. We do let them out for a bit of association and we do take them outside for exercise. But on hospital wards they are out all day. It's a much more relaxed environment. There are nurses to medicate them. 'In prisons, we can't always give them the same medication they were prescribed in the community because certain drugs aren't allowed within prison walls. Opioid-based medications are banned because they become currency. 'A lot of these people end up in prison due to their mental health. I'm looking at my board at the moment: from the eight that I've got in the unit today, there's only one that I would say doesn't fall into that category. There's one in for carrying a bladed article. Another for harassment. He stood in the street shouting. He has psychosis and hears voices. Another person attacked a neighbour because he was playing music too loud. And a lot of these are under care in the community anyway, even before they come to us. They are ill. It is inhumane [to put them in prison].'

'Starmer accused of piling pressure on police,' the paper's front-page headline said on Tuesday, directly below a red banner saying, 'Beergate: Day 13', a tally of how many days, some might argue, the paper has been trying to persuade Starmer to do exactly what he has now done. The Labour leader's decision to pledge that he would resign if issued with a penalty over an April campaign event in Durham last year, where he was pictured holding a beer, 'placed detectives in the difficult position' of knowing their decision would have major political ramifications, the Mail story warned. One unnamed government source said 'ministers were concerned that Sir Keir's intervention could place 'undue pressure' on Durham Constabulary to clear Sir Keir, or at least refrain from fining him'. A separate editorial comment from the paper said, in typically steadfast style, that Starmer's televised statement announcing the decision 'combined lawyerly weasel words with trademark sanctimony'. In a section that seemingly hints at a lack of contact between those writing the editorials and the team in charge of news, the comment added: 'Superficially of course, he appears to be doing the decent thing, though frankly, he didn't have much choice.' The lack of choice would arguably be the message regular readers would have taken from the 13 days - and counting - of Mail coverage about 'beergate'. One front page, on 30 April, boomed: 'Police told to investigate Labour's lies.' A series of other similar front pages urged Durham police to look again at an incident that they had concluded in February had broken no Covid rules, and then explained at length how untenable Starmer's position would be if the force changed its mind. Other stories have detailed what the paper insists are inconsistencies in Labour's narrative about the evening in question, and reasons why it demonstrably broke guidelines in place at the time. It is, of course, now a matter for Durham police, who have some experience in politically charged Covid investigations, having decided to take no action against Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson's then-chief adviser, for his ill-advised drives through their territory in the peak of lockdown. No one, beyond perhaps a handful of experienced detectives, knows what they will decide.

Video footage released by Russian news agencies showed Sergey Andreev and several other men with paint on their clothes and faces surrounded by a crowd, some holding Ukrainian flags. In other videos of the incident circulating online, anti-war activists can be heard chanting 'fascists' and 'murderers'. Andreev told the Russian news agency Tass that he and his team had not been seriously hurt in the incident. The protesters prevented the ambassador from laying flowers at the cemetery and Polish police escorted him away. Russia's foreign ministry responded to the incident by demanding Warsaw organise a new wreath-laying ceremony immediately and saying Poland should 'ensure complete protection against any provocations'. The war in Ukraine has overshadowed this year's Victory Day when Russia remembers the 27 million Soviet citizens who lost their lives in the second world war. Poland, which has taken in millions of Ukrainian refugees, cancelled all official commemorations of the anniversary. Speaking during a trip to Iran, the Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, said: 'It is an incident that should not have happened, an incident that is, by all means, regrettable.' He said diplomats enjoyed special protection regardless of the policies pursued by the authorities of their countries. The Polish interior minister, Mariusz Kaminski, tweeted: 'The gathering of opponents of Russian aggression against Ukraine, where genocide takes place every day, was legal. The emotions of Ukrainian women participating in the demonstration, whose husbands courageously fight for the defence of the Motherland, are understandable. 'The Polish authorities did not recommend the Russian ambassador to lay flowers on 9 May in Warsaw. The police allowed the ambassador to safely leave the scene.' The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the 'admirers of neo-Nazism have again shown their faces', repeating Kremlin claims that Russia is fighting fascists in Ukraine. The incident is likely to further raise tensions between Moscow and Warsaw, with Poland emerging as a key arms supply route in the Ukraine war. Russian officials have claimed without evidence that Poland aspires to annex the western regions of Ukraine, and Warsaw refused earlier this month to pay the Russian energy giant Gazprom in roubles, leading to a halt in gas supplies to the country.", "4f4a6bcdf5b3d2a288388385e61176342ced774cd9eb62016619e305": "The Pulitzer prizes have honoured the journalists of Ukraine with a special citation hailing the country's reporters for the 'courage, endurance and commitment to truthful reporting' that they have shown since the Russian invasion.

By the end there was so little food and water that adults were eating one tiny meal a day. Two cups of macaroni went into 10 litres of water, and that 'soup' had to feed 30 people. The children ate twice. Still, they all shared their food with their pet. 'Someone would give him a spoon of porridge and everyone in the family would give him three or four spoons when they ate. Luckily, he is small,' said Olena Chekhonatski. She fled underground to escape shelling at the start of the war with her husband, Yegor, and two sons, 12-year-old Artem and 17-year-old Dmitry. They expected to stay perhaps two weeks, but only emerged two months later. 'I was never a dog person before Spike arrived,' she said with a rueful glance at the dog she starved herself to keep alive, as he bounded along the sandy shore of the Dnieper river on the family's first day of freedom since late February. The family were in the very last group of civilians officially evacuated from Azovstal, arriving in Ukrainian-held territory on the evening before Putin declared his war as a 'sacred' mission to liberate people like their family, at a military parade in Moscow. 'What liberation? What was the reason for all that?' Olena asked. 'Our first feeling is disbelief we made it out. The last days we were losing hope. The shelling was so heavy, it seemed impossible to get out,' Yegor added. While the family thought that they might be in the bunker for two weeks, others they sheltered with had prepared for only two days. More than two months later, they were still there, supplies of food and water dwindling as the buildings above them were ripped apart by Russian bombs. They had been deprived of almost everything except sleep. 'Sleep more, eat less. Because when you are asleep, you don't need to eat,' Yegor said. 'The plan now is to keep on living. The rest will follow.' When they moved in, there was electricity, but their world rapidly shrank in the mouldy basement, its dank smell seeping into their clothes and skin. The electricity was cut off after a day, and there was no internet, just a small radio that could pick up some longwave transmissions. They used car batteries to power LED lights, and in the gloom tried to make the hours pass with games. They had brought chess, backgammon and cards, and someone made a Mariupol monopoly set, with the city's industrial plants and malls replacing the streets of London. They can laugh about some things now. They foraged for food in the remains of a warehouse that had been bombed by the Russians, and one day Yegor went with two older men, who insisted on joining them despite their failing strength and eyesight. One came back with coffee beans he had mistaken for small pasta shapes and a giant bag of bay leaves. Neither helped with hunger, but they decided to crush the coffee with a hammer. 'I should say, it was a great cup of coffee,' he said. But every day was a gamble with death. Even a trip to the toilet meant risking their lives, because the latrines were on the ground floor. For children and older and disabled people, there were buckets in the shelter, which the adults took turns emptying. 'No one came out of there unchanged,' said Oksana, an Azovstal employee who asked not to give her full name for security reasons. 'They were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out.' In the early days, the children were obviously traumatised, she said. The teenagers spent hours staring at the walls, the younger children shied away from touch, and when she encouraged them to draw, they avoided the coloured pens and would do pictures only in black. Over time they adjusted a little to their terrifying new existence. 'Later they let us hug them, especially during the bombing. They made friends, and the older kids taught the younger kids. There was a four-year-old who could barely read the alphabet when they arrived, but by the end he could do maths and read and write well.' Oksana herself has emerged with three talismans from her descent into horror: her husband's teaspoon, from his work canteen; drawings by the children she guided through this time; and a passport cover with gleaming beadwork that she added herself, the only piece of her work she has left from a favourite hobby. 'I have nothing else from home.' They tried to leave when a 'green corridor' was announced in early March, but were driven back underground by fighting. They had watched dozens of people leave before them, including residents of a neighbouring bunker that ran out of food weeks before they did, but each trip was a gamble. 'When the children went outside, we made tags on their clothes with their names, blood types and date of birth. So at least if they were killed it would be easier to identify the bodies,' Oksana said. One group decided to hike the 100km to Berdyansk, through battlefields, minefields and ruins, because that seemed less terrifying than staying at the plant. 'We don't know if they made it.' Then they heard about the final attempts to set up civilian rescue corridors on the radio and decided to see if they could find a way out. Soldiers found them waiting outside, and said they had 15 minutes to get ready. They worry that there may be other desperate civilians trapped under the plant, who didn't have radios to learn about the evacuation, or weren't found by the soldiers. At a Russian 'filtration' camp, where evacuees are searched by authorities, the Chekhonatski family met a teenager who had spent the whole war hiding in a basement a few dozen metres from theirs with two other men. They had no idea he was there. They also worry about the troops who got them out, through the ruined complex. 'Not even heroes ... I don't know how to describe it. There's no word to express all our gratitude for what they've done for us,' Yegor said. 'I beg God, I hope some miracle happens and they make it out of there alive.' Oksana was overwhelmed, when she was finally able to charge her phone and turn it on after two months, to find a flood of messages from family, relatives and friends from across Ukraine and around the world. Many were the beneficiaries of a charity where she worked, which provided food and other aid to families with young children. 'I never imagined I would be the one needing help.' Artem Mazhulin contributed to the reporting on this story", "75e20e633af9ad092339947ed9d8aa65120334ef1055e4b47dfe57db": "Two Russian journalists working for a popular pro-Kremlin website filled it with anti-war articles on Monday morning in a rare act of dissent as the country celebrated the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. The articles on Lenta.ru called President Vladimir Putin a 'pitiful paranoid dictator' and accused him of waging 'the bloodiest war of the 21st century'. 'We had to do it today. We wanted to remind everyone what our grandfathers really fought for on this beautiful Victory Day - for peace,' said 30-year-old Egor Polyakov, one of the two journalists. During his annual speech in front of 11,000 soldiers in the Kremlin on Monday morning, Putin sought to justify his invasion of Ukraine, tying the current fighting to the Soviet victory in the second world war. 'This is not what Victory Day is about,' Polyakov told the Guardian in an interview. 'Ordinary people are dying, peaceful women and children are dying in Ukraine. Given the rhetoric that we have seen, this isn't going to stop. We couldn't accept this any longer. This was the only right thing we could do.' Polyakov, who works as a business reporter at Lenta, said he and his colleague Alexandra Miroshnikova published more than 40 articles critical of the Kremlin and its actions in Ukraine. The articles have since been taken down, but can be accessed through a web archive tool. Lenta, one of the largest sites in the country with more than 200 million monthly visitors, has been part of the relentless propaganda machine used to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Lenta is owned by Rambler, a media group that was bought in 2020 by Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, which is state-owned and under US and UK sanctions. Titles on the articles written and published by Polyakov and Miroshnikova on Monday morning included 'Vladimir Putin lied about Russia's plans in Ukraine', 'The Russian army turned out to be an army of thieves and looters' and 'Russia abandons the dead bodies of its troops in Ukraine.' Polyakov said each article was sourced from 'information available online', which he said he was usually not allowed to use given the outlet's 'editorial position' and strict censorship rules that in effect criminalise independent reporting. Polyakov and Miroshkina also published a personal letter on the website, which urged readers: 'Don't be afraid! Don't be silent! Fight back! You are not alone, there are many of us! The future is ours!' It is the first major act of protest seen in Russian state media since Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One, broke on to the set of the nightly news in mid-March shouting: 'Stop the war. No to war.' Pointing to recent laws introduced by Russia aimed at stifling anti-war dissent, Polyakov said he was now 'worried' for his safety. Russia has passed a number of laws making the spread of 'fake' information about the Russian army an offence punishable with fines or jail terms of up to 15 years. Russian authorities have already charged 46 people under such laws, with 14 of them now behind bars. 'Of course I am afraid,' Polyakov said. 'I am not ashamed to admit that. But I knew what I was doing, what the consequences could be.' In a separate development, the Rutube video platform was taken down by pro-Ukrainian hackers on Sunday night, while local television menus were hacked, with programme descriptions on smart TVs replaced by a message reading: 'The blood of thousands of Ukrainians and hundreds of murdered children is on your hands. TV and the authorities are lying. No to war.' State outlets have frequently been targeted by pro-Ukrainian hackers since the start of the war.

The reunion had been decades in the making, the final details hastily hashed out as Russian tanks rolled on to the streets of Ukraine. 'The moment was both happy and sad,' said Angelika Batiai, 24. 'Here I was seeing my sister again after 20 years, but on the other hand I had just left my family and friends in a country at war.' The half-sisters had spent the first years of their lives together in the southern Ukrainian village of Nikolaev, leaning on each other as they grew up with only an absentee mother to care for them. Family problems left them separated soon after; five-year-old Angelika was sent to live with an aunt and Tatyana, six, with a grandmother before ending up in state care. They begged to be kept together, recalled Tatyana Kluge Garcia, 25. 'But economically it was impossible, Angelika's aunt couldn't afford to take us both in.' At the age of eight, Tatyana was adopted by a family in the Spanish city of Girona, near Barcelona, trading her arduous beginning for a new family, country and slate of languages. Even as her command of Ukrainian faded, her sister remained constantly in her thoughts. 'I always said that I would go to Ukraine and find her,' said Tatyana. As a teenager she scoured social media for any trace of her sister, even downloading the Russian social network VK at one point. More than 2,000 miles away in Ukraine, Angelika was doing the same. When she stumbled across a Facebook profile in 2019 that showed a beaming young woman in Spain, she was certain she had found Tatyana. 'I just knew it was my sister.' Within weeks the two were chatting constantly online, pushing past language and cultural barriers. 'It was like a girlfriend that you're getting to know but really it's your sister and you want to share your life with her,' said Tatyana. Excitedly they made plans to meet up in Spain, only to have the possibility derailed by the pandemic. In February, as Russian troops amassed on the border of Ukraine, Tatyana made a frantic call to Angelika. 'I told her that here they're saying that there's going to be a war,' she said. Angelika sought to temper her sister's fears. 'I was hoping all of this would blow over and everything would be fine,' she said. 'But it just got worse and worse.' She and her fiance left their home in Nova Odesa, heading to a nearby village where her cousin had converted his basement into a makeshift shelter. As the sound of bombings cracked in the distance, they would dart into the basement. 'Tatyana was texting me every day, saying pack up, we're all waiting for you, we're worried,' she said. Angelika canvassed those around her, but her loved ones were determined to stay. 'It was a very difficult decision because I didn't want to leave my family,' she said. 'I was also very worried about how I was going to get there on my own - it was a long way.' In the end it was a message from Tatyana's mother, reinforcing that she would be safe in Spain, that convinced Angelika. She set off for the Polish border in a vehicle with other Ukrainians looking to leave, steeling herself for the worst. 'I was terrified we would be detained or that there would be an air alert,' said Angelika. Her anxiety was laced with nervousness for what lay ahead: 'The whole way I was thinking about what it would be like to see my sister and whether she would accept me,' she said. From her home in Girona, Tatyana tracked Angelika's every step. She bought her a plane ticket from Warsaw, battling spotty mobile coverage and language barriers to make sure her sister made it on to the flight. 'I was going crazy,' said Tatyana. 'She had never been on a plane, she didn't know how to check in or check her baggage.' The days of anxiety melted away as soon as she spotted her sister. 'I had always wondered what that moment would be like,' said Tatyana. 'You think: 'Maybe I'll be in shock, maybe I won't know what to say, maybe I'll cry.' But in the end I just couldn't believe it was happening.' In the month since Angelika's arrival in Spain, the sisters have carved out a comfortable coexistence in Tatyana's apartment, using hand gestures, a handful of shared vocabulary and a lot of Google Translate to communicate. The ease of their interactions belies their decades apart; Angelika, who hates carrying a handbag, stuffs her phone and charger into her older sister's purse whenever they leave the house, while the two trade quiet nods of affirmation as they delve into the details of their past. 'There are days that go by and I'm looking at her and I still can't believe it,' said Tatyana. 'I just think: 'You're here.'' Echoing the uncertainty facing many of the 135,000 Ukrainian refugees who have arrived in Spain in recent months, neither sister knows what comes next: whether Angelika will eventually return to her fiance, job and family in Ukraine, or seek to bring them to Spain and start over. 'Since we were little we've been dreaming of seeing each other again, but we would never have imagined that it would be because of a war,' said Tatyana. For Angelika, being back with her sister was a 'wonderful, unbelievable feeling'. The joy, however, was rivalled by the angst of leaving her loved ones in a country at war.  'I just can't stop thinking about it.'", "1a826d949ca2b7b14973f908024e90a3ee8cc021cbe08564389a4f0d": "South Korea's new president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has offered North Korea 'an audacious plan' to transform its creaking economy in return for abandoning its nuclear weapons programme. Speaking on the first day of his presidency on Tuesday, Yoon said: 'While North Korea's nuclear weapon programmes are a threat not only to our security and that of North-east Asia, the door to dialogue will remain open so that we can peacefully resolve this threat.' Yoon has previously vowed to take a tougher stance against Pyongyang than his predecessor, but appears to have avoided provoking the regime amid speculation that it could be preparing to conduct a nuclear test. North Korea has previously rejected incentives tied to progress on abandoning its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. 'If North Korea genuinely embarks on a process to complete denuclearisation, we are prepared to work with the international community to present an audacious plan that will vastly strengthen North Korea's economy and improve the quality of life for its people,' he told a crowd of 40,000 people attending his inauguration outside the national assembly in Seoul, according to the Yonhap news agency. The North's missiles and nukes were a threat to South Korean, regional and global security, he said, adding: 'The door to dialogue will remain open so that we can peacefully resolve this threat.' Yoon, a conservative who replaced the liberal former human rights lawyer Moon Jae-in, officially began his presidency at midnight on Monday with a security briefing at an underground bunker - a sign that the North's nuclear weapons will be high on the agenda throughout his single five-year term. Pyongyang prefaced Yoon's inauguration, after a closely contested, rancorous campaign, by conducting a volley of test launches, including those involving long-range missiles. The North's leader, Kim Jong-un, could dramatically raise the diplomatic stakes very soon, with US and South Korean officials speculating that the regime could be preparing to conduct its first nuclear test since 2017 later this month, possibly around the time Yoon is due to meet Joe Biden in Seoul. 'North Korea has the initiative. Regardless of whether conservatives or liberals are in power in South Korea, North Korea is pressing ahead with missile tests under its own weapons development timetable before it tries to tip the balance later,' said Park Won Gon, a professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. 'North Korea will now continue its provocations, but there are no ways to stop it.' Yoon's decision to join his first security briefing in a bunker is symbolic of his campaign pledges to take a tougher stance on North Korea after Moon's attempts to engage with Kim failed to make progress on denuclearisation. In a recent interview with Voice of America, Yoon said that a meeting with Kim was not off the table, but would need to produce results. 'There's no reason to avoid meeting' Kim, he said. 'However, if we are not be able to show any results, or results are just for show and does not have actual outcomes in denuclearisation ... it's not going to help the relationship between the two Koreas progress.' At home, where he faces a deeply divided public and a hostile national assembly controlled by the main opposition Democratic party, Yoon will be expected to tackle inflation - now at a 13-year high - that threatens his campaign pledge to address growing inequality and rising property prices in the world's 10th biggest economy. Yoon, though, has been denied the usual honeymoon period enjoyed by new presidents. Only 55% of respondents expect him to do a good job as president - an unusually low figure compared to his predecessors - according to a poll by Gallup Korea. As Moon's former prosecutor-general, Yoon helped investigate another former president, Park Geun-hye, before she was impeached and imprisoned in 2017 for corruption and abuse of power. He has vowed to continue the fight against corruption, even as several of his cabinet nominees were accused of ethical lapses and misconduct. Yoon will also come under pressure to address simmering resentment among young men - a key source of support in the election - over what they perceive as unfair advantages given to women, even though South Korea fares poorly in gender equality. Yoon said he would abolish the country's gender equality ministry, but has since suggested that it is no longer a policy priority, leading to speculation that he will 'rebrand' the body rather than abolish it. He has also indicated he intends to build 'future-oriented' relations with Japan after years of tension linked to the countries' bitter wartime legacy. The North-east Asian neighbours have yet to resolve disputes over the Japanese military's use of Korean sex slaves before and during the second world war. They are also at loggerheads over compensation for Korean labourers forcibly brought to Japan during its 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula, and competing claims to the Takeshima islands, known as Dokdo by Koreans. In what is being seen as a sign of a possible thaw in relations, Yoon sent a delegation to Tokyo last month, while Japan's foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, was among 300 foreign guests at his swearing-in ceremony.

With more than 70% of the votes tabulated, Marcos Jr had more than 23.5m, far ahead of his closest rival, the current vice-president, Leni Robredo, a former human rights lawyer, who had 11.1m. The size of his lead means a comeback by his opponents is not possible. Supporters dressed in red shirts, his campaign colour, gathered outside his camp's headquarters in Mandaluyong City on Monday night, waving the flag of the Philippines as passing cars sounded their horns. Marcos thanked volunteers and political leaders 'that have cast their lot with us' in a late-night video message, but he stopped short of claiming victory. 'Let's wait until it's very clear, until the count reaches 100%, then we can celebrate,' he said. Marcos Jr, 64, ran with the slogan 'Together we shall rise again', invoking nostalgia for his father's authoritarian regime, which the family and its supporters have portrayed as a golden era in a campaign fuelled by online disinformation as social media has been flooded with false stories that have swept aside the atrocities and corruption widespread during the period. Such portrayals have horrified survivors of Marcos Sr's brutal regime. Thousands of political opponents were tortured, arrested and disappeared under his rule, while as much as $10bn was plundered. Marcos Sr was ousted in the People Power revolution in 1986, when the family was humiliatingly airlifted from the presidential palace by helicopter, and fled into exile. Ever since, say analysts, the Marcoses have sought to rebrand themselves and regain their place in politics. 'The disinformation infrastructure has been there for a long time. It's not as if it just sprouted during this campaign. The Marcoses' plan to reach the presidency has been in action for decades,' said Aries Arugay, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, who is based in Manila. Marcos Jr had maintained a clear lead over his opponents in surveys conducted in the run-up to the vote, with Robredo second. A former human rights lawyer who has advocated for marginalised groups, she campaigned on a promise of good governance and an end to corruption. People began lining up to vote before polling centres opened at 6am local time (2300 BST) on Monday morning, and some waited more than four hours in the heat as malfunctioning voting machines caused delays. The vote followed three months of fierce campaigning, in which 2 million Robredo volunteers launched an unprecedented door-to-door campaign to try to win over voters and counter the onslaught of online disinformation. Although Marcos Jr has denied the existence of any organised online campaign, he was the overwhelming beneficiary of false claims circulating on social media. The majority of disinformation was either designed to undermine Robredo's reputation or enhance the images of the Marcoses, according to analysis by the fact-checking coalition Tsek.ph, which monitored disinformation in the run-up to the election. Marcos Jr has avoided TV debates and challenging media interviews ahead of the election, and his campaign has been thin on policy detail. Marcos Jr's candidacy has polarised opinion, and some do not believe that the family has plundered state wealth, despite court rulings at home and abroad. At Santa Ana elementary school, in a residential area of Manila, which opened as a polling station, Raquel Deguzaman, 59, said she supported Marcos Jr and did not believe the family was corrupt. '[Marcos Sr] was able to help the Philippines. He's really good,' she said, adding that he had built infrastructure, including hospitals. Jack Drescher, 58, who was on his way to vote, also cited the building of infrastructure under Marcos Sr as a reason for backing his son. He was not concerned about corruption within the family, he said. 'He has a lot of gold so he won't steal any money,' he said, adding that he had heard this from YouTube. A myth claiming that the Marcoses own large stashes of gold has circulated online in various forms for years, including the claim that it will be given back to the people if the family is returned to power. The idea that Marcos Sr's rule was a prosperous and peaceful era appeals to a generation of voters who did not live through Marcos Sr's martial law regime, including those who 'may harbour deep dissatisfaction with the non-inclusive development of the past 30 or so years,' said Ronald Mendoza, dean of Manila's Ateneo school of government. Cleo Anne A Calimbahin, an associate professor of political science at De La Salle University Manila, said the results should not come as a surprise but that they were sobering. They reflected in part a growing frustration among the public with previous administrations. 'I think this is a response of a public that saw the lack of progress made since 1986,' said Calimbahin, referencing the People Power revolution that put the Philippines on the road to democracy, a process that has not been linear. 'Unfortunately, the reforms agenda and its inability to deliver since 1986 has made people even wary of reformist candidates,' said Calimbahin.The election winner will take office on 30 June for a single six-year term.", "22c628ca7725390cdaaf395af9908da30f53ad6f28eb8914647c8eeb": "The Queen is to miss the state opening of parliament for only the third time in her reign. The 96-year-old monarch, who is experiencing mobility issues, will not read the Queen's speech on Tuesday, Buckingham Palace said. The Prince of Wales will read it on her behalf. As Charles takes on the head of state's major constitutional duty for the first time, the move - believed to be unprecedented in modern history - will be interpreted as a significant shift in his responsibilities as a king in waiting. The Queen's speech will be read by the prince after a new letters patent, authorised by the Queen, was issued that delegated the royal function of opening a new session of parliament to the counsellors of state. The Duke of Cambridge will also attend the state opening, as a counsellor of state. As opening parliament is a core constitutional responsibility of the monarch, the letters patent had to be issued to delegate that responsibility to two counsellors of state. There are currently four counsellors of state: Charles, William, Andrew and Harry. No other functions have been delegated by the Queen. The Duchess of Cornwall will also attend, although she is not a counsellor of state. The new arrangement will leave the main throne empty during the ceremony, as Charles and Camilla take their usual seats, with William on the opposite side to Camilla. The imperial state crown will still travel to parliament. In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: 'The Queen continues to experience episodic mobility problems, and in consultation with her doctors has reluctantly decided that she will not attend the state opening of parliament tomorrow.'  A No 10 spokesperson said: 'The prime minister fully respects the wishes of Her Majesty and is grateful to the Prince of Wales for agreeing to deliver the speech on her behalf.' The letters patent was issued to cover the state opening. In this instance, it enables Charles and William to jointly exercise that function. No other functions have been delegated by the Queen. The decision was taken on Monday. The mobility problems are said to be a continuation of those the Queen has experienced since the autumn. In order to prevent delay or difficulty in the dispatch of public business, the sovereign may issue a letter patent delegating specified 'royal functions' to counsellors of state, as provided for in section 6 of the Regency Act 1937.  Last week it was announced the Queen would not be attending this year's royal garden parties. The Queen is understood to have a busy diary at Windsor this week with a call with Australia on Monday, and a planned virtual privy council and phone audience with the prime minister on Wednesday. She is expected to undertake some private engagements later in the week. The Queen has opened every session of parliament since her accession in 1952, except in 1959 and 1963 when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward respectively. On those two occasions, the sessions were opened by the lords commissioners, while the lord chancellor read the Queen's speech. Last week it was announced that the Queen would not attend any of this summer's garden parties at Buckingham Palace and at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. Constitutional expert Dr Bob Morris, of UCL's constitution unit, told the PA news agency that the arrangements, with both Charles and William attending and the prince reading the speech, were unprecedented. 'They've gone down the counsellor of state route - that's one way round it. The Prince of Wales is giving the speech and William is there as his stay and support, as it were,' he said. 'It's a rather odd confection, but it works.' He added: 'It is unprecedented and it's the way in which the constitution flexes to accommodate unusual circumstances. I can't think of any possible earlier version of this.'", "d97a66ac76d0d878c3f1d7fa81357d2ac70cb893b65031faa771725e": "The unrelenting slaughter of Mexican journalists has continued after two more newspeople were gunned down by unidentified assassins - taking the 2022 death toll to 11 in what is the deadliest country for media professionals outside a warzone. Yesenia Mollinedo Falconi and Sheila Johana Garcia Olivera were murdered in the town of Cosoleacaque, about 350 miles east of the capital Mexico City, around 3pm on Monday. According to reports, Mollinedo, the director of a weekly publication called El Veraz, and Garcia, a reporter, were shot inside their Ford Ikon outside a roadside convenience store. 'They have despicably and cowardly murdered a fellow reporter,' one local journalist announced in a video dispatch from the crime scene, as rifle-toting security forces surrounded the area. Mollinedo and Garcia are only the latest in a succession of Mexican reporters to lose their lives this year in what is a growing scandal that the president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has been accused of failing to adequately address. In fact, many critics believe Lopez Obrador, a media-bashing populist known as Amlo, is fuelling the violence with his incessant public attacks on journalists who he has labelled ill-intentioned conservative 'mercenaries' bent on undermining his nationalist administration. Attacks on the press have surged 85% in the three years since Amlo took power in December 2018 with every single Mexican state witnessing such incidents for the first time in 2021. Seven journalists were killed in the whole of last year, compared to 11 in the first five months of 2022. 'Every day [Amlo] urges society to discredit the journalistic profession - and clearly we are paying the price in blood,' said Sonia de Anda, a Tijuana-based journalist who recently confronted Mexico's president over the killings. Tijuana, which sits on the US border near San Diego, has suffered most this year, with two prominent journalists murdered outside their homes there since January: the photojournalist Margarito Martinez Esquivel and the television reporter Lourdes Maldonado. The government has blamed both killings on people linked to the Arellano-Felix crime cartel - but many are skeptical. 'Tijuana's got a pretty long history of grabbing someone who may have had the gun in their hand, but not touching the person who was actually responsible,' Michael Lettieri, a San Diego-based researcher and human rights activist told the San Diego Union-Tribune this week. Speaking earlier this year, Adela Navarro Bello, the director of the Tijuana weekly Zeta, said: 'Right now the Mexican press is caught in the crossfire between the threats and bullets of narco-traffickers and organized crime and the threats and verbal attacks and attempts to morally annihilate us from the federal and state governments.' 'When a journalist is murdered, it's not just the family that loses their loved one ... society loses too,' added Navarro Bello, whose publication has not put a reporter's name on an investigative story since 2006 for fear of them being shot dead. 'When a journalist is murdered society becomes a little bit blinder and a little bit more deaf.' The attorney general's office in Veracruz state, where Cosoleacaque is located, insisted Monday's murders would not go unpunished. 'All lines of inquiry will be pursued, including any connection to their journalistic activities,' it said on Twitter. However, campaigners say there is impunity in 90% of such crimes and see little sign of change. Griselda Triana, a journalist whose crime reporter husband, Javier Valdez Cardenas, was assassinated five years ago, was among dozens of demonstrators who hit the streets of Mexico City on Monday afternoon to protest the tsunami of murders. 'It is so easy for them to kill a journalist,' Triana lamented, remembering how her family had been shattered by his notorious 2017 shooting in Culiacan state. 'Sometimes they threaten them, sometimes the victim gets no warning at all and they just get rid of them. Justice either takes too long, or never comes at all.' 'It's a feeling of such helplessness,' said Pablo Perez, a Mexican producer for Al Jazeera who was also at the demonstration. 'Eleven [murders] is heartbreaking and the naturalness of knowing that before long there will be another killing is absurd.' Jordi Lebrija, a Tijuana journalist who was friends with Margarito Martinez, noted how nearly all of the journalists murdered this year were, like him, killed outside their homes. 'It's a message. Not even outside your house are you safe,' Lebrija said as he stood at the spot where Martinez had died. 'We are looking at you. We know who you are. We know what you do. That's the message for journalists.'", "73308f9f037f34831bdc203556c012ae0a14b6deffcfefe2b88f2452": "New Zealand has recorded more than 1m cases of Covid-19, after spending the first 18 months of the pandemic largely free of the virus.  The milestone reflects a stark change in New Zealand's pandemic experience, with more than 986,000 of those cases hitting in the months since the start of 2022. The country has had a huge spike in cases since Omicron breached the borders in December 2021, and the government loosened most restrictions in March.  Tuesday's official 1 million case milestone means at least 20% of the population has now been infected, but modellers said the true number of infections is likely three times higher. 'We know that the number of cases that we're seeing are just a fraction of the true number of infections that are happening,' said Dr Dion O'Neale of Covid Modelling Aotearoa, based at the University of Auckland. O'Neale said modellers' best estimates were that official case numbers recorded around a third of actual infections - meaning that New Zealand would have now had about 3m infections. Cases were missed for a variety of reasons, he said: some were asymptomatic, some didn't report positive test results, some didn't have easy access to testing, and people reluctant to get vaccinated were also reluctant to test or report an infection. Despite the rise in cases, New Zealand's death rate has remained relatively low by international standards. The total number of publicly reported deaths with Covid-19 is now 876 for the entirety of the pandemic - that figure includes all those who die within 28 days of contracting the virus. Hong Kong, another Covid-elimination state, has recorded more than 9,300 deaths for its population of 7.48m. New Zealand's low death rate has been assisted by its high levels of vaccination - 95% of adults are double-vaccinated, and 70% have had an additional booster shot. Director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said: 'I would like to reiterate my thanks to everyone in New Zealand who has played their part to keep our case numbers and rates low when compared internationally, and for continuing to do their bit to follow public health advice and minimise the spread of Covid-19.' O'Neale said that not knowing true infection numbers could present challenges for New Zealand down the line - making it more difficult to predict subsequent waves, reinfection rates, or the burden of long Covid.", "436eabe1d4a779f7dbf6cdb7184ec2d1a085cb3d673f225fc7ee13b9": "The capture of a former Alabama jail official, along with a murder suspect she allegedly helped escape from custody, ended in tragedy on Monday when the jail official, Vicky White, fatally shot herself after a police chase. Vicky White, 56, was accused of fleeing with Casey White, 38. The pair spent more than a week on the run before law enforcement in Indiana caught up to them. Officials said the two fugitives were caught near Evansville, Indiana, after a car chase that ended in a crash. Casey White surrendered and Vicky White shot herself and was taken to a hospital where she later died, officials said.  Casey White remains in custody. 'We got a dangerous man off the street today. He is never going to see the light of day again. That is a good thing, for not just our community. That's a good thing for our country,' said Rick Singleton, the sheriff of Alabama's Lauderdale county. The pair had been the target of a nationwide manhunt since 29 April when Vicky White, the assistant director of corrections for the jail in Lauderdale County, allegedly helped engineer the escape of Casey White, who was awaiting trial in a capital murder case. Vicky White had told co-workers she was taking the prisoner from the jail for a mental health evaluation at the courthouse, but the two instead fled the area. In Indiana, Vanderburgh county Sheriff Dave Wedding said officials had learned that their vehicle was near the sheriff's office. As officers arrived, Casey and Vicky White fled in the vehicle and led police on a pursuit, he said. US marshals collided with them 'to try to end the pursuit', he said. Casey White was injured, not too seriously, in the ensuing crash and Vicky White then shot herself, causing 'very serious' injuries, he said. Casey White was serving a 75-year prison sentence for attempted murder and other charges at the time of his escape. He was awaiting trial in the stabbing of a 58-year-old woman during a burglary in 2015. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Vicky White's family members and co-workers said they were stunned by her involvement. Singleton had said that, in hindsight, it appeared the plan had been in the works for some time. Prisoners at the jail said the two had a special relationship and she gave Casey White better treatment than other inmates. She had recently sold her home and had communicated with Casey White when he was in a state prison. In the past several months, she bought a rifle and a shotgun and also was known to have a handgun, US marshal Marty Keely said. She sold her house for about half of market value and bought a 2007 orange Ford Edge that she stashed at a shopping center without license plates. 'This escape was obviously well-planned and calculated. A lot of preparation went into this. They had plenty of resources, had cash, had vehicles,' Singleton said. A warrant was issued on 2 May for Vicky Sue White, charging her with permitting or facilitating escape in the first degree. The pickup truck, a 2006 Ford F-150, was found Monday in Evansville after US marshals received a tip on Sunday that the pickup was seen at a car wash in the town, the marshals service said. Surveillance photos showed a man who closely resembles Casey White exiting the vehicle at the car wash, officials said. Investigators believe the pickup truck was stolen in Tennessee and then driven about 175 miles to Evansville, a law enforcement official told the Associated Press. The official could not discuss details of the investigation publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Federal and local law enforcement officials have also learned Casey White threatened to kill his former girlfriend and his sister in 2015 and said 'that he wanted police to kill him,' the marshals service said. Investigators said they have been in contact with them about the threats and are taking measures to ensure their safety.", "ce3425032c01b79ccdaaf606caed1536a9f54b43741c7d0de2a04840": "", "5ea7e7db4bb560b7e457b8cfad5f7f37d3a58c53da8f2f5ff755c19a": "", "18296e78b270c449974f26cb1d0bee6e11d98d22c2a0c1ac9e42dfbc": "Many of us have a never-ending list of tasks that are work-related, but not quite work: writing up minutes from meetings, assembling entries for awards, serving on committees, selecting interns, organising holiday parties, shopping for leaving gifts. Many, if not most, working women accept it as just part of the job. But taking one for the team could be holding all women back. A new book argues that 'non-promotable work' - the kind that is important to organisational functioning, but unlikely to be rewarded or even recognised - is the invisible hurdle to gender equality in the workplace, with women's time and energy being disproportionately expended on thankless tasks. 'It's not that women are do-gooders, who want to help out the group,' says Lise Vesterlund, an economics professor at the University of Pittsburgh. 'They're doing it because we're expecting them to.' Vesterlund and three friends wrote The No Club: Putting a Stop to Women's Dead-End Work after finding themselves overwhelmed in their own careers a decade ago. 'Initially it was about getting our own work lives under control,' she says. Over years of research they found that across the public and private sectors, and a wide range of roles, female employees were shouldering the burden of 'office housework' and low-value assignments, causing them to miss out on promotions and pay increases. 'We think this is a central part of why women are not advancing at similar rates to men,' says Vesterlund. From teachers to engineers, investment bankers to checkout clerks, 'there is not an industry, occupation or rank that we have looked at where we didn't see this being a problem'. Their analysis of employee hours at a large consultancy firm found that regardless of seniority, the median woman spent about 200 more hours on non-promotable work each year than the median man - equating to approximately one month's worth of dead-end tasks. For junior women, it seemed to come at the expense of meaningful work, with junior men spending about 250 more hours each year on high-value work such as with clients. Senior women, on the other hand, spent the same amount of time on promotable tasks as senior men - meaning they just worked more hours in total. The firm's executives were 'shocked' to learn of the size of the imbalance, says Vesterlund. 'The magnitude of this is just so much greater than what organisations expect, which is why we need to spread the word.' The reason for this imbalance is twofold, says Vesterlund: not only are women asked to do this work more often than men; when asked, they are more likely to say yes. 'Women feel guilty when they say no - because we expect them to say yes.' One experiment found that in a mixed-gender group, women were 48% more likely to volunteer to take on a task than men were. (Men volunteered more often when in a group without women.) This collective expectation has been internalised by managers and employees alike, derailing individual careers and entrenching inequality. Vesterlund's research found that employees with less productive assignments were paid less and found themselves unable to increase their pay through negotiation. 'Men are also more strategic in the non-promotable work that they do, selecting the tasks that will get them access and connections,' Vesterlund says. A 2021 report by McKinsey found women to be taking the lead on employee wellbeing and diversity, equity and inclusion - often without thanks, even as such initiatives were trumpeted through the pandemic. 'It is clearly seen as being critical work but it is not being rewarded or recognised,' says Vesterlund. In fact, company commitments to equal representation - such as on panels or committees - can pile the responsibility on to just a few individuals, says Vesterlund, with minority ethnic women in particular 'taxed' for their underrepresentation. One study of teaching staff at a US university in 2012 found academics of colour spent three more hours a week on non-promotable service tasks than their white counterparts, with one respondent noting: 'If you are one of two women in your department ... [you] go on a lot of dinners.' Combined with domestic responsibilities, not least caring for children and elderly relatives, this personal-pressure pileup is coalescing into a mental health crisis among working women. 'The risk ... remains very real,' warned the McKinsey report. But Vesterlund and her co-authors argue that until the problem of non-promotable work is tackled, inequalities will persist. The switch to hybrid working, often presented as increasing flexibility, could in fact worsen the problem by making women less visible. A Deloitte survey found that nearly 60% of those working remotely felt excluded from meetings, while 45% said they did not have enough exposure to leaders. Vesterlund says the solution is for employers and employees to reflect on how non-promotable tasks are allocated within their organisation so that it can be made fairer. Managers could assign tasks at random or by a rota, split them between multiple employees, or align them with existing responsibilities or skills. 'The solution is to change the way we distribute work: once we give men and women equal opportunities to get assignments, many things will fall into place,' says Vesterlund. In the meantime, the challenge is resisting the status quo. 'When women are expected to say yes, it can cause backlash when they say no,' says Vesterlund. Men can help to redress the balance by putting themselves forward for non-promotable tasks before a female colleague volunteers, or by taking some off her plate. Meanwhile, women can support each other to protect their time and boundaries, just as Vesterlund and her co-authors started doing a decade ago. Even so, she says: 'I continue to be shocked by how easy it is for some of my male colleagues to say no - and how hard it is for me.'", "07b5d0c843e2c164bb3d8cad3b9b774d71f4d4e52094f6a83794203e": "", "af0480d9f23ec7501d9c12356c68b72c5e71a9bafb83b28a5653be75": "", "6be38d691f82e6f1990b5e7aab9ae8ec8e4cc29323677ca864c3dc26": "In early February 1814, an elephant walked across the surface of the Thames near Blackfriars Bridge in London. The stunt was performed during the frost fair, when temperatures were so cold that for four days the top layers of the river froze solid. Londoners promptly held a festival, complete with what we might now call pop-up shops and a lot of unlicensed alcohol. Nobody could have known it at the time, but this was the last of the Thames frost fairs. They had taken place every few decades, at wildly irregular intervals, for several centuries. One of the most celebrated fairs took place during the Great Frost of 1683-84 and saw the birth of Chipperfield's Circus. But the river in central London has not frozen over since 1814. The frost fairs are perhaps the most emblematic consequences of the 'little ice age', a period of chilly weather that lasted for several centuries. But while Londoners partied on the ice, other communities faced crop failures and other threats. The story of the little ice age is one of societies forced to adapt to changing conditions or perish. It's also a long-standing mystery. Why did the climate cool and why did it stay that way for centuries? Thanks to decades of studies, we are finally closing in on an explanation. The emerging story involves volcanoes, the oceans, possibly the sun and possibly also genocide. Like most things in science, the little ice age was discovered slowly and piecemeal. 'This all came about because there were lots of documentary records from around Europe, stating that there were some really cold winters,' says climatologist Paola Moffa-Sanchez of Durham University. These were reflected in records of grain prices, which rose because of crop failures and ships' logs saying Greenland was surrounded by sea ice and unreachable. The term 'little ice age' was coined by a Dutch-born geologist named Francois Matthes, who in a 1939 report noted that glaciers in the Sierra Nevada in California had regrown at some point within the last few millennia. The term stuck, but it took decades to narrow down the timeframe. This was done by British climatologist Hubert Lamb, who went on to found the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. In a study published in 1965, Lamb used European temperature records going back many centuries to identify a 'notably warm climate... around AD1000-1200' that was 'followed by a decline of temperature levels till between 1500 and 1700 the coldest phase since the last ice age occurred'. This chilly period was 'undoubtedly upsetting for the human economies of those times (and perhaps of any time)' [his italics]. Since then, climatologists have tried to specify the duration and extent of the little ice age, but this has proved difficult. Most of the records showing the cooling are from Europe and records from elsewhere do not always show it. 'It's not a global phenomenon, in that it wasn't cool everywhere,' says Alexander Koch at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. In some places, such as China, the period was marked by a wetter but not cooler climate. What's more, 'the cooling was not continuous', says Dagomar Degroot of Georgetown University in Washington DC. 'It came in waves... that reached different places at different times at different magnitudes.' For this reason, the start and end of the little ice age are a little vague. 'The classical definition is between 1400 and 1850,' says Moffa-Sanchez. However, 'some people say 1300 to 1850', pushing the start date back significantly. There is broad agreement that the period 1400-1800 is within the little ice age, she says, but outside that it's fuzzy. Either way, the 1814 frost fair was near the end of the period. Furthermore, the little ice age was not technically an ice age. These are periods in which Earth has permanent ice at both poles and we have been in one for more than 2.5m years. Within that period, the ice sheets have repeatedly waxed and waned. The most recent ice advance, which we colloquially call the ice age but is really a glacial period, occurred from about 115,000 to  11,700 years ago. Since then, we have been in a relatively warm period called the Holocene. In that context, the little ice age is minor. 'We're talking about several 10ths of a degree C,' says Degroot. In contrast, the coldest portion of the last glacial period is thought to have been about 6C cooler than the past 4,000 years. Still, Degroot says, even this small change mattered. 'On a regional or local scale, the anomalies could be really quite extreme,' he says, and documentary evidence shows that 'at least some people were aware that they were living in an anomalous kind of climate'. What was going on? The story isn't entirely settled, but researchers are increasingly confident about the initial trigger: volcanoes. 'You have these eruptions that are happening in clusters,' says Degroot. A 2015 study used data from ice cores to identify 25 major eruptions from the past 2,500 years. Between 1200 and 1400, there were huge eruptions of the Samalas volcano in Indonesia, Quilotoa in Ecuador and El Chichon in Mexico. Big eruptions blast sulphate aerosols into the stratosphere, the layer of the atmosphere above the weather. These aerosols reflect some of the sun's rays back into space, cooling the Earth. In recent times, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Phillippines triggered up to 0.5C of surface cooling. Usually, an eruption only cools the climate for a few years. 'But if you have big eruptions in clusters, that can set off positive feedbacks in the climate system,' says Degroot. For example, several years of cooler temperatures cause sea ice to expand. Sea ice is white, so compared with dark blue water it reflects more radiation back into space. 'That can prolong and exacerbate the cooling,' he adds. There can also be knock-on effects in the ocean, says Moffa-Sanchez. If the winds change, huge rafts of sea ice can be carried south from Greenland into the Labrador Sea. There, they interfere with the huge Atlantic currents that carry warm water from the tropics towards Europe. This is a complex story, in which the slight initial cooling from the volcanoes triggers changes in the Earth system that lead to more and lasting cooling. But it seems to hold true. A 2018 modelling study found that it was not possible to explain the little ice age without invoking volcanic eruptions, although that did not mean other factors were not also at work. Another possible factor is the sun. The amount of energy it pumps out varies ever so slightly, most famously over the 11-year solar cycle during which activity varies from a maximum to a minimum and back again. The effects on Earth are so small they're hard to detect, but the sun sometimes has more of an impact. Several times in the past 1,000 years, our star has entered a 'grand minimum', in which it spends several decades being less active. The most recent was the Dalton Minimum between 1790 and 1820. This was preceded by the Maunder Minimum of 1645-1715. Before that, there is thought to have been the Sporer Minimum between about 1460 and 1550 and the Wolf Minimum around 1280-1350. Such grand minima can cool the planet, though by no more than 0.3C and probably less. Grand minima probably played a role in some of the chilliest episodes, says Moffa-Sanchez. In her studies of the period, 'cold centuries coincided with these really famous solar minima.' She has found evidence that grand minima affect wind patterns, with knock-on effects for ocean currents and heat distribution. However, it seems unlikely that grand minima alone caused the little ice age. The timings don't fit and, in any case, the climate impacts of grand minima are much smaller than those of massive eruptions. It may be that a solar maximum in the late 1300s also played a role. A study published in December 2021 found that this shifted wind patterns, interfering with the crucial Atlantic warm water current. The key point is - this isn't an either-or debate, says Moffa-Sanchez. 'It's a likely combination of all of them.' Numerous causes helps explain why the climate shifts came in waves, rather than there being one abrupt change to a lasting cooler state. 'It was not that you had this little ice age period where it was always cold,' says Moffa-Sanchez. 'You just had several cold centuries throughout this four-century-long period.' However, one big puzzle remains. The coldest period of the little ice age was around 1610 and it doesn't coincide with a grand minimum. Nor was there a particularly big eruption: Peru's Huaynaputina went off in 1600, but while the blast was large it wasn't exceptional. Instead, the suggestion is that this cold spell was caused by humanity - in a truly horrible way. In 1492, Christopher Columbus reached the Americas. Over the following decades, Europeans began colonising them. In the process, they fought with Indigenous Americans, often killing them. But even more lethally, they brought diseases. One of the worst was smallpox, which killed millions. As well as being a genocide and a tragedy, this may have had an impact on the climate. Many Indigenous Americans were farmers who had cleared forests for their crops and when they died the trees grew back, drawing carbon dioxide out of the air and cooling the planet. This scenario was first outlined by climatologist William Ruddiman in 2003, as part of his 'early Anthropocene' hypothesis that humans have been affecting Earth's climate for millennia, albeit less than we are today. The idea that mass deaths among Indigenous Americans led to climate cooling has received tentative support from modelling studies. Still, it has been controversial because there are so many uncertainties about the key numbers. However, in 2019 Koch and his colleagues published an updated analysis. They went through the argument step by step and tried to quantify everything, from the number of people who died to the extent of reforestation. They concluded that the European arrival led to 56m deaths by 1600. This dreadful toll meant trees grew again on 56m hectares of land, removing 27.4bn bn kilograms of carbon dioxide from the air.  'It's a really interesting theory,' says Degroot. However, he remains sceptical because we don't know how land use was changing in other parts of the world, especially Africa. While the question of whether human society contributed to the little ice agee remains up for discussion, what's clear is that the little ice age affected human society. For example, Norse settlers made their home in Greenland in 985 and stayed for centuries, only abandoning it in the early 1400s. It has often been suggested that the little ice age played a role in that. However, a study published in March looked at sediments from the region and found no sign of cooling, but it did find a drying trend, which would have meant less grass to feed livestock. Such stories may be true, but it's crucial to remember that people were not passive victims, says Degroot. 'You don't just see people who are completely at the whim of changing climatic conditions, you see people changing adaptively.' Degroot points to the Arctic, where there was often remarkable activity despite the increase in sea ice. Between 1611 and 1619, European whalers operated off the shores of Svalbard, because there was a shortage of vegetable oil and whale oil was a substitute. For the Dutch Republic, the period between 1560 and 1720 was something of a golden age, despite or even because of the cold winters. It did not depend on home-grown agriculture, so local crop failures were less of a problem, says Degroot. Instead, the republic's economy was driven by merchant ships, whose operators devised ingenious ways to cope with the cold - and the Dutch thrived while their neighbours struggled. 'It so rarely is what you'd expect,' says Degroot. Studying how past societies responded to climatic shifts such as the little ice age will help us all, as the climate crisis becomes ever more intense. 'Hopefully, we can learn from them, figure out what they did right, what they did wrong.' We had better learn fast, because the little ice age was just a taster. Back then, the average global temperature cooled by a fraction of a degree, but we've already warmed it by 1.1C, and are set to blow past 1.5C in the next few decades.", "cd17463f331c0a85a8aa5d507e24dd8d6eb511010e832db748c15601": "", "8348841af888ae9b42b243a8d88411bb68a7a4d93b84793d07a5abc5": "", "8f6185930aa1aa52f9323bed257879dae15333dc5d250678926d6ab4": "", "e648dafae11a4a40488b5dba219ac42e8d50fe3814f60f7a6174159a": "", "caddc317ee0a8f3da2455349e07a846229a3199fc852a895212ba993": "", "63a19f171e9c5cfa474ef753739ddf3bf07d8b6a1657601f272846d8": "", "66a82b4442043680384b0f7b2c955b8dfa5ba2f00d3069ab847405c6": "", "f38979e0740ef208a662ab16de61dac5bfc75489730240965aa7d2e4": "", "a808c93374b72809c0429f255152f81ae37b43eea7a56e57fba33d3c": "", "b16df422044acef3ada577f02e328858fa0936a779d9746241e20a32": "", "fcdd77f071c4bed92561face3cb88080f37c7bcbb0c1b7b3002a625b": "", "5b422b00a8125e003d9760eb7c878b27f58a043131302b73a4b7fea8": "", "4f6dada71e3ea9027121e29a15c00c5119308fbf7b5be3152cdefa14": "", "112f727d7fca4d350533fd72c33a48afaed4253bdd75b7cbced96948": "", "ab8ee959bd5608e34ad77af8b29058356b1c3e1fb181ec0765be75e4": "The services listed on the billboard outside Rotondaro Costruzioni, an estate agency and builder, are written in Italian and Russian, as are the details of the properties advertised for sale in the window display. Inside, about a dozen thick red folders, filled with plastic envelopes containing details of customers dating back to 2010, spill out of a cabinet. The majority of those property buyers were Russian. A short distance away is a stretch of Italy's southern Calabrian coastline lapped by clear-blue sea. This is not the glitzy Costa Smeralda in Sardinia or Tuscany's Forte dei Marmi, where lavish villas and yachts belonging to Russian oligarchs have been seized over the last two months, but Scalea, a low-profile holiday resort with a medieval hilltop village whose economy has flourished over the past decade, partly thanks to the ordinary Russians who flocked here for the cheap property and sunshine. Nicola Rotondaro, the company's owner, is finalising the sale of another property, a one-bedroom apartment worth EUR22,000 (PS19,000), to a young Russian-Ukrainian man living near Naples. He is not in good spirits, however. The presence of Russian buyers and holidaymakers in Scalea had already all but evaporated as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the unauthorised status of the Russian Sputnik vaccine in the EU. Now the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent economic sanctions, especially a ban on flights, means the Russians are unlikely to return for the foreseeable future. 'We are already at zero,' said Rotondaro. 'The Russians don't come any more; they've been cut off.' Rotondaro is not the only one feeling the pinch. Scalea, a town of just under 11,000 residents, has about 30 property agencies, many catering to the Russian market. Restaurants, bars and shops had come to depend on their Russian guests, who tend to spend more than their Italian counterparts while elongating the holiday season by visiting outside the hot summer months. La Playa, a spacious bar and restaurant, has menus in Russian and Russian-speaking staff, but when the Guardian visited at lunchtime on a recent national holiday, there were few diners. 'In normal situations, there are lots of Russians here. Now there is not even one,' said Salvatore, a waiter. 'And they spend a lot. If the war ends soon, maybe they'll return in time for the summer.' Property-building boomed in Scalea, and other towns along Calabria's coastline, in the 1980s, driven by demand for holiday homes from Italian buyers, mostly from Naples. 'You could count the number of foreigners on one hand,' said Tony Hackett, a British-Italian property agent. 'But then people who bought during that period stopped coming, and so a lot of property has been recycled.' Interest from Russians started to gather pace from about 2010. They were schoolteachers, professors and doctors, snapping up humble properties that even today can be bought for as little as EUR14,000. The most famous Russian property owner in Scalea was Boris Klyuyev, an actor who died in 2020. Some of the property owners have settled in the town, including Maria Stepura, the president of the Calabria-Russia association, which helps to promote Calabria in Russia and assists property buyers with Italian bureaucracy. Stepura bought a home close to the beach in 2010. 'The value of the rouble at the time meant it cost much less than buying land near Moscow,' she said. Buyers with enough savings would purchase a property outright; others would obtain loans from Russian banks. 'Life here is simple: you have a beautiful beach, the cost of living is cheap, you can eat out cheaply and have breakfast at the bar, which is always a pleasure, and the locals are welcoming,' Stepura said. Scalea has been described by the local press as 'a little Moscow in Calabria', but Giacomo Perrotta, the mayor since August 2020, begs to differ. 'Yes, there has been significant investment from Russia - obviously Scalea is different from Moscow for those who like the sun,' he said. 'But we also have other communities - Polish, Romanian, and Ukrainian. Recently we held a march for peace, and everyone participated, Russians and Ukrainians. As a population, we are well integrated.' The property boom in areas of Calabria was partly fuelled by illegal building by mafia groups, with a crackdown since 2013 leading to the seizure of hundreds of tourist resorts and holiday homes. Some foreign investors became unwittingly entangled in the mafia's real-estate crimes. Scalea has not been left unscathed, and now the local administration is hoping to put properties confiscated from the mafia on to the market. 'We're participating in a competition for funding, so that is the first step - to have the funds to tidy them up,' said Perrotta. It remains to be seen if Russians will return to buy the additional property stock, but Perrotta is confident that Scalea is in for a busy summer. 'We will wait for the Russians to come back ... but after two years of the pandemic, we anticipate a boom in tourist presence - we don't only live off Russians; we have plenty of Italian visitors too.'", "e54fc8fae355ec80bce8f4dcd0b8fb114f0ef6dfcac3a3259eefb99d": "", "9696edfb68460672c581f9688d5f395254444babdc51f2a5cdc1426b": "The peat sods lay spread on a field, at the end of which was a mound of earth the colour of dark chocolate. It was the edge of a bog, a habitat thousands of years in the making. A mechanised cutter with steel claws had gouged and sliced some of it into chunks that now covered an area the size of a football pitch. Enough, once dried and bagged, to heat a house for an Irish winter. Some environmentalists would consider this tableau in County Kildare - one replicated across rural Ireland at this time of year - akin to a crime scene, a mad, destructive assault on a precious natural resource, turning a carbon sink into a smoky fuel. Ned Phillips, 49, who did the gouging, disagreed. 'I'll not stop cutting turf here no matter what law they pass. It's our tradition. We're doing no harm here.' It was his mother's dying wish that he continue a tradition dating back centuries, a wish he intends to honour, even though the family's patch of bog is now part of a conservation area. 'I'll fight till my death.' Fiona Conlon, a fellow turf cutter, appealed for understanding. 'People think we're being thugs or radicals. We're not heathens. It's pride. We believe in what we do. My home feels like home because of the turf fire. The warmth and the glow - that's a real sense of comfort.' Ireland's government, in contrast, is feeling a scorching burn. An attempt to curb the sale and distribution of turf, also known as peat, has backfired, triggering uproar in parliament, splitting the ruling coalition and fuelling a narrative of urban elites versus rural poor. Eamon Ryan, the Green party leader and environment minister, has been forced into a partial retreat. The taoiseach, Micheal Martin, said there would be no ban on turf sales this year. In policy terms curbing the commercial cutting and burning of turf was supposed to be 'low hanging fruit', an overdue crackdown on a practice harmful to health and the environment. Instead, it turned into a cautionary tale about populism, energy prices, Vladimir Putin and just transition to a green economy, a combustible nexus that is playing out across much of Europe. Soggy peatlands formed by the accumulation of decayed vegetation cover much of Ireland's midlands. Lacking coal and woods, not to mention electricity, Irish people survived for centuries by draining bogs and using peat as fuel. Storytelling by a blazing hearth embodied the national identity. From the 1930s a semi-state company, Bord na Mona, extracted peat on an industrial scale, a source of patriotic pride. In the 1990s attitudes began to change. Fuel peat is more damaging than coal, generating less energy when burned while producing higher carbon emissions. Burning smoky fuels was banned in Dublin to reduce winter smog, though has been allowed to continue in many smaller towns and rural areas. In 2018 Bord na Mona announced it was closing 17 of its 'active bogs' and would close the remaining 45 to commercial harvesting within seven years. Families, thought to number several thousand, that live near the remaining bogs are still allowed to cut turf for domestic use in accordance with traditional 'turbary rights'. Commercial contractors with mechanical equipment do the cutting for many such families and sell the surplus with little or no regulation or taxation. About 100,000 households, many in old, draughty dwellings, use turf for heating, according to some estimates. Every hectare of drained peatland emits two tonnes of carbon per annum. Peat, along with imported coal and other smoky fuels, is also blamed for air pollution that kills 1,300 people each year. Successive governments have tried and failed to rein in commercial turf operators. 'It's a real political failure to tackle a very stinging nettle,' said Seamus Boland, head of Irish Rural Link, an advocacy group for disadvantaged areas. One reason is cultural. 'There is a lot of emotional attachment to turf burning,' said John Sweeney, a climate expert and geography professor at Maynooth University. 'The idea that you can't have a home without a blazing hearth is something we have to get over in Ireland. We have to recognise the damage far exceeds the emotional benefits.' The other reason is financial. Contractors risk losing livelihoods. Families that heat homes with peat fear retrofitting, with costs of thousands of euros, and a switch to much pricier alternative energy sources. 'I don't want to destroy the whole world but I don't want to be poor either,' said John Dore, 62, who lives by the country's largest raised bog, the Bog of Allen in County Kildare. Soaring global energy costs and uncertainty over Russia's oil and gas exports to western Europe have strengthened the conviction of Dore, a spokesperson for the Kildare Turf Cutters Association, to keep burning turf. 'I never felt so happy to have a shed full of turf. I don't care what Putin does with his gas, we're independent.' Other turf advocates also feel emboldened. 'We are a small country at the end of a very small line when it comes to gas or diesel. When we have a fuel source of our own now is not the time to attack it. Jesus, it doesn't make sense at all,' said Michael Fitzmaurice, an independent member of the Dail (Ireland's lower house of parliament) and chair of the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association. There is consensus in Ireland that the climate crisis is real - deniers get no traction. Nor do populists, as a rule. However, the battle over turf has exposed rural grievances that echo supporters of anti-establishment politicians in Britain, the continent and the US. For Ryan, the environment minister, turf should have been just a skirmish on the way to bigger battles over farming, transport and renewable energy that will determine Ireland's struggling climate action plan. He targeted commercial contractors, not households, who retained the right to cut and share turf. Yet the Dail erupted, with independent rural deputies and the main opposition party, Sinn Fein, accusing the government of violating traditional rights and condemning people to fuel poverty. Ryan's coalition partners also turned on him. Leo Varadkar, the Fine Gael leader and tanaiste, or deputy prime minister, said removing turf cutting from rural Ireland was like removing pasta from Italians or wine from the French. The comment drew widespread criticism. 'The production of wine and pasta doesn't kill people. It's a very misleading analogy,' said Sweeney, the climate expert. 'The debate has been twisted,' said Tristram Whyte, of the Irish Peatland Conservation Council. He said contractors and some politicians were muddying things by suggesting grandmothers could be arrested for burning a bit of peat. Florence Renou-Wilson, a research scientist and peatland expert at University College Dublin, said the science was clear. Bogs, when left intact, benefited the climate, biodiversity and human health. Peat extraction 'bled out' bogs, degrading air and water quality and emitting carbon. 'It has all these bad local and global effects. It's not rocket science; people have understood this is a precious resource for their community.' The state should pay turf cutters to restore bogs and fund retrofitting of homes that rely on turf for heating, said Renou-Wilson. 'This is a resource that has been mismanaged. We need to get our act together.' Boland, the head of Irish Rural Link, agreed. 'The only way to stop turf burning is to provide a way for households to change their systems.' There is a government scheme to retrofit 500,000 homes by 2030, with an additional scheme for households in energy poverty, but delays have created a backlog. There is another obstacle. Many turf cutters eye authority with suspicion. Just as storytellers of old chronicled resistance to landlords and redcoats, today's turf cutters weave their own story. Previous governments have sought to take control of bogs with compulsory purchase orders and compensation schemes, only to break their promises, they claim. Some openly cut turf in special areas of conservation despite aerial surveillance and regular warning letters to desist. 'I'm not worried about it but it's threat after threat after threat - your head is just so fried with it,' said Colm Higgins, 56, a plasterer who cuts in Mouds Bog, a protected part of the Bog of Allen. 'It's the wildlife crowd flexing their muscles and hoping we'll go away. We're not going away.' His partner, Fiona Conlon, an IT tutor, said Irish governments had surrendered the sugar beet industry, fishing rights and other assets to European diktats. 'Now it's turf. We're being left with nothing. It's like they don't want you to own anything or have a sense of independence.' It wasn't about heating or even money, it was about identity, said Conlon. People helped one another cut turf, competed for the best sods, had some craic - it was a way of life, she said. 'It's part of our heritage. I love the bog. You're out in the fresh air getting exercise, you're with your neighbours. It's your own tradition and pride and I feel that's being robbed from us. I have forefathers and foremothers that fought for this country. We're not going to roll over.'", "efa3d794a6a3e8568ea69a631180b48251d1a281f3c00effa682b533": "The debate over whether Britain should introduce a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas companies has been reignited by bumper profits at BP. The one-off levy is among a suite of measures that have been proposed to tackle the energy crisis, which has sent household bills soaring. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated existing supply problems and left governments across Europe scrambling to protect consumers from the cost of living crunch. The Centre for Economics and Business Research has estimated that, without government intervention, energy costs could increase by 40% across the eurozone in 2022, up from a 13% rise in 2021. Deliberations over sanctions on Russian energy supplies and measures to limit the fallout of the conflict continue in Europe. In the UK, analysts have said bills could reach as much as PS3,000 a year in October, when the price cap is due to go up again, if wholesale gas prices do not fall. Here is how different governments across Europe have reacted. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been repeatedly criticised for acting slowly on tackling the energy crisis. The government has so far resisted calls from Labour and the Liberal Democrats to introduce a windfall tax on the profits of North Sea oil and gas operators, arguing that it would discourage investment in domestic energy supplies. In February, Sunak said 28m households will receive a PS200 discount on their bills from October. The cost will be recovered over the next five years. Ministers rejected calls for a cut on the 5% VAT rate on energy bills in favour of a one-off rebate of PS150 for households in England in council tax bands A-D. A further PS144m has been set aside to support vulnerable people and those on low incomes. The Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, on Monday laid out a EUR14bn (PS11.8bn) support package to tackle energy costs. His measures include subsidies for vulnerable families and a EUR200 cash payment for pensioners and those on low incomes. Draghi also found extra funds for local governments and will offer tax credits for energy-intensive industries. The measures come on top of the EUR20bn the cash-strapped nation has already spent on cushioning the impact of the energy price rise. The initiatives will be funded by a hike in Italy's windfall tax, introduced in January. The levy on energy industry profits will rise to 25% from 10%. Economists have warned that a sudden halt to Russian gas would trigger a 'sharp recession' in Germany. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has promised 'tangible relief' to citizens and last week unveiled a EUR30bn collection of measures. These include a temporary reduction in fuel taxes and cheaper, 90-day tickets to make public transport more affordable. The move builds on an existing EUR15bn relief package which involved an increase in the tax-free allowance for long-distance commuters. Berlin has also fast-tracked a revamp of legislation from 1975 aimed at handling energy shocks. The reworked bill will include measures to shut down companies during a gas shortage and strengthen EU security of supply regulations. Rules brought in five years ago state that EU members must help one another when gas supplies are tight. Spain's government was one of the first to take action to protect households against a sharp rise in energy bills. It agreed last September to remove taxes from home energy bills, which would instead be paid by enforcing a windfall tax on companies profiting from the surge in energy prices. A string of other measures have followed, including a ban on increasing gas bills by more than 5% for customers with lower energy consumption. Last week the European Commission agreed a price cap on gas for Spain and Portugal for 12 months. Consumers have been helped by a cut to VAT on energy bills and a reduction in a separate tax on electricity. Emmanuel Macron made energy policy a key pillar in his successful presidential re-election campaign. He said he would make France 'the first major nation to abandon gas, oil and coal' ahead of his win last month. In the short term, the French government has forced majority state-owned electricity supplier EDF Energy to lower costs. The operator, which is behind the Hinkley Point B nuclear power plant in the UK, told investors it would take a EUR8.4bn hit from the energy price cap, which meant it lowered the cost of electricity below the market rate. Electricity taxes have been reduced for households and businesses. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has estimated government efforts to curb costs since the Ukraine invasion are worth about EUR25bn. The Polish government has urged European counterparts to impose tough sanctions on Russia's oil and gas industry after gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland were cut last week by the Russian energy giant Gazprom. Both countries have said there is no immediate risk to supplies. Polish ministers have repeatedly intervened since late last year to protect households from the energy price hike. The prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, introduced an 'anti-inflation shield', cutting VAT on food and gas to 0%. A wider economic package, dubbed the 'anti-Putin shield', is being rolled out to support companies and jobs. The Dutch government was swift to act as the energy crisis began to escalate last year. Last October, energy taxes were cut for households and EUR150m was allocated to boosting home insulation. In March, the government raised a one-off energy allowance for low-income households by EUR600 to EUR800. The government has also lowered VAT on energy from 21% to 9% until the end of the year. Excise duties on petrol and diesel have been cut for the rest of 2022. In December, Norway's government set out a series of measures to help households totalling more than 8bn kroner (PS664m). Last month its parliament agreed an extension to a support scheme to tackle high electricity prices, worth EUR850m through to March 2023. Support for students and widows has also been ramped up. Sweden began introducing policies to tackle the energy crisis at the start of the year. These extended to compensation for households with high energy usage and fuel duty cuts. The government has also offered EUR6,700 in support for buying electric vehicles. Sweden is also expected to spend EUR48m on a housing allowance for families with children.", "291dd1a47a0cbf5303c01e2046e6c28cd4a3b8638ef9ccfaa73e169e": "In February 2022, a Dutch-owned fishing trawler released a silvery stream of 100,000 dead fish, which carpeted several thousand square metres of ocean off the coast of France. The vessel's owners blamed the discharge on a faulty net. Environmental groups alleged that the fish were intentionally dumped. Whatever the truth, that spectacle of squandered sea life was the tip of the iceberg: figures from WWF show that in 2019, at least 230,000 tonnes of fish were dumped in EU waters. Most of the waste - 92% - is related to bottom-trawling, a fishing method that scrapes the seafloor, indiscriminately scooping up everything in its path. But this figure is a small fraction of an even larger global issue. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 35% of all fish, crustaceans and molluscs harvested from oceans, lakes and fish farms are wasted or lost before they ever reach a plate. Fish are highly perishable and fragile, which makes them more vulnerable to waste, a problem that is compounded by haemorrhaging fish at every step of the supply chain. Fish waste is especially shocking, says Pete Pearson, senior director for food waste at WWF, because they 'are wild animals, so we are harvesting wildlife'. Fish populations are already threatened by overfishing, pollution, and the climate crisis. With current rates of fish consumption projected to double by 2050, waste is increasingly on the radar of regulators. 'We have to do something about it,' says Omar Penarubia, a fisheries officer at the FAO. That begins, experts say, with understanding exactly what is driving waste between harvest and plate. The task is made difficult by fisheries' notoriously opaque supply chains, and incomplete datasets that are also inconsistent, although the evidence is clear that most fish waste starts at the point of extraction. Just under half of all fish consumed by people is wild-caught at sea. 'There's such abundance that we've grown to be OK with certain loss rates,' Pearson says, although noting that 34% of global marine stocks are now overfished. Bycatch (unintentionally caught, unwanted fish) is a growing problem, too: roughly 10% of wild-caught fish are discarded worldwide each year, representing 8.6m tonnes of animals. The main culprits are imprecise fishing gear and policies that allow fishers to discard non-target species. There's an economic driver, too. 'I think there is a strong connection between subsidies and waste in the water,' says Rashid Sumaila, professor of ocean and fisheries economics at the University of British Columbia. Although subsidies were historically devised to support small-scale fishers, today 80% of $35.4bn (PS26.4bn) in annual fishing subsidies goes to a handful of industrial fleets, Sumaila's research shows. These include gargantuan bottom trawlers that are uniquely equipped to travel out to the high seas and overfish, leading to discards on an industrial scale. The impact of illegal and unreported fishing is also important, says Sumaila, as it is likely contributing tonnes more bycatch to global fish waste. Fish waste is about more than just the physical loss of fish: for the 3 billion people whose diets depend on fish, it is a lost nutritional opportunity. 'The narrative is that we have to produce more to feed the growing masses, but the greatest pathway to [increasing] supply is reducing loss and waste,' says Shakuntala Thilsted, global lead for nutrition and public health at World Fish and winner of the 2021 World Food Prize. Many see controlled aquaculture systems (or 'fish farms') - which generate more than half our fish supply - as a solution to the waste of wild fishing. But Dave Love, senior scientist at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future, says that various factors, such as disease, are driving considerable losses on farms, too. 'Mortality in fish ponds is actually a significant source of lost potential food,' Love says. Fish waste continues after harvest - though how it unfolds differs depending on location. The FAO estimates that 27% of all fish globally is lost or wasted after landing, but in low-income countries the fish is more likely to be unintentionally lost than wasted, says Penarubia. One study showed that in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Togo, 65% of lost fish on land was attributable to poor handling, lack of storage and cooling facilities on fishing vessels and along the lengthy supply chain.  Fish disappear after distribution, too, but here the culprits are retailers and consumers, almost exclusively in middle-and high-income countries. In North America, Oceania and Europe, fish waste at consumption far outstrips that of any other region in the world. Pearson thinks retailers in the US partly contribute to the problem by prioritising large, fresh fish to sell at a premium, which quickly spoil. 'This is the real tragedy, because it's moved all the way through the supply chain, and then we're comfortable with a 10% to 30% loss rate in the grocery store,' he says. When retailers prioritise fresh fish, 'the ripple effect is that consumers are more likely to waste that in their homes,' says Love, who published research showing that retailers were responsible for about 16% of wasted seafood in the US, while up to 63% comes down to consumers putting uneaten fish in the bin. Solutions do exist to reduce fish spoilage along the supply chain. Increasing access to cold-chain technologies in low-income countries, along with methods such as solar-powered drying tents, could extend the shelf life of fish. Fishers and processors also need training on better fish handling and storage to limit loss, Penarubia says. At the consumer end, Pearson and Love argue that we should encourage more people to opt for frozen fish, which could reduce demand for fresh fish in grocery stores, and limit the amount that is lost in retail and people's homes. Thilsted suggests diversifying our appetites beyond the ubiquitous fish fillet to smaller fish and bivalves, which can be consumed whole to reduce waste. 'If our notion of 'fish' is a fillet on a pan, then we are already far down the path of loss and waste, because we have reduced the edible part to such a small portion of the whole.' Existing fish byproducts can be captured and turned into new ones. Fish heads, fins, and bones from the fishing industry are already a source of fertiliser and feed; now innovators are finding uses for everything from fish skin for burn treatments, and crustacean waste to make biodegradable packaging. 'The idea of full utilisation is something that needs to be pervasive across all food supply chains' says Pearson, who cautions, however, that we shouldn't overstate these solutions. Unless fish byproducts replace a share of fish demand, they are simply making use of waste - not reducing it at source. Ultimately, prevention is the best solution, starting at sea, where this problem begins, Pearson says. Fishers need to be equipped with more selective gear for fishing, and aided by policies that discourage discards. Sumaila underscores the need for 'good subsidies' that can be channelled towards fisheries that help replenish wild stocks: 'We need to spend taxpayers' money in ways that reinforce positive feedback from people to nature, and nature to people,' he says. For generations we've believed 'the ocean is huge, and we can just take whatever we want,' says Pearson. 'Now we're coming to see the limits of that. And when you have limits, it requires you to become more efficient.'", "0e3c2945ffec7c2745101236cf567c39f45572322db688178bce1119": "It has already been a very wet autumn in eastern Australia. Now further heavy rain will bring the potential for flooding in the north-east of the country over the next few days. La Nina has been the main driver behind the wet weather across Australia during what is autumn in the southern hemisphere. During a La Nina event, the sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific are colder than normal, meaning that the usual easterly winds across the equator are strengthened. The result of this is that more moisture is fed into north-eastern parts of Australia in particular, with an increase in associated heavy rainfall events. This is what has been seen for much of the last couple of months in Australia, after Brisbane on the east coast broke its three-day and seven-day rainfall records back in the last week of February. Low pressure has and will continue to affect northern parts of Australia, with east or north-easterly winds feeding in from the Pacific, helping to seed heavy rain. Some parts of central Queensland recorded 100-150mm of rainfall on Monday. And the north-east coast between Townsville and Yeppoon could get 150-200mm quite widely in the 24 hours to 6am on Wednesday, with the potential locally for 200-300mm as the low pressure system moves eastwards out into the Pacific. This level of rainfall is likely to lead to widespread flooding in this area. This area of low pressure is expected to sink southwards down the east coast over the next few days and although the intensity of rain will ease, the system will bring some strong winds down the east coast with the potential for gusts to exceed 50mph. Meanwhile, the intense heatwave across India is expected to continue through the rest of this week with temperatures perhaps exceeding 50C in some northern areas. In stark contrast, farther east across China temperatures will remain well below average over the next few days. A persistent north-easterly wind will keep daytime maximum temperatures in the teens rather than the mid to high 20s celsius expected at this time of year.", "e475e5d56d8ba563e35f8e8dd3d5015dadfedc3d8e8c75945b5fd67a": "Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon surged to record levels for the month of April, nearly doubling the area of forest removed in that month last year - the previous April record - preliminary government data has shown, alarming environmental campaigners. In the first 29 days of April, deforestation in the region totalled 1,012.5 square km (390 square miles), according to data from national space research agency Inpe on Friday. The agency, which has compiled the monthly data series since 2015/2016, will report data for the final day of April next week. April is the third monthly record this year, after new highs were also observed in January and February. Destruction of the Brazilian Amazon in the first four months of the year also hit a record for the period of 1,954 square km (754 square miles), an increase of 69% compared to the same period of 2021, clearing an area more than double the size of New York City. Deforestation in the Amazon has soared since rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019 and weakened environmental protection. Bolsonaro argues that more farming and mining in the Amazon will reduce poverty in the region. 'The cause of this record has a first and last name: Jair Messias Bolsonaro,' said Marcio Astrini, head of Brazilian advocacy group Climate Observatory, in a statement. Bolsonaro's office directed questions to the ministries of environment and justice. The ministries said in a joint statement the government was making major efforts to fight environmental crimes and that police and environmental authorities were cooperating on an operation to combat deforestation in five Amazon states. Even with deforestation already on the rise, Climate Observatory said its analysts were astounded by such a high reading in April, which is part of the rainy season when the muddy forest is harder for loggers to access. Preservation of the Amazon is vital to stopping catastrophic climate change because of the vast amount of climate-warming carbon dioxide it absorbs. Ane Alencar, science director of the Amazon Environmental Research Institute , said she had expected deforestation to keep rising ahead of the October presidential election, like it has in Brazil's past three election years, as officials wary of angering voters generally do less to enforce the law. Still, she called the surge in deforestation last month 'absurd.' 'It seems that the clearing of forests has become institutionalised in the country as something common, with record after record,' Alencar said.", "bf84e94ea8c54219e03909276c67d326ac1011169722b5d1aaa29d12": "The British government approved payments of up to PS60m to a future king of Saudi Arabia, his son and other high-ranking officials as part of a huge arms deal and then sought to conceal them in what it described as a 'deniable fiddle', a trial has heard. Opening the defence of one of two men accused of corruption in the arms deal, Ian Winter QC told Southwark crown court that some of the payments were made to the then Prince Abdullah, who later became the Saudi monarch for a decade. Winter also told the court that internal documents recorded that the British government and Abdullah organised 'a deniable fiddle' to hide the payments. The QC also alleged that the British government ensured payments continued to be paid to high-ranking Saudis until 2020 - eight years after the Serious Fraud Office began an investigation into the same payments. Winter is representing Jeffrey Cook, 65, who, along with John Mason, 79, is being prosecuted by the SFO for authorising corrupt payments amounting to PS7.9m to senior Saudis between 2007 and 2012. The payments were made, according to the SFO, to ensure that a British firm, GPT, received lucrative contracts from the Saudi military. Cook, a former Ministry of Defence civil servant, was GPT's managing director. Mason worked for an offshore firm, Simec, that is accused of funnelling the bribes to the Saudis. The contracts awarded to GPT were part of a large arms deal managed as a formal agreement between the UK and Saudi governments that had started in the 1970s. Winter told the court the British government decided in 1978 that large payments had to be paid personally to Abdullah, then a prince, to ensure that the British won the original arms deal. This was a 'fundamental necessity without which the contract would not have been awarded to the British', he added. He said the British government 'decided that it was in the public interest, bearing in mind the value of the ... contract, to enter into a binding contractual agreement with Prince Abdullah' to be given the payments. He alleged that Abdullah and the MoD organised the original deal on the basis of what the MoD 'called at the time, 'the deniable fiddle'. They actually recorded that phrase in reports and file notes at the time.' Winter said 'both Prince Abdullah and the British government wanted a deniable fiddle that would enable the payments to be made, but which would permit them to deny their involvement through the use of a private contractor'. In recent years, the role of private contractor had been performed by GPT. He said 'very senior' officials in the British government approved every penny of the payments that were made as part of the arms deal in what at one stage was called 'top cover'. This included the money paid to Abdullah, and more recently his son Prince Miteb, and other high-ranking officials. Abdullah died in 2015 after 10 years on the Saudi throne. He alleged that the UK government facilitated the payments amounting to PS60m to be made from the late 1970s to 2020, when GPT's contracts ended. The SFO began its investigation into GPT in 2012 after complaints from whistleblowers. Winter told Mr Justice Bryan that 'even after the prosecution's balloon had gone up ... the MoD set about working on creating a new system that did not involve GPT having to make the' payments to senior Saudis. He alleged that the payments were moved through an offshore route by the MoD. He added that legally, the payments did not amount to corruption if the Saudi and British governments had authorised them.

The paper beat two other finalists: the New York Times, for challenging official accounts of US military engagements in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, for an expose of electrical fires in city rental operations. The Pulitzers, administered by Columbia University in New York and considered the most prestigious prizes in US journalism, recognise work in 15 journalism categories and seven arts categories. The winner of the public service award receives a gold medal. Winners of other categories get $15,000. A bipartisan Senate committee linked seven deaths to the assault on the Capitol, which happened after Trump told supporters to 'fight like hell' to overturn his election defeat by Joe Biden. The attack did not succeed in stopping certification of Biden's victory. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection. The impeachment was the most bipartisan ever but the former president was acquitted when enough Senate Republicans stayed loyal. Trump therefore remains free to run for the White House again. A House committee is preparing for public hearings in its investigation of the riot, which has produced a charge of criminal contempt of Congress against Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist. Bannon has pleaded not guilty. More than 800 people have been charged over the Capitol attack, some, members of a far-right militia, with seditious conspiracy. Announcing the prize, the administrator of the Pulitzer prizes, Marjorie Miller, saluted the Post for its 'compellingly told and vividly presented account of the assault on Washington ... providing the public with a thorough understanding of one of the nation's darkest days'. Sally Buzzbee, executive editor of the Post, said: 'There is nothing more central to the American experiment than democracy ... in 2021, that democracy came under attack from within. 'The challenge for the fourth estate was clear: we were no longer just a watchdog of the institutions and elected leaders of our democracy, but an indispensable defender of democracy itself.' Buzzbee also saluted 'more than 100' of her journalists for 'fearless, consistent and comprehensive work ... read and watched by millions [and] cited in congressional investigations'. The intersection of health, safety and infrastructure played a prominent role among other winning projects. The Tampa Bay Times won the investigative reporting award for Poisoned, an in-depth look into a polluting lead factory. The paper's editor and vice-president, Mark Katches, said the win was 'a testament to the importance of a vital local newsroom like the Times'. The Miami Herald took the breaking news award for its work covering the deadly Surfside condo tower collapse, while the Better Government Association and the Chicago Tribune won the local reporting award for Deadly Fires, Broken Promises, an examination of a lack of enforcement of fire safety standards. The Miami Herald's executive editor, Monica Richardson, said: 'As a newsroom, we poured our hearts into the breaking news and the ongoing daily coverage, and subsequent investigative coverage, of the Champlain Towers South condominium collapse story. 'It was our story to tell because the people and the families in Surfside who were impacted by this unthinkable tragedy are a part of our community.' The Pulitzer prizes also awarded a special citation to journalists from Ukraine, acknowledging their 'courage, endurance and commitment' in covering the Russian invasion. Last August, the Pulitzer board granted a special citation to Afghan journalists who help produce news and images from their own war-torn country. In the arts categories, Joshua Cohen won the fiction prize with The Netanyahus: An Account of a Minor and Ultimately Even Negligible Episode in the History of a Very Famous Family. Inspired by the story of the former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's father trying to get a job in academia, it won the 2021 National Jewish Book Award for Fiction. In the Guardian, Leo Robson called the novel 'utterly immersive'.

'At the risk of stating the obvious, unless something changes to cause the birthrate to exceed the death rate, Japan will eventually cease to exist. This would be a great loss for the world,' the Tesla chief executive, who recently agreed a deal to buy Twitter for $44bn (PS36bn), said in a post at the weekend. Musk, who has previously voiced concern about global population collapse, was responding to government data showing that Japan's population fell by a record 644,000 last year - the 11th consecutive year of decline. Some social media users said Japan was not the only developed economy experiencing long-term population decline, but others used Musk's tweet to criticise successive governments' half-hearted attempts to raise the birthrate in the world's third-biggest economy. Japan's population peaked in 2008 and had fallen to about 125 million by last year, despite government warnings about the effect on economic growth and occasional campaigns to encourage couples to have bigger families. Some Japan experts took Musk to task over his tweet. 'What is even the point of tweeting this?' wrote Tobias Harris, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. 'The anxieties surrounding Japan's demographic future is not that 'Japan will eventually cease to exist' but rather the profound social dislocations that are occurring as a result of the decline to a lower population level.' Others called on the Japanese government to further relax the country's strict rules on immigration, although plans to admit up to half a million blue-collar workers by 2025 to address serious labour shortages have been frustrated by the coronavirus pandemic. There were also calls to address the low birthrate, including making it easier for women to return to work after having children. 'They keep saying the birthrate's falling, but given that the government isn't taking thorough steps to deal with it, what can we say?' one Twitter user said. 'Everything they say and do is contradictory. 'In this environment, who's going to say 'OK, let's have a child'? I despair for Japan.' Experts blame Japan's low birthrate on several factors, including the high financial cost of bringing up children, the lack of childcare provision and notoriously long working hours.

The worst-affected area is the province of Nuoro, where the winged insects have decimated crops across 25,000 hectares (62,000 acres) of land, following swarms in 2019 said to be the worst in decades and further infestations in 2020 and 2021. Leonardo Salis, the president of the Nuoro unit of Coldiretti, the Italian farmers' association, said their passage destroyed the crops of an entire field, sending months of farmers' work and investments 'up in smoke'. The locusts are also wrecking vegetable gardens. Salis said that after three years of complaints and proposals to authorities to tackle the insects, 'we are shocked that we still find ourselves talking about the invasion of locusts'. He added: 'Farmers are now disillusioned and this year some changed their crop plan in order to try and limit the damage because they knew nothing would change. Among other things, they have not yet received a euro to compensate for the damage suffered.' Gabriella Murgia, the island's councillor for agriculture, said on Monday that an anti-locust taskforce was working unabated. 'There is no time to lose,' she told the local press, adding that the team, together with forestry workers, was identifying the worst-affected areas and accelerating pest control operations. 'The maximum collaboration of farmers and all other interested parties is required,' she said. The infestation comes days after regional authorities approved EUR2m (PS1.7m) in compensation to farmers whose crops were damaged by the insects in 2021. Christian Solinas, the president of Sardinia, told L'Unione Sarda newspaper: 'The invasion of locusts devastated the Nuoro countryside, bringing several companies to their knees. Compensation is essential to allow farmers to cope with a sharp decline in their income, guaranteeing concrete support in the face of an emergency that has added to their difficulties of recent years.'", "5a68b076b7a4fb0950685ca38a2243ce4626823124d92befa5dcdafc": "An Italian parliamentary committee has begun an investigation into the spread of disinformation, reportedly amid suspicions that some Russian commentators hosted on television networks could be on Vladimir Putin's payroll. The probe by Copasir, a parliamentary committee for the security of Italy, was triggered after an outcry over a recent interview with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Rete 4, a channel operated by the privately owned Mediaset. Enrico Borghi, a member of Copasir and politician with the centre-left Democratic party, confirmed an investigation was under way but would neither confirm nor deny a report in la Repubblica on Monday that at least three unnamed Russian guests on Italian TV were on the Kremlin's payroll. Lavrov's interview on 1 May, prompted a diplomatic row with Israel after the minister claimed that Adolf Hitler 'had Jewish blood'. The screening coincided with the appearance of the prominent pro-Kremlin journalist, Vladimir Solovyev, on the rival channel, La7. 'The fact they were both interviewed on the same night, by private networks, was really quite striking,' Borghi said. 'But this investigation is not about censorship or limiting press freedom, but this so-called hybrid war of disinformation, interference, the production of fake news and influence, which are objective themes of Russian activities against Nato, and, in particular, against Italy. These elements have increased, unfortunately, in connection with the real war.' The committee will first hear Carlo Fuortes, CEO of the state-owned broadcaster, Rai, on 12 May, followed by Giacomo Lasorella, president of the media watchdog, Agcom, on 17 May. 'Our task is to supervise the information service and security of the country. It's in the context of this activity that we carry out our work,' added Borghi. Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Rai and other TV channels have regularly hosted Russian journalists to debate the war, sparking divisions between those who condemn the networks for giving space to 'propagandists' and those who argue that it is right to air the opinions of those on both sides of the conflict. The matter came to a head when Lavrov was interviewed on Rete 4's current affairs programme, Zona bianca, during which he dismissed the massacre in Bucha as fake news and accused the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is Jewish, of being a Nazi. It was the first interview Lavrov had given to a European TV network since the beginning of the war. 'It seems we are the only country whose talkshows host Russian figures every day,' said Riccardo Magi, a politician with the small leftwing party, Piu Europa, said. 'Probably, in their evaluation [Italy] has a major weakness, both from the point of view of the authoritativeness of independent information and public opinion; already this type of propaganda had been well infiltrated.'", "6a6a937e17968680b45860c5b20705e72d7fe05cc583e9ce2a3157e2": "Lee Ming-che and his wife, Ching-yu, sit side by side at an ornate round table, wearing matching crisp white shirts with pages of notes in front of them. The couple have plenty to say after a five-year campaign to free Lee from a Chinese prison. Now in his late 40s, Lee is visibly slimmer than in photos of his appearance in a Chinese court in late 2017. His hair is thinner and greyer, his brow a little furrowed. Over the course of an hour-long interview, he and his wife stay close, touching or holding each other's hands and faces, sharing looks between them as if to catch up on those lost in the half decade, smiling in seeming disbelief at hearing each other's voice. 'I feel I can breathe in the fresh air of freedom, and I'm happy to be reunited with family again,' Lee says. His sudden return to Taipei last week, after serving five years in China's Chishan prison on charges of subversion, made headlines across Taiwan. His disappearance in early 2017 and subsequent sentence had sparked international campaigns for his freedom and further soured relations between Taiwan and China. The case echoed that of Hong Kong's Causeway Bay booksellers less than two years earlier, and chilled those who travelled to China holding views unfavourable to the Communist party. Lee is a human rights activist, a community college administrator and a former member of Taiwanese political parties including the Democratic Progressive party (DPP). In March 2017 he was on his way to China to meet a friend, travelling via Macau to cross into the mainland at Zhuhai city, in Guangdong. 'When I entered into Guangdong I was immediately detained by the national security department on the crime of committing incitement to subvert state power,' he recalls. 'They put a black cloth over my face and put me in a car.' Friends believed at the time of his disappearance that he had been targeted for hosting WeChat discussions about Taiwanese democracy. He says he was also helping Chinese political prisoners and their families during a time that reminded him of Taiwan's White Terror decades of martial law. 'Authorities would isolate the families and the political prisoners - it is a necessity of a dictator to isolate them so they feel lonely,' he says. 'I was transferring the knowledge of how Taiwan can become more democratic, and gave the Chinese human rights workers a knowledge weapon to use with authorities.' From Guangdong, Lee was taken into residential surveillance at a designated location (RSDL), China's notorious form of secretive detention without charge or trial, used against tens of thousands of people. Lee describes it as 'an abduction'. Authorities confirmed his detention in late March and said he was in good health, but gave no other details until his formal arrest in May that year. He was charged with subverting state power and moved out of RSDL. E-Ling Chiu, the national director of Amnesty International Taiwan, said the process of arrest and detention used against Lee were against international human rights laws and standards. 'The crime is always misused for dissidents or human rights defenders in China,' she said. Lee Ching-yu, a researcher on Taiwan's period of martial law known as White Terror, became a vocal advocate for her husband's release. Her boss, Shih Ming-teh, a well-known Taiwanese activist who spent a total of 25 years in prison during and after White Terror, became a close adviser. 'He told me that when there is a difference in civilities, between dictatorship and democracy, legal means are quite useless so you must find other ways. So I was inspired to go and look for my husband,' she says. Her advocacy - including a dramatic thwarted attempt to board a flight to China and search for him in early April 2017 - attracted criticism, but she says her husband's conditions would improve every time there was international focus on his case. After his disappearance, Taiwan's government demanded answers. It accused China of obstructing the truth and damaging cross-strait relations, and the president, Tsai Ing-wen, said she was monitoring it personally. Over the coming months the case would go before the UN working group on human rights and the US Congress, and would attract the support of the EU parliament. Lifting an arm to adjust her glasses, the edge of tattoos that Ching-yu had inked before her husband's Henan trial in September 2017, reading 'Lee Ming-che, I am proud of you', peek from beneath a cuff. 'If not for the international media attention, the release would have been more difficult and his treatment would have been more severe,' she says. At the trial Lee confessed to spreading messages on Taiwan's democracy and supporting Chinese political prisoners and their families, two things he says are normal in any democratic country, 'but when it happens in China it becomes a claim of subversion of state power'. Beijing considers Taiwan a province of China and intends to one day retake it. Taiwan's DPP government says Taiwan is a sovereign nation. Beijing cut ties after Tsai's election in 2016, and Chinese authorities take an increasingly dim view of proponents of democracy, especially those from Taiwan. On 28 November 2017 he was sentenced to five years at Chishan labor prison. He and his supporters allege he was subjected to inhumane treatment, made to eat rotten food, forced into illegal amounts of labour, and frequently denied contact with family. He was denied a visit home for his father's funeral in 2019. Ching-yu could visit for just 30 minutes at a time, but after criticising prison conditions she was temporarily banned. Then came the Covid pandemic, further restricting visits. 'Shih said what a political prisoner fears the most is that they'll be forgotten in jail,' says Ching-yu. 'I would have 30 minutes every month to meet Ming-che, and my boss told me to use it wisely. Do not cry. Tell him how much the world and I have done for him ... There was a lot of worry inside of me that he would be changed into a man I could no longer recognise. But it was the man I fell in love with who returned.' The couple found out Lee was coming home at about the same time, just days before his flight. Lee feared he would be released from prison but forced to stay in China, until guards asked him for personal details to book a flight. For five years Lee had imagine seeing his wife at the airport as he stepped on to Taiwanese soil. Instead he was whisked through Taiwan's strict quarantine requirements and taxied to the centre, where he finally saw Ching-yu - through a pane of glass. Ching-yu smiles and cries as she recalls the night. 'We spoke on the phone for 16 hours. He shared a lot of his experiences from jail,' she says. Since Lee was first jailed, the rule of Xi Jinping over China has hardened. Relations between Taiwan and Beijing are their worst in decades. Activists and dissidents have been arrested, and millions of people have been subjected to religious and cultural oppression in Xinjiang. Lee notes there are four Taiwanese political prisoners in Chinese jails, and he calls for more global attention on Ilham Tohti, a Uyghur economist jailed since 2014 with no outside contact. Lee remains adamant of his innocence and unapologetic for his work, which he intends to continue. 'The work I have done was for human rights and for humanity, so I had no regrets for what I did,' he says. 'Because of my faith in it I have no doubt in what I did and I had confidence in my wife and her boss and my country Taiwan, and believed I was not abandoned.'", "feb951a15129b2594fe3abb69160c82a421da6f1a5f67551e753ca46": "Police in north-east Thailand have arrested a self-proclaimed holy man whose followers allegedly worshipped corpses and consumed bodily fluids as a cure for illness. There were chaotic scenes as officers raided the thatched house of Thawee Nanra, 75, deep in the jungle of Chaiyaphum province on Sunday. Supporters shouted and jostled with police as he was led, shirtless and white-bearded, to a police vehicle. Officers said they had found 11 corpses on the premises, which local media reported were believed to be bodies of his followers. The provincial governor, Kraisorn Kongchalad, said Thawee had at least a dozen followers living with him. Coffins containing bodies were scattered around the house. Devotees reportedly told authorities that the leader's urine and phlegm were believed to cure diseases. Kraisorn said he had been shocked to discover that such practices still went on in modern times. 'It's quite disturbing to see that there are people who believe in such superstition, but this is not only about a personal belief any more. We have dead bodies, and we will have to work with all agencies to establish facts surrounding these individuals,' he said. Thailand's population is overwhelming Buddhist, but many people hold beliefs outside the religion, some of which include the worship of local spirits and fear of ghosts. The authorities believe the group had existed for more than four years without anyone noticing because of the remote location of the leader's house. Their anonymity ended after a daughter of one of Thawee's followers complained to a social media celebrity who specialises in exposing unscrupulous religious figures. Thawee was initially charged with encroaching on a forest area - his house was said to be on public land - and holding illegal gatherings prohibited under disease control laws that have been used in the past two years to curb the spread of Covid-19. Local media reported that he had been denied bail on Monday. Police say they are looking into other charges, including the unlawful disposal of bodies.", "6a1b3ac6f1e9f08b0066d39439dee199a94a924a89bda0808ad92c5e": "A US firm known for betting against companies' share prices has said Elon Musk could submit a lower bid for Twitter, owing to a slump in tech stocks and a weak financial performance at the social media platform. Hindenburg Research said there was a 'significant chance' that the Tesla chief executive will seek to pay less than the agreed bid price of $54.20 (PS43.90) a share, which values Twitter at $44bn and has been accepted by the company's board. 'We are supportive of Musk's efforts to take Twitter private and see a significant chance the deal will close at a lower price,' said Hindenburg in a note published on Monday. It said the tech-dominated Nasdaq stock market had fallen sharply since the world's richest person revealed he had taken an initial stake in Twitter on 4 April, implying a lower share price for the social media plaform, whose value has been held up by the takeover situation. Hindenburg said that if Musk walked away, Twitter's shares could be caught up in the negative sentiment surrounding the Nasdaq and fall by 50%. Hindenburg added that Twitter's recent quarterly results had been poor and had not been priced into the stock, while Musk could pay a $1bn breakup fee to walk away from the deal. The investment research firm also dismissed speculation that Twitter could enforce a clause in the takeover agreement that required the multibillionaire to complete the deal. 'Musk has incredible leverage to renegotiate should he choose to,' said Hindenburg, which said it had taken a short position on Twitter. A short position is where an entity borrows shares in a company in the expectation that the price will fall. The entity sells those shares and then expects to buy them back at a lower price before returning them to the lender - pocketing the profit. Shares in Twitter fell 2.6% at $48.50 in afternoon trading in New York. Hindenburg said the deal as structured would leave Twitter with a high amount of debt and would make it difficult for Musk to achieve his goal of reducing the company's reliance on advertising. Adverts account for 90% of Twitter's $5bn in annual revenue. The deal is being part-funded through $27.25bn of cash, $7.1bn of which is coming from a group of investors and the rest from Musk. A further $6.25bn is in loans secured against Musk's shares in Tesla, with $13bn provided in debt financing. The bank debt will cost Twitter about $800m-$900m a year in interest payments. Hindenburg rose to prominence last year by taking an aggressive stance against special purpose acquisition companies, or Spacs, which are blank cheque vehicles that raise money from investors first and seek businesses to buy afterwards.", "e1494823ed0056dd9965a7061113a7c5b6a76d910a380afdc6e945b7": "Sixty-two years after the end of British rule, Cyprus has taken another step out of the shadow of its colonial past with a deal that ushers in the biggest change in land use on the island since independence. Describing the accord as groundbreaking, the president of the Republic of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, said it would enable thousands of Cypriots to develop properties in the 'sovereign base areas' that Britain has long held on to in the Mediterranean country. That, he said, would not only yield 'multiple benefits', but correct 'distortions and imbalances' in the lives of residents living in villages incorporated in the facilities. 'This is a truly historic agreement,' the leader told officials gathered in Nicosia's presidential palace on Monday. '[It] is expected to not only have important development prospects for those who reside, or who have properties, on the bases, but for the economy and society more generally at an especially difficult time following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.' The sovereign base areas - which include military bases, but also farms and residential land - account for 3% of the island's total landmass, or 98 sq miles. Although the accord was reached in 2014 under Britain's then prime minister, David Cameron, it required years of complex negotiations underscored by the peculiar nature of territory that, while home to about 12,000 Cypriots, remained in the possession of the country's former colonial power. On 16 May, when the deal comes into effect, owners will be able to submit planning applications to develop properties much as they can elsewhere on the island. Until now, non-military development of base areas, with the exception of agricultural land, has been tightly controlled, eliciting disquiet among local people, who have complained of being penalised in a country already divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion. Calling the accord 'a memorable moment' in ties between the two nations, Britain's high commissioner to Cyprus, Stephen Lillie, predicted that it would contribute greatly to the quality of life for those living on the military bases. 'Our agreement means that, as far as possible, residents in the bases will now enjoy the same rights as Cypriots living in the republic to sell and develop their land and property and all the benefits that brings,' Lillie said. 'I take pride in the fact that we have worked together to deliver a change that will have a real and positive impact on people's lives.' Restrictions have meant that much of the territory has remained unspoiled in contrast to otherwise heavily developed coastline in the rest of the island's south. As of next week, planning zones and policies in force elsewhere will come into effect, but the commander of British Forces Cyprus, Maj Gen Rob Thomson, insisted that development would also be subject to environmental and security controls. The installations are viewed as huge strategic assets by the UK, with RAF Akrotiri used as a forward mounting base for multiple operations across the region. Post-Brexit and in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the facilities' strategic advantage has intensified. In a first visit to the island by a chief of general staff in almost a decade, Gen Sir Mark Carleton-Smith highlighted Cyprus' significance to the British military. 'The UK is fortunate to enjoy a close bilateral partnership with the Republic of Cyprus and we retain sovereign bases here and have for many decades,' he said. 'They offer a military platform for us to base troops in the eastern Mediterranean but also to use it as a springboard to shorten our response times across the region. It's a region with a degree of strategic volatility and it's to our military advantage to acclimatise, train and prepare troops here in Cyprus.'", "4fc3f23d325c3601b68108d6457f6668edf434d88c495e988062df56": "There is still a long way to go before South Africa and other developing countries can manufacture Covid vaccines and treatments quickly and without paying the huge charges demanded by the big US and European drug companies. Last week, the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that the 180-member trade forum had taken a step towards a patent waiver that would allow developing countries to make the drugs they need - including vaccines, tests, and treatments - for as long as five years, without payments to pharma giants such as Pfizer.  The EU, India, South Africa and the US, known as the Quad, claimed to have come to an agreement on the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (Trips) waiver proposal, with China also expected to vote in favour.  Except the deal only provided for a continuation of Quad negotiations, and on the table at the moment is no more than what was on the table last year. Max Lawson, co-chair of pressure group People's Vaccine Alliance, said: 'It is a tragedy that it has taken almost two years and millions of deaths to reach this point, and a travesty that the action proposed falls well short of what is needed.' Health and anti-poverty campaigners say WTO boss Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, elected last year amid a fanfare of hope and expectation, appears to have provided cover for big pharma rather than pushing for wider access, as she promised. Ngozi's supporters say she is playing a long game, though Covid-19 may be a distant memory - and Pfizer shareholders even richer than they are today - by the time this long game plays out. She is understood to be in favour of a full waiver, but progress towards a breakthrough remains elusive, despite official claims to the contrary. Lawson said the WTO continues to place corporate interests over the needs of global health. 'It adds more unnecessary barriers than existed before negotiations began, and failure to act now on treatments and tests is inexcusable.' EU nations, distracted as they are by the war in Ukraine, want their own big pharma to rival firms in the US.  Which is why, Lawson added, 'this is not the Trips waiver supported by over 100 governments. It is not endorsed by any member other than the EU. And it is utterly insufficient for a pandemic that has killed an estimated 20 million people and rising'. Other experts have been demanding comprehensive change for months. In a letter to South African president Cyril Ramaphosa in March, Peter Kamalingin, Oxfam's pan-Africa director, Jayati Ghosh, professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, and Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, accused the WTO of failing to deliver 'any meaningful access to vaccines, treatments, or tests'.  They said the EU had launched a 'belligerent blockade of any actual waiver of intellectual property (IP) barriers' and criticised the US for its 'insistence that the IP waiver it supports be limited to vaccines'. The EU and US have also required countries to seek authorisation on a product-by-product basis, 'meaning no simplified pathway for follow-on manufacturers to produce and enter the market', they wrote. The three experts, who support South Africa's campaign for a full-waiver of all IP and patents on Covid medicines, said the WTO proposals needed to cover lifesaving treatments and diagnostics for Covid-19 because they are a vital part of an arsenal to prevent, treat and contain the virus. The problems faced by Ramaphosa in seeking to move the sluggish decision-making apparatus at the WTO are compounded by the complexity of vaccine manufacture, which relies on more than just access to patent information. He knows that taking off the table the secrets behind treatments for Covid-19 severely limits the ability of poorer countries' health systems from tackling further outbreaks of the disease. The People's Vaccine Alliance adds that another demand of the EU, that countries wanting to manufacture Covid-19 vaccines must 'notify the WTO's Trips council before exercising any of these rights', was 'akin to putting a target on your back for pressure from nations housing big pharmaceutical companies'. Why would the EU and US play hardball? Moderna and Pfizer, which uses the German firm Biontech's IP, will have new vaccines on the market by the autumn - known as 'bivalent' vaccines, that address Omicron as well as the other previous incarnations of Covid-19. German firm CureVac has partnered with Britain's GSK to make their own version. Lots of other pharma companies are in the hunt. This means that once again there will soon be new, better drugs for the rich countries, with developing nations at the back of the queue - and still paying top dollar for earlier vaccines less tailored to viral variants and mutations.", "2bae21eff9476ccd09057a57daaa20b00df79fe4d5df2789e8c7f5ac": "", "c1e088ad0edc57a4dd8b19e3fdee91029ba8d901e0564a6250b13525": "", "57b99c7fbe47a5085c17146d8e527652e5f154f6096c0ea9a5cc5644": "", "ec571867d4981c3b70234ec571e6ed915c55446dd9dd0b7d80baed1c": "", "a2c185cb8c89b3ef6367289dc872631e7c368a3acda3d9bd0f229d83": "", "a710f82c0f7f19739ff0e2b1a4ba9477c58a396c5d5f788bc28ca7fc": "", "9b8395667a3b455de338a5997a11e3dd3cecfc7eedecf813753db61b": "", "cf8b09df8961bc85165751dc7890e00c4b2c83ec3d55e12e5bc1b9af": "", "4ab5833814642a752c35dc8edcf0c641e0fbffba93ad24d9be27dfe1": "", "dddf3d76322fb56713529ae35c6b5ea699ac64ea3c0302371b3e6e50": "Say what you like about Donald Trump's supporters, you cannot fault them for commitment. When the former president arrived for his latest rally in a deeply rural corner of western Pennsylvania, many had already been standing in solid rain for 10 hours. The field in which they were to greet their revered leader was a mud bath. By the time Trump finally arrived, 20 minutes late, the scene had taken on the qualities of the apocalypse - like the closing sequences of the Fyre festival. On this occasion, the seemingly boundless patience of Trump's devoted followers was being put to the test for an additional reason. He had come to the Westmoreland Fairgrounds outside Greensburg to sprinkle Trump stardust on his preferred choice for the US Senate seat vacated by retiring Republican senator Pat Toomey. Whether Pennsylvanian conservatives go along with the endorsement when the primary is held on 17 May will have big consequences, not merely on Trump's record of advancing his chosen people - and with it his grip on the Republican party. It will also have ramifications for the November election which, in tune with recent contests in the state, is almost certain to be nail-bitingly close and could be critical in determining whether the Republicans retake the Senate. The trouble is, many Trump supporters don't know what to make of Mehmet Oz, the celebrity TV surgeon better known as Dr Oz. 'We love Trump, but we'll be booing Oz,' said Pam, 46, a local educator who asked to give only her first name. She admitted one of the reasons she had turned up in the first place was to see how hostile her fellow Trump supporters would be towards the candidate. In the end, after all that sodden waiting, Pam was disappointed. Occasional booing could be heard earlier in the evening whenever Oz was mentioned, but when the man himself took to the stage, whether by design or accident, the music was cranked up so loud that it was impossible to tell jeering from cheering. By now the pattern is well established. Prominent individuals are so desperate for Trump's blessing that they suspend cognitive functioning and act as his slavish mouthpiece. The phenomenon was vividly illustrated after the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol last year. Republican leaders including Kevin McCarthy were at first critical of Trump's role but then began faithfully repeating his big lie that the election had been stolen from him. More recently, JD Vance, the venture capitalist author of Hillbilly Elegy, ditched his earlier criticisms of Trump in order to win the former president's endorsement in the race for a US Senate seat in Ohio. The humiliating gambit paid off last week, with Vance sealing the Republican primary having received a bounce from Trump's backing. Of all the many examples of this form, there has rarely been as dramatic a shedding of fact-based reasoning in exchange for Trump's universe of alternative facts than that displayed by Oz. He has descended from the scientific heights of a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon, down through his promotion of quack remedies on his daytime TV show, and into a full-Maga embrace of the Trump big lie. Oz, 61, has an impeccable medical background. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, he is the son of Turkish immigrants and followed his father into cardiothoracic surgery, with Ivy League training at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. At his peak, he was an innovator in minimally invasive heart surgery. At Columbia University, where he treated patients until 2018, he authored numerous peer-reviewed papers bearing impenetrable sentences like this one: 'In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, CPB time, previous cardiac surgery, sternal wound infection, postoperative renal failure, and postoperative stroke were all associated with increased risk of mortality following MICS.' His weakness - or strength? - was the allure of fame and fortune. In 1996 he performed a heart transplant on the brother of the New York Yankees manager in the middle of a World Series which the Yankees won. Such extraordinary serendipity turned him into a media darling. Oprah Winfrey came calling, dubbing him 'America's doctor', and the end result was The Dr Oz Show which ran until this January. His show included public-service broadcasting, bringing attention to type 2 diabetes and encouraging his viewers to eat more healthily. But over time he slid into controversial territory. By 2014 he was being called a 'snake oil peddler' and hauled before a US Senate committee for touting 'miracle' diet products on The Dr Oz Show. 'I don't get why you need to say this stuff because you know it's not true,' Claire McCaskill, then senator from Missouri, berated him. During the pandemic, he championed several of the same discredited pseudoscience treatments such as hydroxychloroquine pushed by Trump. To complete the decline, the cardiothoracic surgeon has now incorporated into his Pennsylvania Senate campaign the falsehood that the 2020 presidential election that Trump lost was riddled with fraud. 'I have discussed it with President Trump and we cannot move on,' he said at a recent televised debate for the Republican primary. 'We have to be serious about what happened in 2020.' There is no evidence that fraud on a significant scale occurred in the 2020 election, in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. The problem with being a daytime TV host is that you leave a very long paper trail. Oz's rivals for the Republican nomination have been bombarding Pennsylvania voters with attack ads portraying him as a 'Hollywood liberal' and a Rino - Republican In Name Only. Among the inconvenient truths that the adverts regurgitate is the time that Oz invited Michelle Obama onto his show, his reflections on systemic racism and how it leads to disparities in health outcomes, and his discussions on how to reduce deaths and injuries from guns. The attack ads have featured a 2019 interview in which he questioned Republican states that were introducing bills to ban abortion at six weeks known as heartbeat bills. 'But the heart's not beating,' Oz is shown accurately saying. And then there was the segment on his show that he called 'Transgender kids: too young to decide?' where he invited children experiencing gender dysphoria and their parents to talk about their journey. The downpour of negative political adverts carrying politically awkward clips from the Oz show has clearly had an impact on the race. Latest polls show the Republican primary race as too close to call, with the TV personality in a slim lead on 18% to the 16% of his main rival, the super-wealthy former hedge fund CEO David McCormick. By contrast, the Democratic field of candidates appears to be already settled with a clear frontrunner: Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor, John Fetterman.  He is a champion of labour unions, legalised marijuana and combating inequalities in income, health and housing. Certainly, doubts about Oz remained prevalent among the Trump devotees braving the Westmoreland rain on Friday night. 'I'm leary,' said Ken Rockhill, 52. 'I want to trust Trump's candidate, but I'm leary. He's going to have to prove himself.' Rockhill, an artist from Pittsburgh, said his doubts about Oz stemmed from the candidate's time as a TV personality. Which was odd, given that Trump himself carries the same lineage. 'Oz was caught up with that whole Hollywood thing with his show,' Rockhill said. 'He was big with the Obamas, hobnobbing with all the stars - that never ends well.' Sharon Nagle, 60, a bartender from a small coalmining town, said she was troubled by Oz's dual US-Turkish citizenship. That issue has also been seized upon by Oz's Republican rivals who have called his Turkish ties a national security risk, forcing him to promise to renounce his Turkish citizenship should he win the Senate seat. Nagle also objects to Oz's Muslim identity. 'I love Trump, but he's got this wrong. I will never vote for a Muslim - they plan to take over America from within and pass sharia-style laws. That's what I think, and I'm not a bigot.' Pam, the Trump supporter who had come to see whether Oz would be booed off stage, said that as a Christian her antipathy to him stemmed from a 2010 episode of The Dr Oz Show that featured an eight-year-old girl who had transitioned from her male gender at birth. 'To use your platform to say a boy aged eight can change gender - that's evil,' she said. Did she think Trump had made a mistake in endorsing him? Yes, Pam said, showing a surprising willingness to question the former president's judgment despite being a fervent Maga supporter. 'The man is not God,' Pam said, referring to Trump. 'He puts his pants on, one leg at a time.' Out of curiosity, the Guardian asked Pam whether she ever watched The Dr Oz Show. Her eyes lit up and she beamed. 'Oh yes,' she said. 'We love the Dr Oz show!' Political strategists at the rally worked extra hard to try and overcome the chilly response to the Oz endorsement. Vance was rolled out on stage, with the clear hope that the victory he pulled out of the hat last week might somehow rub off on Oz. The crowd was assailed through the evening with 30-second videos attempting to debunk the portrayal of the candidate given in the attack ads. Here was Oz surrounded by children insisting life begins at conception. Here was Oz dressed in lumberjack shirt brandishing a double-barreled shotgun - how could this man be against the second amendment? When Oz finally addressed the crowd he reassured them that he was one of them - a genuine Maga man. 'The president endorsed me as an America First candidate ... President Trump endorsed me because I am smart, I am tough and I will never let you down.' Then Trump himself bigged up his chosen candidate. 'We endorse a lot of people a little out of the box,' he said, paying the subtlest lip service to his followers' misgivings. He reminded the crowd how Oz had invited him onto his show in 2016, giving the then presidential hopeful a great bill of health though telling him to lose a few pounds. 'Dr Oz has had an enormously successful career on TV and now he's running to save our country from the radical lunatics,' Trump said. Being Trump, his most passionate argument for voting for Oz was also the most quizzical. 'His show is great. He's on that screen, he's in the bedrooms of all those women telling them good and bad.' It's not quite clear what Trump meant by that. Will it be the Trump magic needed to put Oz over the finish line? We'll know in eight days' time. ", "52c1a55c238621f36fd49e063ff977b9311530e8007040d1cf44e731": "In this Zoom call, four men are looking at a list of family duties and marking which they do themselves and which they have been leaving to their partners. Earning money. School run. Laundry. Ironing. Cooking. Cleaning the bathroom. Buying school uniform. Putting children to bed ... Next, they discuss why that may be. 'It's just how we operate,' says one, a man who is no longer living with his partner, but spending a lot of time with her and their new baby. 'She loves cooking. I don't iron. She does iron ...' He runs out of steam. 'The way I look at it, I've been married 20 years and you evolve into what you do,' says another. 'That's how you decide what your jobs are. I do cook a meal occasionally but 95% of the time, she does the cooking and plans the shopping because she knows what she needs to feed the family. I earn the money to pay for it.' The third man is currently single. 'I used to take things for granted when I was in a relationship,' he says. 'Dinner being on the table, having clean clothes, having ironed clothes. I never really thought about it when I came in the door. I'm not sure that was being abusive; it's just the way things worked. Well ... until we split up. Maybe that's why.' This quiet contemplation of the domestic workload shows how far these men have come. This is the 12th module of the Lifeline behaviour-change course run by My CWA, a Cheshire-based charity that supports families affected by domestic abuse. All four of these men have been abusive to partners. Their attendance here is voluntary; two were referred by social workers, the other two referred themselves. One even moved to the area, living with his brother, just to qualify for the support (before the pandemic it was face-to-face group meetings; now it is delivered through Zoom). Only about half the men who start Lifeline stick with it to the end. There is no compulsion, it's a long and demanding course, and it requires perpetrators to take full responsibility for their actions with all the emotional consequences this may bring. These four, however, have already come a long way. They have completed level 1, which takes about 10 weeks. They discussed what brought each of them there and unpacked the worst incidents of abuse, along with their feelings and thoughts at the time. It taught them some safety strategies and emergency techniques to help them de-escalate and step back when tensions rise. Now they are more than halfway through level 2, which takes 22 to 24 weeks. Today they are covering the role of gender in abusive relationships. Next week, it's 'healthy sexual relationships'. Many of them found last week's session particularly tough. It was on the impact on children, and began with the men listening to a recording of a terrified child calling 999 as her mum is being beaten up at home. Then Colette Foster, the course leader, laid out the effects for children of witnessing domestic abuse - the impact on their educational attainment and life chances, and their increased risk of suicide, cancer, heart disease and substance abuse. She set out how it affects offspring of all ages, from babies to adults. She told the men what signs to look for and the men discussed their own children - and their own childhoods. Unsurprisingly, it became emotional: one man became so upset that Foster checked in with him the next day to ensure he was OK and would be coming back. Yet today he is here discussing housework, and how to show appreciation to a partner. ('This session hasn't been as head-doing as some of the others,' he is relieved to say at the end.) For decades, perpetrator programmes like this have been low profile and low priority. Spending scarce resources on abusers has been viewed with deep suspicion across much of the women's sector, where the focus and the funding have, unsurprisingly, been on the survivors. In 2019/20, 64% of refuge referrals were turned away and the number of refuge bed spaces in England was 30% below the level recommended by the Council of Europe. Only just over a third of services were able to provide formal counselling to women in their refuges. Just over a quarter were running without a dedicated resettlement service. 'Finding a refuge space is like finding gold dust,' is how Sandra Horley, former CEO of Refuge, put it in 2016. 'How can we justify spending money on therapy for perpetrators when terrified and brutalised women and children have nowhere to go?' Now, however, something is shifting. Respect, the UK's lead organisation on perpetrator programmes, has firmly positioned itself as part of the movement tackling violence against women and girls. Some of its programmes are delivered in partnership with groups such as Women's Aid, or the domestic violence charity SafeLives. And a six-year evaluation of 11 Respect-accredited UK perpetrator programmes by Durham and London Metropolitan universities found significant improvement over a range of behaviours. Interviewing partners, ex-partners, children and perpetrators, researchers found that reports of women being physically injured dropped from 61% before the programme to 2% afterwards. Cases of children seeing or hearing violence dropped from 80% to 8%. The results have been compelling enough for the Home Office to get behind them: in March, its Tackling Domestic Abuse Plan pledged PS75m for perpetrator programmes - far more than it ever had before. Saskia Lightburn-Ritchie, the CEO of My CWA, understands why it has taken so long to get here. When she introduced Lifeline more than a decade ago, she wasn't convinced it was the right way to spend resources. At the time, My CWA provided support, including refuges, to survivors of domestic abuse, but many survivors said that even when they had successfully separated from their abuser, the abuse continued, especially if co-parenting was involved. 'They were saying that no one at all was talking to the men about their behaviour, and it might help if someone would,' says Lightburn-Ritchie. 'It seemed a reasonable and sensible request - but it opened a can of worms.' When My CWA launched the Lifeline pilot, there was vehement opposition from the north-west women's sector. Women's Aid tried to cancel its membership. 'On a personal level, I'd been a victim of domestic abuse myself. I'd lived in a refuge,' says Lightburn-Ritchie. 'Then I'd spent 20 years working in women-only services. I wasn't sure that I could treat the men on the programme with respect. I thought I'd struggle with my own feelings about what they'd done. And I wasn't even confident that change was possible.' Yet she also believed it made sense to try. 'We focus all our efforts on victims and children, which is right,' she says. 'But, by not engaging with perpetrators and trying to hold them to account in a way that they can make a change, all we are doing is condemning any new person in a relationship with them to the same behaviours, the same abuse. It's just recreated in another family. It's like tackling a huge problem by only looking at symptoms not the cause, and it makes you tired. Well, it makes me tired. I want that cycle to break.' Lightburn-Ritchie has very clear memories of delivering the first programme. 'I was very surprised at my own reaction,' she says. 'I was able to see them as whole individuals whose behaviours were wrong but who had other positive features. There was one man who was really getting it, having lightbulb moments, so engaged. Then his child became very unwell, he wasn't coping and he assaulted his partner. I was devastated. But, for the first time ever, he didn't breach bail, he didn't pressure her to withdraw the charges; he pleaded guilty straight away.' That was a breakthrough. Lifeline is accredited by Respect - and the accreditation system couldn't be more critical. Respect was formed 21 years ago when a handful of perpetrator programmes joined together, partly to raise the profile of their work, but also to articulate good practice at a time when they worried about perpetrators setting up self-help groups, or short interventions such as weekend courses, and simplistic 'anger management' programmes. (Most perpetrators are already 'managing their anger' very precisely. They manage not to explode at their boss or the big man at the gym, but still terrorise and control their partners.) Ciara Bergman, Respect's head of perpetrator services, cautions that programmes that don't adhere to certain principles could make things worse. 'When you're delivering perpetrator work, the primary client is not the person in front of you,' she says. 'It has to be focused on the adult and child survivors of that abuse. We don't think any work should take place with perpetrators in the absence of parallel but separate support for survivors.' Because of this, a Respect-accredited programme will only take on a perpetrator if their partner (or ex-partner if there are children and contact) agrees to be involved. A separate 'partner-support worker' will then keep them informed and supported throughout. 'One of the most persuasive factors for a woman remaining with an abusive partner is the hope that they will get better,' says Bergman. 'If a perpetrator says: 'I'm going off on a programme to fix my behaviour', she might choose to stay in a risky situation. Then if he stops attending, she might not know.' (On one Respect training session, I see a letter sent to a partner purporting to be from the programme facilitators, although it was actually written by the perpetrator himself: 'We want to let you know that Mr X is fully engaged with the programme and has shown willingness and real commitment to making the necessary changes ...') 'A lot of perpetrators are very manipulative,' says Bergman. 'They may come home and say: 'I've spoken to the facilitators, and they say it's your fault. They say you need to do XYZ.'' The Lifeline course leaders are also trained to recognise deception or 'disguise compliance', where a perpetrator may say all the right things, but mean none of them. However, Lightburn-Ritchie is convinced the courses can have real impact. 'There are a few key sessions that astound me every time they are delivered,' she says. 'One is impact on children. Often the men have an innate belief that, although their behaviours are harmful, they are still 'good dads'. They manage to live with that dichotomy. When they start listening and making a connection with what they've done and their own children's experience, I've seen men who have served prison sentences break down and cry.' Another powerful session is around healthy sexual relationships. 'I remember interviewing someone after he'd completed the course to see how he got on, four years later,' she says. 'We'd never met before. He told me the hardest part had been to acknowledge that he'd sexually assaulted his wife - and that, actually, it was rape. Then he said he had to admit to himself that he'd always known, but just not listened to himself. It devastated him, but he said: 'I had to be broken to be fixed.' 'He wrote his ex-wife a huge letter of apology, taking responsibility. She didn't get in touch and he had accepted that he couldn't make her and didn't expect anything of her. He was in a new relationship that was running smoothly. There was a huge amount of growth. I was gobsmacked.' John, 28, has been through a Respect-accredited programme and agrees to speak to me. Although he is quiet and cautious, his words are compelling. He found the programme - Route2 in Middlesbrough - through an internet search and referred himself. It is one-on-one, with similar content to Lifeline. (He had previously attended a group programme but walked out. 'I just got sick of listening to people beating about the bush, saying it was their partner's fault,' he says.) He says he has only had one serious relationship in his life, which lasted two years. 'It was abusive for a while,' he says. 'It ended badly in 2019. It got to the point where I was arrested. I don't want to tell you what I did. I'm not over it. I'm still learning from it.' He began Route2 in early 2020, initially on Zoom, then in person when lockdown eased. 'What helped most was going deep into why my behaviour was the way it was,' he says. 'For me, I always thought that I was a bad person. Nina, my case manager, helped me think about my own family, the way I grew up and the part all that played. I'm not using my childhood as an excuse, but it helped me understand. Nina was more on the side of what I need to change, instead of judging me. She put different thoughts in my head.' Almost two years on, he still calls Nina every week, just to check in, and he is still single. 'I'm not ready for any relationship; I'm focused on being better myself,' he says. For John, the programme feels worthwhile. 'I'll be brutally honest. You can't help someone who doesn't think they're in the wrong. If you accept what you've done, if you really want help and you've stopped blaming everyone else, then anyone can change.'

She was in such severe constant pain, and unable to sleep for more than two continuous hours a night, that she was retired on ill health from her job at National Grid 'at the grand old age of 33'. She says: 'I had to stop work because the pain was too much. It's been very depressing; I really enjoyed my job. I tried so many different therapies and managed to get my arthritis under control but for fibromyalgia, there isn't anything, no magical pill.' She was taking up to 40 tablets a day, including 14 prescriptions such as opiate painkillers, as well as sleeping pills and laxatives to relieve the constipation caused by the painkillers. Wright would never consider smoking cannabis recreationally but started inhaling medicinal cannabis as part of a study run by the private London pain clinic LVL Health in January. 'To begin with I was completely knocked out but you do get used to it. Straight away my sleep was a million times better. I probably hadn't had a proper night's sleep since 2012. I stopped taking any sleeping pills. My pain levels have completely dropped as well.' Her next step is to start weaning herself off the opiate painkillers. She will always have to take some medication but is now working as an operations manager for Flowaime, a Cadent (previously National Grid) contractor. 'I'm able to work longer hours and go into the office. I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing now if it wasn't for medical cannabis. It's been life-changing.'", "36f2e53b525a1d67e435af04169c7e0f96bb98f9c295c57159460120": "Tuesday's Queen's speech is meant to be a relaunch for Boris Johnson's beleaguered government, against the backdrop of a deep cost of living crisis, and with Tory backbenchers still divided about his future. But if the advance briefing is anything to go by, this is an administration with little fresh to offer. A 'bonfire of red tape' is certainly not revolutionary: Gordon Brown had the Hampton review and the Better Regulation taskforce; George Osborne had his own 'bonfire of red tape', not to mention a 'Red Tape Challenge'. With the benefit of hindsight, most such efforts are widely viewed as worthy, but incremental. Of course, freed from the shackles of the EU, the government has more wriggle room to make regulatory change; but the examples given by Boris Johnson during the leave campaign - the size of olive oil bottles and the packaging for fish - underline the modest scale of what is likely to be possible. Such tweaks would also almost certainly be dwarfed by post-Brexit border bureaucracy. Some bills will enact crucial but long-promised changes, such as reform of the school funding formula, or ensuring Companies House, the official register of companies, combats fraud. Other plans, such as the levelling up bill, giving local authorities the power to force landlords to rent out empty shops and take control of empty buildings, appear modest, but are clearly designed to deliver the changes 'red wall' voters may hope to see if they are to stick with Johnson at the next general election. A new British bill of rights, meanwhile, allows the government to keep one of its favourite culture wars, the battle against 'lefty lawyers', burning brightly, while Channel 4 privatisation would cheer the party's rightwingers. But the overall sense, as with mooted plans for tackling the cost of living crisis that included two-yearly MOTs, is of a government scrabbling around for ideas. Part of the difficulty, for an administration which has never had much of a guiding purpose beyond Brexit and keeping Johnson in power, is knowing what its electoral constituency is. In Friday's local election results, the Tories received a kicking from the Lib Dems in the south, amplifying the warning signal sent by the Chesham and Amersham byelection last year. So the list of expected bills appears shot through with the contradictions of trying to keep north and south, red wall and blue wall, onside. Hence the toned-down planning reform mooted by Michael Gove at the weekend: gone is the no-holds-barred approach drawn up by his predecessor, Robert Jenrick, that was intended to disfranchise Nimbies and lead to a drastic increase in housebuilding. Instead, local authorities will apparently be given more latitude in applying housing targets; and Gove was full of soothing talk of small-c conservative developments such as Prince Charles's favourite, Poundbury in Dorset. While Conservative campaign headquarters sources continue to deny that an autumn election is even a remote possibility, there is also a whiff of Lynton Crosby's notorious advice to David Cameron to 'get the barnacles off the boat', too. Gone is the ban on foie gras and fur, it appears - and gone, too, the employment bill that would have strengthened workers' rights, but perhaps couldn't be easily shoehorned into the theme of levelling up. Plenty of legislative time will also be taken up working through bills carried over from the last parliamentary session - including on animal welfare and online safety. It remains to be seen whether Johnson can fashion a coherent narrative out of Tuesday's pomp and ceremony. But as after Rishi Sunak's spring statement, there is a clear risk that again, the main impression is of a government that has failed to grasp the scale of the crisis at hand.", "1fd617ddd67e67b5cfe41a03b294cb453ac4f4594f0c33980f3f547d": "Few places in Afghanistan are run by women. Public life and business are male-dominated and, since the Taliban's takeover, even more women have vanished from view. While some say they are stuck in conservative societal structures that rarely let them take control, others fear draconian new rules, the travel and education bans. But behind the walls of several female-run hospitals in Kabul, a different reality exists: here, women save lives on a daily basis, offer marriage advice, care for and adopt abandoned children. Many of the doctors and nurses working here have raised children and often remain their family's sole financial supporters. And they all agree: things work better when women run the show. 'We actually had a few men working here before the Taliban took over, but since this is mostly a maternity hospital, they kicked them out. Today it's women working for women,' Jagona Faizli, a gynaecologist, tells the Guardian. She is a mother of 'three beautiful daughters' whose husband is a stay-at-home father, covering her regular night shifts. 'He's the strongest man I've met, because he pushes against society's norms here,' she says. 'We married for love and I'd choose him again any day.' Faizli, 31, says her position at the hospital has given her the opportunity to talk openly and to get to know both her patients and staff well. 'There is no man to be seen, which is why I feel free in this hospital. Many of the women coming here tell me about their marriage difficulties. I try to give them advice and counsel them; I try to help where I can.' That is not all the women do. Mariam Maqsoodi, a 29-year-old resident doctor, says that after a rise in abandoned newborns at the hospital - probably due to Afghanistan's economic crisis - they have formed an 'adoption committee' to ensure the babies are taken care of. 'We register families who can't have children and would like to adopt, and if we can't find a family for the babies, one of our staff usually adopts,' she says, adding: 'It's sad. We recently had a little boy whose mother died while giving birth, and his father ran away without taking him home. We make sure each child is taken care of.' Up to 100 children a day are born at the hospital where Maqsoodi works - the doctors asked for the name of the clinic to be omitted for security reasons - and at least 140 female staff take care of all operations. 'I have four children myself and I miss them during the day, but I tell them I have an important job to do. When the Taliban took over, 12 of our hospital's doctors left the country. 'We were all afraid and most of us wanted to leave,' Maqsoodi adds, 'but we're still here saving lives.' It has been difficult. The women say they feel under pressure from the Taliban. After the Islamists' takeover in August, many of the medics stayed at home for weeks, too scared to go to work. Slowly, most of them returned to their jobs. 'We keep pressing on,' Faizli says. 'Even the Taliban know that they need us.' Places run by women are now even rarer in a country run by an all-male government, which has removed women from public office since August and continues to ban older girls from receiving an education. As the Taliban scramble to set up a functioning government, criticism of Afghanistan's new leaders is widespread. Human Rights Watch has accused them of imposing policies that have violated rights and created huge barriers for women. For months since the Taliban's takeover - and the subsequent freezing of the Afghan central bank's reserves abroad - doctors and other healthcare staff throughout the country have not received their salaries even though they have been working full-time. Recently, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) took over salary payments for thousands of health staff - men and women - across Afghanistan. Eloi Fillion, head of the ICRC's Afghanistan delegation, says: 'We've seen over the past months just how dedicated and courageous female health staff have been in showing up and doing their best to save lives every day, regardless of not receiving a salary, of having to travel long distances, working in health facilities that are struggling to function. 'Women are critical in ensuring the health system continues to function. Without them, the health system simply would not work.' Still, many women in healthcare say their futures feel uncertain. 'Most girls in Kabul still aren't attending secondary school, so what opportunities will my daughters have here?' says Faizli, adding: 'Afghanistan is no longer a place where I'm envisioning a future for my children. 'We're running the show at this hospital - and we could do this anywhere. We are leaders - including the future leaders of this country.'

They'll do it for a well-reviewed restaurant, promotional giveaways, or to take an Instagram photo at a popular tourist site. But at 3pm outside a Gongguan pharmacy in Taipei, there's grumbling in the line. It's an inconvenient time to leave work, but for now it's the only way to get your hands on a rapid Covid-19 test.  Twenty minutes after the sales window opens, a woman walks out to the waiting customers: they've sold out. People are frustrated, having waited for up to two hours, and some leave to try again tomorrow. Two elderly people lean over a phone, looking at a map for other pharmacies nearby. The pharmacist tells the Guardian that the store is only given 78 tests each day, and always sell out in less than half an hour. She laughs when asked if they can request more.  The disappointed customers rush to another pharmacy, where an employee with a megaphone says there are only tests left for the next four people. When one of those four says they aren't there to buy a test, the woman in fifth place jumps and shrieks with joy. An hour earlier, the central epidemic command centre (CECC) had reported more than 30,000 cases for the previous 24 hours - the first time Taiwan has seen such numbers in this pandemic. Once a poster child for the success of zero-Covid, Taiwan is now dealing with an 'Omicron tsunami'. In response - and in stark contrast to regional neighbours - health authorities have decided zero-Covid is no match for the new variant and have flipped the switch to 'living with the virus'. 'It is the right decision, and it's also the decision we had to make,' says Dr Chen Chien-jen, Taiwan's former vice-president and professor of epidemiology. Taiwan closed itself off in early 2020, and employed a regime of stringent contact tracing, social restrictions and personal hygiene measures which it kept even as vaccines and antivirals were developed. It defeated an outbreak of the Alpha strain and another of Delta in 2021. But after the highly virulent Omicron began affecting countries in November and December, Chen says he and other scholars advised the government to start shifting towards living with the virus. 'The CECC decided we should adopt the policy some time later when booster shots reached around 40-45% [several months away], but Omicron never waits for anyone,' he tells the Guardian. Instead, it began spreading through the community in March. Hong Kong, Taiwan and China were until now the last three major economies still clinging to zero-Covid. In Hong Kong the policy failed and the virus overwhelmed the city with disastrous results. In China, a steadfast commitment to it has produced arduous and economically damaging lockdowns, especially in Shanghai, with no end in sight. Taiwan appears to have seen both options, and decided on a third. It's called the 'new Taiwanese model': an acknowledgment that they can't stop the spread of Omicron, but that they can try - to use an early pandemic-era phrase - to flatten the curve. Cases are still rising and experts predict a peak is three weeks away, with as many as 3.5 million of Taiwan's 24.5 million people expected to eventually be infected, and up to 16,000 dead. As daily tallies ticked past 30,000 this week, the CECC continued to ease restrictions, drop mandatory QR code check-ins, and reduce quarantine times. It urged people to maintain mask-wearing, work from home if they could, reduce gatherings, get vaccinated and take a rapid test if they felt symptoms. It's also trusting people to self-report, and isolate or quarantine at home. So is it working? In many ways, yes. Chen notes the fatality rate of the outbreak is still extremely low, below 0.2%. This year 66 people have died with Covid-19, bringing Taiwan's total to 919 out of more than 345,000 cases. More than 99.75% of Omicron cases are mild or asymptomatic, and residents and businesses are still going about their days without lockdowns or panic. Visitor groups are being gradually allowed to return.  Hospitals are not at capacity, thanks to Taiwan pre-emptively ending a policy of mandatory hospitalisation for all cases. The same policy in Hong Kong had filled its hospitals before the wave began, but in Taiwan just 44% of hospital ICU beds (more than 62% in Taipei) were full as of Friday. Prof Yen Muh-yong, the director of the infectious disease department at Cheng Hsin hospital, says Taiwan's diversion of cases away from hospitals has been 'very successful in relieving pressure' so far. But he fears it still won't be enough for this wave and urges more integration of local and district services, to create surge capacity in the workforce and reduce hospital crowds. As cases rise there are also criticisms, including that the government is more reactive than proactive. Yen says transitioning to coexistence was the right decision, 'but the brain is giving directions the hands and feet are not coping with'. 'The government did not plan in advance for the procedures and the preparedness to live with the Omicron tsunami.' Rules and regulations change almost daily and incrementally. The death of a two-year-old boy last month highlighted communication failures exacerbated by Taiwan's entrenched bureaucracy. The child's parents had wanted to send their son to hospital but got conflicting instructions from multiple health services. By the time they got him to hospital it was too late. In factories, migrant workers have once again been discriminated against with unequal rule enforcement and eased restrictions, and poor vaccination rates among the very old and very young remain too low. Many elderly people have refused to get vaccinated against Covid-19, and the government only recently allowed vaccination for under-12s, despite lobbying from anxious parents. Across the capital city, hospitals are reporting crowds of patients who are not sick with Covid. A nurse and anaesthetist at a Taipei hospital tells the Guardian her colleagues are understaffed and overworked, and don't feel well supported. 'Everyone is nervous and they want to have PCR tests so they come to the emergency room, but there are also the patients who need to get more care than other people.' The nurse says there is not enough protective equipment or backup to replace staff who go on leave because they caught the virus, are a close contact, or need to care for family. Instead, they're told to keep working as long as they test negative, and are still subject to a pandemic ban on health workers leaving the country. Chen says authorities are addressing the issues in hospitals, but concedes Taiwan didn't prepare an adequate supply of rapid tests, and still don't have enough despite growing official reliance on them. On Monday, in response to mounting criticism, the government reverted to allowing some retail stores to sell non-rationed tests at market prices, but it didn't have access to brand details or supply levels. There is generally widespread support for Taiwan's efforts. Perhaps one of the biggest hurdles for the 'new Taiwanese model' was to flip the narrative from a fear-filled zero-Covid commitment to gradual coexistence. The lower severity of Omicron has helped, says Chen. Taiwan also came under more pressure to reopen after cautious neighbours like South Korea and Japan joined the US and Europe in opening. Recent polling by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation found an almost even split of 45% in favour of a coexistence policy compared to 46.3% who weren't. In July 2021 - at the tail end of the Alpha outbreak - 58.8% of people were worried the government was lifting restrictions too soon. Support for the CECC and minister Chen's handling of Covid has also increased in that time, from 66.4% of respondents to 77.7%. Yen says government messaging has been 'well disseminated and transparent'. 'People are not happy about the deficiencies in testing kit supply, and they are crowding in emergency departments but this can all be improved,' he says.

He has been seen greeting senior military officials ahead of a speech he is due to give shortly. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has issued a Victory Day statement, saying that Ukraine will prevail in the war. He posted to his official Telegram channel: Khreschatyk is the main street in Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Evgeny Popov, a member of parliament in Russia's state Duma, has been interviewed live from Moscow on Sky News. A staunch supporter of Russian president Vladimir Putin, Popov is a former journalist who has previously been banned from visiting Ukraine. He gave a robust defence of Russia's action in Ukraine, accusing Ukrainian authorities of using children as human shields, and of killing 14,000 people in Donbas over the last eight years. He said Russia had only had military infrastructure, Nazis and neo-Nazis as targets. He said Ukraine had shown no evidence that 600 people were killed in the bombing of a theatre in Mariupol. and he repeated Russian claims that pictures of wounded people in a maternity hospital used actors. On the issue of Finland's membership of Nato, he said they were welcome to do what they liked as a sovereign nation, but that it was a huge security threat if nuclear weapons were located in the Baltic, and that Finland should not 'bully' its neighbour. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us over the newswires of Russian Victory Day celebrations from across the country. Traumatised Ukrainian refugees who have sought sanctuary in the UK may have to wait two years before they can get specialised therapy to help them heal from the horrors of war, according to experts. Therapists who specialise in treating war trauma say they have seen NHS waiting lists of two years before refugees can access the specialist treatment they need. Services across the UK are patchy with some areas 'treatment deserts when it comes to trauma', according to Emily Palmer-White, a psychotherapist and community manager at the charity Room to Heal, which provides support for people who have fled persecution. 'There are often extremely long waiting lists. I have been told two years. You can't separate the psychological from the practical - it's more difficult to help people if they're preoccupied with survival,' said Palmer-White.

They report he said: Kherson region is to the north of Crimea, which Russia annexed after its 2014 invasion. As Vladimir Putin wages a bloody and unrelenting war in Ukraine, Guardian foreign correspondent Luke Harding has examined Putin's unlikely path to the Russian presidency.  From his humble beginnings in St Petersburg to his mysterious and 'mediocre' career in the KGB, in this video report we chronicle how Putin deftly manoeuvred himself to become one of the most powerful autocrats in modern history: Here's a bit of economic news from Reuters, which reports that Chinese exports to Russia are dropping rapidly, while Russian exports to China have jumped: The European Union should consider seizing frozen Russian foreign exchange reserves to help pay for the cost of rebuilding Ukraine after the war, its foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said in an interview with the Financial Times (paywalled). The EU and its western allies have put curbs on the Russian central bank's international reserves since the country began its invasion of Ukraine, actions Moscow describes as a 'special military operation'. Borrell told the newspaper it would be logical for the EU to do what the US did with Afghan central bank assets after the Taliban took over. Washington froze the Afghan funds after the military takeover by the Taliban and plans to use some to help the Afghan people while holding the rest to possibly satisfy terrorism-related lawsuits against the Islamist militants. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has revealed shortcomings in its ability to conduct precision strikes at scale, the UK's Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update: As Moscow prepares to host the main Victory Day celebrations - expected to begin at 10pm local time, or two hours' time - analysts have been speculating over what president Vladimir Putin will say regarding the war in Ukraine, and what meaning or impact it could have: In an analysis for the BBC, visiting professor of defence studies at King's College London Michael Clarke writes that the war is now one which 'Russia cannot win in any meaningful sense'. Here's a short excerpt: Victory Day parades have begun in Russia, the news agency AFP has tweeted, posting some images from the city of Vladivostok, on Russia's Pacific coast: Vladimir Putin and his inner political circle are 'mirroring the fascism' of the Nazis through the invasion of Ukraine, the UK defence secretary will say on Monday morning ahead of the Kremlin's annual military parade. Ben Wallace is also expected to accuse president Putin of hijacking the annual commemoration of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany - and to say the country's senior politicians and generals are complicit. 'Through their invasion of Ukraine, Putin, his inner circle and generals are now mirroring the fascism and tyranny of 70 years ago, repeating the errors of last century's totalitarian regimes,' Wallace will say in a speech at the National Army Museum in London. Soldiers and tanks not fighting in Ukraine will parade through Moscow and other Russian cities on Monday for the annual Victory Day parades, events that have taken on an increasing importance during Putin's 20 years in charge. But Wallace is expected to say that it is the presence of army generals that is particularly inappropriate, because they allow the Kremlin to make a false equivalence between the anti-fascist struggle of the second world war and the unprovoked attack on democratic Ukraine. 'Let's call out the absurdity of Russian generals - resplendent in their manicured parade uniforms and weighed down by their many medals - for being utterly complicit in Putin's hijacking of their forebears' proud history of defending against a ruthless invasion; of repelling fascism; of sacrificing themselves for a higher purpose,' the defence secretary is expected to say. Read on here: Residents of Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhya oblast have had their personal documents taken away by Russian authorities, the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces has said its latest update, saying they would be returned 'on the basis of the participation of the latter in the solemn events ... of Victory Day.' It also said 'the enemy' had 'carried out active preparations for the solemn parades' in Crimea, which was seized by Russia in 2014. Ukrainian intelligence has previously said that Russia is also planning to hold part of its key Victory Day parade in Mariupol, where around 2,000 members of Ukraine's Azov battalion, the last remaining Ukrainian fighters in the city, remain trapped inside the Azovstal steel plant. 'Mariupol, according to [Russia's] plans, should become the centre of 'celebrations',' Ukraine's defence intelligence agency said in a statement last week. 'For this purpose, the city is urgently cleaning the central streets from rubble, bodies of dead and unexploded Russian ammunition.' Russian president Vladimir Putin is set to preside over the country's Victory Day celebrations on Monday, when the country marks its victory over Nazi Germany in the second world war. The main event will be a parade in Moscow's Red Square of troops, tanks, rockets and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Putin is also expected to make a speech at midday that could offer clues to the future of the war. In an analysis for the Observer, Guardian correspondent Andrew Roth writes that that Putin may use the holiday to repackage the war in Ukraine:  Read on here: Hello, this is Helen Livingstone bringing you the Guardian's live coverage of the conflict in Ukraine. Here's a roundup of the latest developments:", "2b6cc38281ba40865c5af03a9d9f1fc07a650eb28ef18f60e69e90b8": "Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers they are 'fighting for the same thing their fathers and grandfathers did' as he used his Victory Day speech to justify his invasion of Ukraine. As Putin sought to rally his country through the memory of the second world war, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, pushed back in his own address from Kyiv. 'We will not allow anyone to annex this victory, we will not allow it to be appropriated,' he said. The dual speeches marked a closely watched anniversary in eastern Europe, where Russia has used claims that it is fighting fascism to justify its bombardment of cities such as Mariupol and Kyiv and to launch the largest military campaign in Ukraine since the 1940s.  Prior to the speech, foreign officials had said Putin could use it to launch a full mobilisation of Russian troops or formally declare war in Ukraine, but there were no large policy announcements. Instead he suggested Russia was 'forced' into the war by Nato and pledged to provide aid for the families of soldiers who had died in what the Kremlin is calling a 'special operation'. Speaking at the 77th annual celebration of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president launched a defence of his war in Ukraine, pivoting from a recognition of Russia's 'greatest generation' to a description of how it was believed Ukraine was being armed by the west for an imminent attack on Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. 'Nato countries did not want to listen to us,' Putin said. 'They had different plans, and we saw it. They were planning an invasion into our historic lands, including Crimea ... Russia gave a preemptive rebuff to aggression, it was a forced, timely and only right decision.' He also described the war as 'sacred'. 'The defence of the motherland, when its fate was being decided, has always been sacred,' Putin said, speaking of the second world war. 'And now, you are fighting for our people in the Donbas. For the security of our homeland - Russia.' Russia provided fewer armoured vehicles than in past years during the Red Square parade on Monday and a planned flyover was cancelled, ostensibly due to weather conditions. Putin did not bring up specific Russian victories in his speech, despite speculation his forces were engaged in a last-ditch effort to secure Mariupol and its Azovstal plant from the remaining Ukrainian defenders by 9 May. Instead, the Russian president addressed troop losses in the war, saying he had signed a new order that would give educational aid to the children of those killed. The Kremlin has been accused of seeking to cover up losses. After the sinking of the Moskva cruiser in the Black Sea, a number of families went public with claims the Russian military was trying to avoid confirming deaths onboard the ship. 'The death of each of our soldiers and officers is a grief for all of us and an irreparable loss for relatives and friends,' Putin said. 'The state, regions, enterprises, public organisations will do everything to take care of such families and help them. We will provide special support to the children of the dead and wounded comrades. The presidential decree on this was signed today.' The muted speech came in stark contrast to that delivered by Zelenskiy, who delivered a recorded address to a piano accompaniment as he walked through central Kyiv past anti-tank barricades. 'This is not a war of two armies,' he said. 'This is a war of two world views. A war waged by barbarians ... who believe that their missiles can destroy our philosophy.' In the speech, Zelenskiy took aim at Russian claims Ukraine had sought to block 9 May celebrations, a focus of Russian state media in advance of the holiday. 'Our enemy dreamed that we would refuse to celebrate 9 May and the victory over Nazism,' said Zelenskiy. 'So that the word 'denazification' will have a chance [to succeed] ... On the day of victory over Nazism we are fighting for a new victory. The road to it is difficult but we have no doubt that we will win. 'And very soon there will be two Victory Days in Ukraine. And some will not even have one left.'  On the ground, meanwhile, intense fighting raged in Ukraine's east, the vital Black Sea port of Odesa in the south came under bombardment again, and Russian forces sought to finish off the Ukrainian defenders making their last stand at a steel plant in Mariupol. More than 60 people were feared dead over the weekend after Russian bombardment flattened a Ukrainian school being used as a shelter in Bilohorivka, an eastern village, Ukrainian officials said.", "7c66273015b54584c465d5d5eeef99fb8e7cd2306e9210ad00fb8a8b": "", "5333b508d4a108f01763d988bf8f6ccbf2fd7130f3552878ab66a0d4": "", "815edf72a6bcf32a5c35434d85f8d48f469510b9b6c4565c9c347d0a": "Scores of inmates are feared dead in Ecuador after a deadly prison riot broke out between rival drugs gangs, in the latest bloody episode of a wave of violence that has engulfed the country's prisons. Forty-three prisoners were confirmed dead on Monday as more than 200 police commandos retook control of the maximum-security wing of the Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas prison, about two hours drive from the capital Quito, but the death-toll is likely to rise. Interior minister Patricio Carrillo told reporters that the majority of the victims had been 'executed with bladed weapons'. It is Ecuador's sixth deadly prison massacre since the beginning of 2021 pushing the death toll to nearly 400 as violence has spiked to unprecedented levels fuelled by rivalry between drug trafficking gangs. More than 300 inmates were slaughtered in the country's prisons last year, including one massacre in Guayaquil's Litoral penitentiary in which 119 prisoners lost their lives. Gruesome images on social media showed mutilated bodies strewn in a courtyard in the jail. Meanwhile, local television broadcast images which have become all too familiar to Ecuadorean viewers, showing dozens of relatives, mostly women, who had gathered outside the jail desperate for news of their loved ones. 'There was really a lot of cruelty,' Ecuador's police chief, Fausto Salinas, told journalists, adding that hand grenades, machine guns, revolvers and ammunition had been found at the jail. Earlier on Monday, he told local television that the immediate trigger for the violence was the transfer of a gang leader from another prison. 'The presence of this person generated conflict and violence,' he said, criticising the judicial authorities who ordered the transfer. This latest massacre is the first large-scale violent incident in the Santo Domingo prison this year. In February 2021, 33 inmates were killed in the same prison, many of them decapitated and dismembered, as part of a simultaneous attack coordinated by criminal gangs in different prisons that left a total of 78 dead throughout the country. Analysts say the spike in prison violence began when local criminal gangs began vying to work with the rival Mexican Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation drug cartels. Ecuador - which sits between Colombia and Peru, the world's two largest cocaine-producing countries - is a strategic smuggling route due to its long Pacific coastline and large shipping and fishing fleets. In the first four months of this year, Ecuadorean authorities have seized 85 tonnes of cocaine, twice the amount seized the year before. Ecuador's president Guillermo Lasso, who was on an official visit to Israel, expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and said: 'This is the unfortunate result of gang violence' in a tweet.", "0d56a3a7e64d6b022717d9617d29aff5166dcced269c28325515d385": "Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the Democratic Unionist party leader, has rebuffed appeals by the British and Irish governments and said he will block the formation of a new power-sharing administration in Northern Ireland. Donaldson told the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, on Monday that the DUP will not nominate ministers to the Stormont executive later this week unless Downing Street takes 'decisive action' on the Brexit protocol. Such a boycott would trigger a political crisis and paralyse devolved government in the region just a week after Sinn Fein triumphed in an assembly election, making its deputy leader, Michelle O'Neill, the putative first minister. The DUP came second, winning 25 seats to Sinn Fein's 27 in the 90-seat assembly. Under power-sharing rules, the executive cannot form unless the DUP nominates a deputy first minister and other ministers. After meeting Lewis, Donaldson repeated an election campaign promise to disrupt Stormont unless there were changes to the protocol. 'Until we get decisive action taken by the UK government on the protocol, we will not be nominating ministers to the executive,' he said. The DUP says the protocol, which puts trade checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, harms the economy and undermines the region's position within the UK. Only if those problems were resolved could it join an executive, said Donaldson. 'We want to see stable political institutions, we want to be part of the executive, we want to play our part.' Most unionists oppose the protocol but are divided on how to respond. Some favour working with London and Brussels to tweak the agreement. Others advocate obstruction and resistance, a radical strain that has pulled the DUP to a hardline position, leaving it isolated. Lewis, who flew into Belfast from London, delivered a coded rebuke when he urged all the main parties at Stormont to deliver a 'stable and accountable' devolved government. Ireland's taoiseach, Micheal Martin, said Northern Ireland's party leaders had a duty to heed voters who wanted a functional government to tackle crises in the cost of living and health services: 'All of us now have to have due regard to stability within the north, to the full workings of the institutions of the Good Friday agreement.' He told RTE there was a 'landing zone' for compromise on the protocol between London and Brussels. Downing Street has given mixed signals about possible unilateral action. All sides will monitor the Queen's speech at the state opening of parliament on Tuesday for further signals. The EU vice-president, Maros Sefcovic, urged pragmatism. 'We need the UK government to dial down the rhetoric, be honest about the deal they signed and agree to find solutions within its framework,' he said in a statement. O'Neill said the DUP should not try to 'punish the public' for its mistakes on Brexit. 'Brinkmanship will not be tolerated where the north of Ireland becomes collateral damage in a game of chicken with the European Commission. Make no mistake, we and our business community here will not be held to ransom.' Other party leaders echoed the calls for the swift formation of an executive. 'I want us to sit down, get the negotiations under way on the programme for government and the budget,' said Naomi Long, leader of Alliance, which won 17 seats, making it the third biggest party. 'We need the DUP to step up to the plate. You know, with power comes responsibility, and people now need to take the responsibility seriously.' Doug Beattie, leader of the Ulster Unionist's nine assembly members, said problems with the protocol would be resolved only through talks between London and Brussels. 'Northern Ireland has to have a say in that. We'll only have a say if we have a government.'", "a7e9fc46426ea2b299071c49961f30a234ea65493a8c87ec1d8658e2": "Emmanuel Macron has called for a new political organisation to unite democracies on the European continent, as he warned that Ukraine would probably not join the EU for several decades. Speaking two days after being sworn in for a second term as French president, Macron called for big thinking on the future of Europe, saying the war in Ukraine showed the need for a 'historic process of reflection'. He proposed 'a European political community ... a new European organisation [that] would enable democratic European nations who adhere to our values to find a new space for political cooperation', listing security, energy, transport, infrastructure investment and movement across borders, especially for young people, as issues that body would tackle. Being part of this organisation would not exclude a country from joining the EU, and the organisation could include 'those who have left' the bloc, he said. Macron's intervention comes as EU states clash on how quickly to move forward with Kyiv's membership application. The question is likely to reach a crunch point in June, when EU leaders decide whether to grant Ukraine candidate status, a procedural step that normally takes years to attain. Macron suggested he favoured a quick decision on candidate status, while dampening Kyiv's hopes of a speedy entry into the EU. The awarding of candidate status is followed by talks on accession and a process of reform so that a country meets the EU's political, economic and legal criteria. 'Even if we were to give it the status of candidate country tomorrow - I hope we move forward towards accession rapidly - even if we were to do that, we all know only too well the process for accession would take several years; in truth, it would probably take several decades. And that is the truth unless we decide to lower the standards for accession and rethink the unity of our Europe, and also partially the principles that we hold,' he said. 'The European Union, given its level of integration and ambition, cannot be the only way to structure the European continent in the short term.' Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, is championing a speedy processing of Ukraine's membership application, backed by central and eastern European states. Western European members, however, are wary about allowing Ukraine to proceed quickly, fearing Kyiv would not have time to complete vital political reforms, while the process would stoke tensions with six western Balkan countries that have been stuck in the EU membership queue for years. Von der Leyen said Ukraine had submitted a 5,000-page document to Brussels answering questions on its suitability to join the bloc, and in remarks aimed at Ukrainians at an event in the European parliament to celebrate Europe Day, she said: 'The future of Europe is also your future.' Macron also set out goals for the war, saying Europe had 'to do everything to ensure that Ukraine will survive, Russia will never win, preserve peace on the rest of the continent of Europe and avoid any escalation'. Only Ukraine could decide on negotiating conditions with Russia, he said. And he warned against a punitive settlement on Russia when the war is over. 'When peace returns to European soil, we will have to build new security balances and together we must never give into the temptation ... or the desire for revenge, because we know how much that has ravished the road to peace in the past.' The two leaders were speaking at a special session of the European parliament in Strasbourg, where they marked the end of an 11-month citizens' juries project, the Conference on the Future of Europe. At the closing ceremony, EU leaders, citizens and MEPs listened to the EU anthem and watched an interpretative dance routine performed in the aisles of the parliament's debating chamber. Both leaders contrasted the event with the Victory Day commemorations in Moscow. Referring to a woman who appeared with her baby at the Strasbourg ceremony, Von der Leyen said she wanted to celebrate this image on 9 May, 'an image far more powerful than any military parade going up and down the streets of Moscow'. Away from the soaring rhetoric, the citizens project has triggered a row about whether the EU should change its treaties in response to its conclusions - 49 proposals covering the climate emergency, health and young people, among other themes. Von der Leyen said treaty change could not be excluded, while Macron said he supported proposals to convene a convention to revise the treaties. But a group of 13 Nordic, central and eastern European countries hit back at people seeking to 'instrumentalise' the Conference on the Future of Europe, probably a reference to federalists in the European parliament.", "c40f490db434fd905b44212c6740711323e1604e3052f429b2aaec8e": "The Republican governor of Mississippi has refused to rule out attempting to ban some forms of contraception if the supreme court ruling that guarantees the right to abortion should fall. 'That is not what we're focused on at this time,' Tate Reeves said. The ruling, Roe v Wade, seems likely to be overturned this summer, after the leak of a draft supreme court decision supported by five conservatives on the nine-member court. The leak set off celebrations among conservatives and protests among liberals, as a near 50-year battle over a key privacy right approached a decisive moment. Like other states, Mississippi has a 'trigger law' which if Roe falls will outlaw almost all abortions, with exceptions in cases of rape or threat to the life of the mother. The case at issue in the draft ruling, Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organisation, originated in Mississippi. Speaking on CNN on Sunday, Reeves confirmed that his state's trigger law would go into effect if Roe is overturned. Reeves' host on CNN, Jake Tapper, then referred to neighbouring Louisiana, where Republicans have advanced a bill to make abortion a crime of murder. Tapper said: 'They're talking about not only criminally charging girls and women who get abortions as committing homicide, but they're also talking about defining the moment of conception as fertilisation, which would theoretically ... mean if you use an IUD [intrauterine device], you are committing murder. '... I'm not making this up. These are the conversations going on in legislatures in your area. So, just to be clear, you have no intention of seeking to ban IUDs or Plan B [morning-after pills]?' Reeves said: 'That is not what we're focused on at this time. 'We're focused on looking at - see[ing] what the court allows for. The bill that is before the court is a 15-week [abortion] ban. We believe that the overturning of Roe is the correct decision by the court. And so, in Mississippi, we don't have laws on the books that would lead to arresting individuals or anything along those lines.' Asked if that meant he would arrest doctors who performed abortions, Reeves said: 'I don't think that you're going to see doctors performing abortions if we have a state statute which says that they're not allowable, except for those exceptions that we have mentioned earlier.' Reeves also said: 'I believe that life begins at conception. 'And as I have said repeatedly - and I know where this question is ultimately going with respect to birth control and other measures - I want to be clear. My view is that the next phase of the pro-life movement is focusing on helping those moms that maybe have an unexpected and unwanted pregnancy. 'The next phase of the pro-life movement is making sure that those babies, once born, have a productive life. And while I'm sure there will be conversations around America regarding [contraception], it's not something that we have spent a lot of time focused on.' Democratic New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand told CNN she was 'pretty offended by [Reeves'] remarks. 'He doesn't look at women as full citizens,' Gillibrand said. 'He's taken away their right to make these fundamental decisions about when they're having children, under what circumstances they're having children, how many children they're having, at what point in their life they're having children. 'It's outrageous that this governor and governors and legislatures across America are going to take this draft opinion, when it is final, and deny women these fundamental life-and-death decisions about their future and about their families.'", "40c251f9d56ee9477e07c044430215f63dc37ffdb1f4438d84a304a1": "A Texas woman got a bang for her buck when her purchase of a $34.99 marble bust from a Goodwill thrift store turned out to be a relic from ancient Rome. Laura Young, who has been reselling antiques for 11 years, came across a 52lb marble bust in an Austin Goodwill in 2018. 'I was just looking for anything that looked interesting,' Young told CNN. She added: 'It was a bargain at $35 - there was no reason not to buy it.' After purchasing the bust, Young reached out to various auction houses and experts to find out more about the sculpture. A specialist used a digital database to track down the bust's provenance and found photos from the 1930s featuring the head in Aschaffenburg in Bavaria, Germany. Sotheby's eventually confirmed that the bust was estimated to be about 2,000 years old, and came from ancient Rome. Furthermore, the bust probably belonged to Roman military leader Sextus Pompey, according to San Antonio Museum of Art postdoctoral fellow Lynley McAlpine. Pompey's father was Pompey the Great, a political ally turned enemy of Julius Caesar. The bust was once kept at Pompejanum, a replica of a Pompeii-style Roman home that was commissioned by King Ludwig I and built in the 1840s. Pompejanum displayed the bust until the second world war, when groundskeepers placed the sculpture and other relics in storage as the villa came under attack. For about the next 80 years, the bust's whereabouts were unknown - until Young dug it up at a Goodwill. 'It seems like sometime between when it was put into storage until about 1950, someone found it and took it,' McAlpine told CNN. 'Since it ended up in the US it seems likely that some American that was stationed there [during the war] got their hands on it.' Young tried to track down the person who donated the bust through Craigslist but was unsuccessful. 'I would really love it if whoever donated it came forward,' she told CNN. 'It's most likely not the original person who took him, but [I] would still like to know the story.' The San Antonio art museum was loaned the bust for a year, but the piece still technically belongs to Germany because it was stolen from storage. Germany anticipates getting the bust back in May of next year and then displaying it once again in the Pompejanum.", "5651d5e0c3e7d2a40cdc4fc234d05f85b97bf8979ce8fd22738b5152": "Keir Starmer has pledged to resign as Labour leader if he is fined for breaching Covid rules by taking part in a gathering in Durham last year in which he and other party activists ate takeaway food and drank beer on a campaigning trip. His deputy, Angela Rayner, who also attended the event, said she would also resign if she was found to have broken the rules by Durham police, who last week started a new investigation into the event, which occurred on 30 April 2021. Starmer said he was determined to prove he had 'different principles to the prime minister', who has already been issued with a fixed-penalty notice for breaching lockdown rules in Downing Street. The Labour leader said he was determined to prove no rules were broken. 'The idea that I would casually break the rules is wrong. I don't think those who are accusing me of it believe it themselves ... They are trying to say all politicians are the same.' In a statement at Labour HQ, he said: 'If the police decide to issue me with a FPN, I would of course do the right thing and step down ... The British public deserve politicians who think the rules apply to them.' After hours of agonising with key aides, Starmer said he intended to draw a distinction with Boris Johnson's approach. 'I stand for honour and integrity, and the belief that politics is a force for good, and we shouldn't all be dragged down by this cynical belief that all politicians are the same. And I am here to make it clear that I am not the same,' he said. 'We are not all the same. I am different.' Starmer said it had been entirely his decision, amid reports he had come under pressure to make the declaration. 'This is my decision about what is the right thing to do in these circumstances,' he said. 'This is about me. It's about what I believe in in politics. It's about integrity, and I believe in integrity, and integrity requires me to take the course of action I have set out if, in the event, I get a fixed penalty notice.' . Starmer had called on both Johnson and Rishi Sunak to step down after the prime minister and chancellor were among those fined for being at a lockdown-breaching birthday celebration for Johnson in Downing Street in June 2020. Rayner put out her own statement on Monday afternoon confirming she would also resign if the rules were found to have been broken. 'I've always been clear that I was at the event in Durham working in my capacity as deputy leader and that no rules were broken. Eating during a long day's work was not against the rules,' she said. 'We have a prime minister who has been found to have broken the rules, lied about it and then been fined. If I were issued with a fine, I would do the decent thing and step down.' Earlier on Monday Starmer pulled out of a speech at the Institute for Government as he wrestled with how to respond to the renewed pressure on him over the conduct at the gathering in Durham of Labour aides, some of whom were reported to have been drunk. The pressure from the scandal has caused some despair among Labour MPs for preventing the party from capitalising on local election results and key airtime ahead of the Queen's speech on Tuesday. 'We've lost hugely valuable time to make our case for what we would be doing in government by cancelling this speech - all because Keir is yet again unable to be bold,' said one MP who counselled in favour of Starmer saying he would be prepared to resign. Mary Foy, the Labour MP for the City of Durham, in whose constituency office the lockdown meal took place, denied the reports on Monday that some staff had been drunk. 'These allegations about my staff are untrue,' she said in a statement. Starmer has a loophole where he could potentially be criticised by Durham police but not fined - an approach they took after an inquiry into alleged lockdown breaches by Dominic Cummings, who was then the prime minister's senior aide. Answering questions from the media, Starmer indicated that he would not necessarily step down if police did not fine him, but said the event could have breached rules. 'The penalty for a Covid breach is a fixed-penalty notice,' he said when asked about that situation. 'That's a matter of law. And I've set out what the position is in relation to that.'", "c627ed652204812b3f74eadd66fb879c43c0092a144f026e4c33bdd0": "", "3162069976d74fdc4d140c7f48175618c052a7037c353bd9bf346490": "", "c3f405bbec2bc4c5fa492394bb4c6a7dd3a092b63f3050378b1b64c9": "", "123f16de1405aad4f40466109f081206cf978babec9365071e1d692d": "", "177dde57c792044c4daf5ee94fd57faba1953795f43f757cfc8ebe26": "", "f16d982cce902121e45c574674ded3512df475e59a7ff149e80dc68d": "", "9917396a6217be81554d8c66e241eb6425084948a4f9bb718e896a62": "Sri Lanka's prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, has resigned after months of protests over the country's deepening economic crisis, as once-peaceful protests turned turned violent and at least five people were killed in clashes. Turmoil began to engulf the country on Monday following violence at a major protest site in Colombo, where pro-government supporters attacked demonstrators and police responded with teargas and water cannon. Anti-government protestors, who had been largely peaceful, began retaliating across the country. Houses and vehicles of several pro-Rajapaksa politicians and the residence of Mahinda Rajapaksa were set on fire. A nationwide curfew was imposed but five were killed and almost 200 injured. In one incident just outside of Colombo, a politician from the ruling party opened fire on anti-government protesters blocking his car, killing a 27-year-old, and then later took his own life. According to police, another ruling party politician opened fire on protesters in the southern town of Weeraketiya, killing two and wounding five. Mahinda Rajapaksa had been asked to resign by his brother, the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, at a special meeting on Friday, in an attempt to appease demonstrators who have been taking to the streets in their thousands since March. Protesters have been calling for both members of Sri Lanka's powerful Rajapaksa political dynasty to be removed from office for mishandling the economy and plunging the country into the worst financial crisis since independence. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was president for a decade between 2005 and 2015, had reportedly been resistant to stepping down, but on Monday submitted his letter of resignation to the president. 'Multiple stakeholders have indicated the best solution to the present crisis is the formation of an interim all-party government. Therefore, I have tendered my resignation so the next steps can be taken in accordance with the Constitution,' he wrote. The resignation is the latest concession made by the Rajapaksas in the face of protracted anger and protests. The president recently agreed to repeal an amendment to the constitution which had concentrated power in his hands and hand power back to the parliament. Other members of the Rajapaksa family who had previously held seats in the cabinet have also stepped down, with the president the only remaining member of the political family still in power. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, known widely as Gota, has repeatedly said he will not resign as president, despite the clarion call of the protests being 'Gota go home'. The resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa means the government will be dissolved. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who remains as the executive, is expected to invite members of all political parties to form a cross-party cabinet, described as a 'unity government', in an effort to implement some political stability amid the widespread anti-government unrest. The Rajapaksas have largely controlled Sri Lankan politics for two decades, but the economic crisis has rattled their grip on power in the face of mass unrest from those who had previously been supporters of their brand of chauvinist nationalist politics, which pandered to the country's Sinhalese Buddhist majority. Sri Lanka's foreign reserves have dropped so low that the country cannot afford to import basic essentials, leading to shortages of fuel, food and medicines. People have been forced to endure daily power cuts of up to 10 hours, fuelling mass protests across the country since March. Over the weekend, the president declared a state of emergency in the country, the second in recent weeks, in a bid to regain control over the streets. However, Monday marked a violent shift in the demonstrations when hundreds of pro-government supporters gathered outside the prime minister's residence in Colombo and urged Mahinda Rajapaksa not to resign. The group, some armed with sticks and wooden bars, then launched an attack on an anti-government protest camp nearby, with police reportedly looking on as the clashes began. Police deployed teargas and water cannon, and around 180 were taken to hospital with injuries. Army and paramilitary troops were deployed to the site and a curfew was declared in the area. The incident was a catalyst for violence which spread first through the city and then across the country, as the homes and cars of several lawmakers, including Mahinda Rajapaksa's residence in the city of Kurunegala were set on fire. Gotabaya Rajapaksa tweeted: 'Strongly condemn the violent acts taking place by those inciting & participating, irrespective of political allegiances. Violence won't solve the current problems.' However, many were quick to point out that the attacks had been prompted by Rajapaksa supporters. The US ambassador to Sri Lanka condemned 'the violence against peaceful protesters today, and [called] on the government to conduct a full investigation, including the arrest and prosecution of anyone who incited violence'. The economic situation in Sri Lanka remains dire, with the country virtually bankrupt. It has already defaulted on its billions in foreign loans and is in discussions with the International Monetary Fund for an emergency loan and financial assistance to get the country back on its feet.", "f6036416148e7fce4a47cb5c5aa17540273cb1e54863888c6548522d": "Latin America's largest city, Sao Paulo, is reportedly planning to open a campsite for rough sleepers in response to a Covid-fuelled homelessness crisis that has forced thousands on to the streets. The homeless population in Brazil's economic capital, which has about 12 million residents, grew by more than 30% during the coronavirus pandemic in what activists have called a humanitarian emergency. On Saturday morning one of Sao Paulo's 31,000-plus homeless residents stood outside the city's Museum of Sacred Art with a tatty sign that spoke to the scale of the social catastrophe. 'Estou comendo do lixo,' it read. 'I'm eating from the trash.' According to a report in one local newspaper on Monday, the city hall is now planning to create a campground where Sao Paulo's homeless can erect tents and be given access to bathroom and laundry facilities. 'The mayor has said that, given the acuteness of the city's circumstances, money would not be an obstacle,' the city's new human rights and citizenship secretary, Soninha Francine, told the Folha de Sao Paulo. Francine said it was an emergency that so many families were having to sleep rough because they could no longer afford to pay rent or for cooking gas. Official statistics reveal a dramatic situation in Brazil's biggest city: according to Sao Paulo's city hall, there were people living in tents and wooden shacks in nearly 6,800 different areas last year, compared with only about 2,000 two years earlier. Their inhabitants reportedly include a growing number of women, families and elderly citizens. Speaking in Sao Paulo on Saturday, Brazil's former left-wing president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva denounced the social calamity blighting the country he governed from 2003 to 2011, with inflation soaring and 12 million unemployed. 'Hunger has returned,' said Lula, as he announced his intention to challenge the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, in October's presidential election. Brazil's hunger crisis was exposed last year by heart-wrenching photographs of down-and-outs scavenging through a heap of animal carcasses in a middle-class Rio de Janeiro neighbourhood, just a few minutes' drive from its most famous beaches. 'A governor who is incapable of shedding a single tear when there are humans rummaging through rubbish trucks for food, isn't worthy of the title,' Lula said on Saturday, in reference to those shocking images. Brazil is not the only Latin American country grappling with the social fallout from a coronavirus pandemic that has plunged millions of citizens back into extreme poverty. The number of people living in extreme poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean rose from from 81 million to 86 million between 2020 and 2021, according to the United Nations.", "3431c750f150988d31ed23433c8c741e87361359277b856f5c8a4bba": "An experimental cancer therapy that infuses designer immune cells into patients has shown early promise in a clinical trial by shrinking tumours in the digestive system. Interim results from the first phase of the clinical trial found that the tumours in nearly half - 48.6% - of the 37 patients treated so far reduced in size after the therapy. While the findings come from an initial safety assessment of the approach, researchers running the trial in Beijing believe it demonstrates the potential for genetically altered immune cells to treat advanced gastrointestinal cancers. So-called Car T-cell therapy takes white blood cells, or T cells, from patients and modifies them so that they can recognise and kill cancer cells. The approach has met with dramatic success as a treatment for blood cancers such as leukaemia, but solid tumours have proved more difficult to target. Writing in Nature Medicine, researchers led by Dr Lin Shen at the Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute describe how they made Car T cells that target tumours bearing a protein called CLDN18.2. The protein is found in many cancers, but particularly in gastrointestinal tumours. The researchers infused Car T cells into 37 patients with advanced cancers of the stomach, digestive tract or pancreas and found that while all experienced side-effects, the therapy had an 'acceptable safety profile'. The treatment seemed most effective in those with stomach cancer, with more than 57% responding to the infusions. The scientists stress that the findings need to be verified in the complete trial, but say the interim results suggest the approach 'has the potential to become an important treatment modality for patients with advanced gastric cancer'. About 6,500 people are diagnosed with stomach cancer in the UK each year, roughly half of whom are over 75. Waseem Qasim, professor of cell and gene therapy at the Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street hospital, who works on Car T-cell therapies, said the preliminary results were promising. 'The report provides some strong hints that engineered Car T cells can help shrink gastric cancers, in this case by targeting a particular flag on the surface of cells. As for other advanced solid cancers, achieving complete remissions is challenging, but the experiences shows there is potential for interventions that redirect the immune system against cancer,' he said. Prof Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said: 'Car T-cell therapies, which harness modified versions of our own immune cells to fight cancer, have so far had limited success in solid tumours, which make up most cancers. So it's particularly promising to see these results, which show a high percentage of people with digestive cancers seeing the benefits of treatment last beyond six months. 'This is encouraging, as people with digestive cancers have very few treatment options. The study is still at an early stage, and larger-scale clinical trials will need to be done before Car T-cell therapies can be used routinely in this setting.'", "17752a5d63791b5842aa3d51f77634e5a9b85cf2c8b80e15c31695ec": "The last civilians rescued from the besieged Azovstal steel plant complex in Mariupol reached safety in Ukrainian held territory late on Sunday evening. The convoy arrived in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia after dark, carrying about 170 evacuees. There were 51 civilians who had been sheltering in the Azovstal complex, and about 120 others who had walked or hitched lifts across the city to a pickup point in a ruined shopping mall. The journey of just over 200 kilometres took two days, as the convoy of buses was held for hours at Russian checkpoints and the hungry, weary residents inside interrogated. 'I didn't think we would make it out alive, so I don't have any plans for my future,' said Natalia, who worked at the Azovstal plant all her adult life and then sheltered for over two months in its network of bunkers. She had fled with little more than a collection of drawings made by children in their shelter; she had organised drawing competitions to occupy them and kept the pictures to remember. 'I wouldn't have given them up even if they shot me.' Ukraine's Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Saturday that 'all women, children and elderly' had come out of the complex and were being evacuated. About 36 hours later the group filed slowly off the buses into the late evening dark, and fell upon a hot meal prepared in the registration tent. It also had clothes and toys, as most people fled with just a couple of bags. 'It is a breath of fresh air to be on Ukrainian-held land,' said Tatiana, who fled with her daughter and granddaughter. Many children and elderly people were among the exhausted-looking arrivals. 'I just want to live and start again ... everything I have is here,' said Yegor Chekhonadsky, pointing to a cluster of bags at his feet. He, his wife and two sons had sheltered at Azovstal since early March. 'Of course I'm overjoyed, and happy to be in Ukraine.' Mariupol has endured the most destructive fighting of the 10-week-old war. The plant is the last part of the city - a strategic southern port on the Azov Sea - still in the hands of Ukrainian fighters. Scores of civilians were trapped for weeks alongside them in the plant with little food, water or medicine. Pascal Hundt, the head of delegation for the ICRC in Ukraine said the group 'have all endured a level of horror no human should have to go through.' The operation began on 5 May, the third safe passage coordinated in recent days, but around 2000 soldiers - many of them injured - are thought to remain trapped. Earlier on Sunday, the remaining Ukrainian fighters at the plant vowed to continue their stand as long as they are alive. 'We don't have much time,' Captain Sviatoslav Palamar told an online news conference, pleading with the international community to help evacuate wounded soldiers.

The parade comes two days after Russian forces bombed a village school in eastern Ukraine killing about 60 people, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The governor of the Luhansk region said about 90 people were sheltering at the school in Bilohorivka on Saturday when it was bombed. 'As a result of a Russian strike on Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, about 60 people were killed, civilians, who simply hid at the school, sheltering from shelling,' Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. There was no response from Moscow to the news. Putin, Russia's leader since 1999, has in recent years used Victory Day to needle the West from a tribune in Red Square before a parade of troops, tanks, rockets and intercontinental ballistic missiles. This year, a fly-past over the nine domes of St Basil's Cathedral will include supersonic fighters, strategic bombers and, for the first time since 2010, the Il-80 'doomsday' command plane, which would carry Russia's top brass in the event of a nuclear war. Putin has repeatedly likened the war in Ukraine - which he wrongly casts as a battle against dangerous 'Nazi'-inspired nationalists in Ukraine - to the challenge the Soviet Union faced when Adolf Hitler invaded in 1941. 'Our common duty is to prevent the renaissance of nazism which has brought so much suffering to people of different countries,' Putin said in a message to the peoples of 12 former Soviet republics including Ukraine and Georgia. Ukraine and its allies reject the accusation of nazism in Ukraine and that Russia is fighting for survival against an aggressive West, saying the Kremlin leader unleashed an unprovoked war in an attempt to rebuild the Soviet Union. Putin, who has repeatedly expressed resentment over the way the West treated Russia after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, says Ukraine has been used by the United States to threaten Russia. US president Joe Biden has cast Putin's invasion of Ukraine as a fight in a much broader global battle between democracy and autocracy and has repeatedly called Putin a war criminal. In a speech in Warsaw in March Biden said the former KGB spy cannot remain in power. Russia denies Ukrainian and western accusations that its forces have committed war crimes since the 24 February invasion. A day before the symbolic Victory Day parade, the Black Sea city of Odesa came under repeated missile strikes. In Mariupol, the remaining Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal steelworks in the besieged port city staged a press conference on Sunday saying they had been 'abandoned' by the government as Russian attacks continued. Serhiy Gaidai, the Luhansk governor, where the bombed school was located, told the Guardian he believed the 30 people who escaped had been outside in the grounds of the building. He said he had little hope for those who were under rubble. 'Unfortunately, they are probably dead,' he said. 'Because the building collapsed. Besides, an air bomb is not a missile, its explosion produces extremely high temperatures. That's why most likely people haven't survived.' Putin has stated he intends to take the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions by 9 May when Russia marks Victory Day. In an address to mark Ukraine's 8 May remembrance and reconciliation day, Zelenskiy said his country paid homage to all those who helped defeat Adolf Hitler and accused Russia of repeating his crimes. He said: 'Every year on 8 May, together with the entire civilised world, we honour everyone who defended the planet from nazism during world war two. Millions of lost lives, crippled destinies, tortured souls and millions of reasons to say to evil: never again! 'We knew the price our ancestors paid for this wisdom. We knew how important it is to preserve it and pass it on to posterity. But we had no idea that our generation would witness the desecration of the words, which, as it turned out, are not the truth for everyone. 'This year we say 'Never again' differently. We hear 'Never again' differently. It sounds painful, cruel. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. You say: never again? Tell Ukraine about it.' Zelenskiy went on: 'On 24 February, the word 'never' was erased. Shot and bombed. By hundreds of missiles at 4am, which woke up the entire Ukraine. We heard terrible explosions. We heard: again!' Illya Samoilenko, a lieutenant in the Azov regiment in Mariupol, said his fellow soldiers would be executed if captured by the Russians and that surrender would be a 'gift' to the enemy. 'We are witnesses of Russian crimes,' he said, from the city's Azovstal steelworks. 'Surrender is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives.' Meanwhile, the last civilians rescued from the besieged complex reached safety in Ukrainian held territory late on Sunday evening. The journey of just over 200km took two days, as the convoy of buses was held for hours at Russian checkpoints and those inside interrogated.

Ben Wallace is also expected to accuse President Putin of hijacking the annual commemoration of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany - and to say the country's senior politicians and generals are complicit. 'Through their invasion of Ukraine, Putin, his inner circle and generals are now mirroring the fascism and tyranny of 70 years ago, repeating the errors of last century's totalitarian regimes,' Wallace will say in a speech at the National Army Museum in London. 'Their unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine, attacks against innocent citizens and their homes, and the widespread atrocities - including deliberately against women and children - corrupts the memory of past sacrifices and Russia's once-proud global reputation.' Soldiers and tanks not fighting in Ukraine will parade through Moscow and other Russian cities on Monday for the annual Victory Day parades, events that have taken on an increasing importance during Putin's 20 years in charge. But Wallace is expected to say that it is the presence of army generals that is particularly inappropriate, because they allow the Kremlin to make a false equivalence between the anti-fascist struggle of the second world war and the unprovoked attack on democratic Ukraine. 'Let's call out the absurdity of Russian generals - resplendent in their manicured parade uniforms and weighed down by their many medals - for being utterly complicit in Putin's hijacking of their forebears' proud history of defending against a ruthless invasion; of repelling fascism; of sacrificing themselves for a higher purpose,' the defence secretary is expected to say. Professional soldiers should also be appalled at the behaviour of Russia's army, Wallace will add. Moscow's forces have been accused of repeatedly bombing civilians, while failing to achieve the military objectives that had been set. 'Not only are they engaged in an illegal invasion and war crimes, but their top brass have failed their own rank and file to the extent they should be court-martialled,' he will say. Russia's military has become bogged down in Ukraine after more than two months fighting, including an aborted attempt to capture the capital Kyiv, and are trying to mass forces in the east to make territorial gains in attritional fighting in the Donbas region.", "a3cce6eaba2a1fcb260cde729d0b2577531ec97c995e915620c06bd7": "US first lady Jill Biden made an unannounced visit to western Ukraine on Sunday, holding a surprise Mother's Day meeting with the nation's first lady, Olena Zelenskiy, as Russia presses its punishing war in the eastern regions. US president Joe Biden has not visited the country, though he expressed a desire to when he was in Poland this spring, following Russia's invasion in February, but at that time Russian tanks were advancing on the capital, Kyiv, and he hinted that his security advisers held him back. Jill Biden traveled under the cloak of secrecy, becoming the latest high-profile American to enter Ukraine during its 10-week-old conflict with Russia. Russian forces drew back from Kyiv in the weeks after Biden's trip to Poland, and the return of a greater level of security in the capital prompted visits by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, days after US secretary of state Antony Blinken and defense secretary Lloyd Austin, and other world leaders, including British prime minister Boris Johnson, had met there with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. 'I wanted to come on Mother's Day,' Jill Biden told Olena Zelenskiy on Sunday. 'I thought it was important to show the Ukrainian people that this war has to stop and this war has been brutal and that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine.' The first lady traveled by vehicle to the town of Uzhhorod, about a 10-minute drive from a Slovakian village that borders Ukraine. The two came together in a small classroom, sitting across a table from one another and talking in front of reporters before they met in private. Zelenskiy and her children have been at an undisclosed location for their safety. Zelenskiy thanked Biden for her 'courageous act' and said: 'We understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war when military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are happening every day - even today.' The school where they met has been turned into transitional housing for Ukrainian migrants from elsewhere in the country. The visit allowed Biden to conduct the kind of personal diplomacy that her husband would like to be doing himself. The White House said as recently as last week that the US president 'would love to visit' but there were no plans for him to do so at this time. On Sunday, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau also made a surprise visit to Ukraine and was expected to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Earlier, the meeting between the two first ladies came about after they exchanged correspondence in recent weeks, according to US officials. Jill Biden drove through Uzhhorod and the meeting between the women lasted about an hour. Her visit was limited to western Ukraine. Russia is concentrating its military power in eastern Ukraine, and she was not deemed to be in harm's way. Earlier, in the Slovakian border village of Vysne Nemecke, she toured its border processing facility, surveying operations set up by the United Nations and other relief organizations to assist Ukrainians seeking refuge. Biden attended a religious service in a tent set up as a chapel, where a priest intoned: 'We pray for the people of Ukraine.' Before that, in Kosice, Biden met and offered support to Ukrainian mothers in Slovakia who have been displaced by Russia's war and assuring them that the 'hearts of the American people' are behind them. At a bus station in the city that is now a 24-hour refugee processing center, Biden found herself in an extended conversation with a Ukrainian woman who said she struggles to explain the war to her three children because she cannot understand it herself. 'I cannot explain because I don't know myself and I'm a teacher,' Victorie Kutocha, who had her arms around her 7-year-old daughter, Yulie, told Biden. At one point, Kutocha asked, 'Why?' seeming to seek an explanation for Russia's decision to invade Ukraine on February 24. 'It's so hard to understand,' the first lady replied. Meanwhile, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, acting ambassador Kristina Kvien, temporarily returned to the US embassy in Kyiv, according to an unnamed US official, weeks after it was vacated.", "4763e115c2a0d1ac8fe5a639ccda1eddeb3303c1675b728b6e4d7a5a": "Members of Ukraine's Azov battalion trapped inside Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant have said they fear they will be killed if captured by Russian forces, as they pleaded with Ukrainian authorities to help arrange their extraction. Speaking to the media from inside the besieged steelworks, an Azov commander and lieutenant, looking gaunt and pale, said they had defended the city for the people of Ukraine and the rest of the world and needed a third party to negotiate their exit whether by land or sea. There are believed to be 2,000 soldiers in the plant, 700 of whom are said to be wounded. Lieut Illya Samoilenko vowed to fight on, saying his comrades understood they would be killed if captured and that surrender would be a 'gift' to the enemy. 'We are witnesses of Russian crimes,' Samoilenko said. 'Surrender is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives.' All the civilians who were inside the plant have been evacuated, according to Azov's commander, Denys Prokopenko. 'We need the proper opportunity to be evacuated,' Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment. 'Another thing that hurts is that the politicians said you continue (fighting) while we evacuate the civilians. But we (are) here defending the people.' They criticised the Ukrainian government for celebrating the evacuation of several dozen civilians over the past few weeks, while failing to prepare Ukraine over the past eight years for what they say was an inevitable war with Russia. 'The government let this happen to 25,000 people,' said Samoilenko, speaking of the number of civilians in Mariupol that he estimates have died. Azov forces say they are more than 100km from the nearest Ukrainian forces and cannot make it to safety without help from Ukraine's authorities. The Azov battalion has been central to Russia's justification for invading Ukraine. Russia claims its members are neo-Nazis who are responsible for 'Nazifying' Ukraine. Azov fighters say its membership holds a range of political opinions. Azov formed as a volunteer battalion in 2014 to fight Russian-backed forces and some its leaders are known to hold far-right views. But since 2015, it has been part of the Ukrainian army and no longer attracts only far-right combatants. Russian propaganda has long exaggerated the domestic influence of Azov in Ukraine as well as the scale of its membership. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has worked to transform the image of the fighters internationally and in Ukraine. Many now view them as heroes. Samoilenko said they felt supported by words but asked for aerial attacks on Russian positions and berated the Ukrainian authorities for not defending Ukraine's southern regions. 'We are doing our job and we are doing our job well. Some of the politicians are not doing their job well,' said Samoilenko, who also said Azov had killed 2,500 Russian soldiers from 24 February to 25 April. Samoilenko said the weak reaction of the world to Russian aggression in 2014 is one of the reasons why this invasion had happened. He said western countries should have understood that the price of prosperity in Europe had been 15,000 Ukrainian lives in the last eight years, referring to the 2014-22 war, when he said the west had refused to help the battalion. 'We showed that anything is possible,' said Samoilenko. 'Please do your job and so we can teach people how to do impossible things.' Samoilenko also criticised the Ukrainian government for negotiating with Russia, describing them as 'barbarians'. He said Azov's goal was to eliminate the enemy threat by pacifying Russia and that they were not only fighting for Ukraine but the whole of the free world. Samoilenko declined to say how many soldiers were left in the plant or talk about their supplies, saying that this was classified operational information. The fighters say morale is still high, despite coming under almost constant shelling. 'We're grateful for the support from the world and this may help,' said Samoilenko 'People have seen who we are.'", "ad87113db60e19085a5110822755cf07709db42dc553dc5a2e8aa685": "Ukraine will prevail over Russia as freedom prevailed over the Nazi dictatorship in 1945, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will say in a TV address to mark the 77th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, in which he will accuse Vladimir Putin of falsifying history. In the speech, which will be aired on German TV at 8.20pm CET (7.20pm BST) on Sunday, Scholz says the 'legacy of 8 May' for his country must be to help to ensure that there will never again be genocide or tyranny in Europe. 'I am deeply convinced. Putin will not win the war,' the centre-left politician says. 'Ukraine will prevail. Freedom and safety will win, just like freedom and safety triumphed over servitude, violence and dictatorship 77 years ago.' Scholz says it is 'falsifying history and disgraceful' of Russia's president to equate his own 'barbaric war of aggression' with the fight against National Socialism. 'It is our duty to state this clearly,' his speech says. In keeping with previous postwar German leaders' messages on 8 May, Scholz thanks the Allied forces for their defeat of Nazi Germany, and says his country owes a debt to both Russia and Ukraine, which suffered millions of casualties in the second world war. Scholz has repeatedly declared Germany's support for Ukraine's defensive effort but diplomatic relations between Berlin and Kyiv have been frosty. Ukrainian diplomats have accused his left-liberal coalition government of stalling over embargoes on Russian energy and deliveries of military hardware. The chancellor, meanwhile, appeared personally piqued after Germany's president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, previously a Social Democratic party (SPD) ally, was told last month he was not welcome to visit Kyiv along with eastern European leaders. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week he had made up with Steinmeier and invited Scholz to pay a symbolic visit to Ukraine's capital on 9 May. The German leader did not give any indication on Sunday of whether he was likely to accept or not. Several European politicians have visited Ukraine since the start of the war in late February, including the leader of the German parliamentary opposition. Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, made a surprise visit to Irpin on Sunday, and the US president's wife, Jill Biden, met Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, during an unannounced visit to the west of the country. In what she called an 'icebreaker' visit, the president of the Bundestag, Barbel Bas, also travelled to Kyiv on Sunday to commemorate the victims of the second world war, laying wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with her Ukrainian counterpart, Ruslan Stefanchuk, the chair of the Verkhovna Rada. 'To me this day is special because it does not merely commemorate but should serve to reconcile,' said Bas, whose presiding role over sessions in Germany's legislature is comparable to that of the speaker in other parliaments. The SPD politician said her visit was meant to commemorate all victims of the second world war, those in Ukraine as well as Russia, Poland, Belarus, the Baltic States and other states in central and eastern Europe. Public figures in Berlin, meanwhile, stayed away from gatherings to mark the anniversary of Nazi Germany's surrender over fears that commemorative events could be used for propaganda purposes. 'The situation is very oppressive, and any commemorations have to take that into account,' said Berlin's mayor, Franziska Giffey, justifying her and her senators' absence at the traditional laying of wreaths at the Soviet War Memorial in the city's Treptower Park. The Russian embassy in the German capital, which has organised the event in the past, has not made its plans public this year because of security concerns. Germany's surrender is traditionally celebrated in western Europe on 8 May, but because time zones it is marked on 9 May in Russia, Belarus, Serbia and Israel. Berlin's senator for interior affairs, Iris Spranger, said police would seek to suppress any public displays of support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 8 and 9 May, including the beeping of horns at car rallies. About 1,000 people attended a pro-Russia rally at Cologne's Fuhlinger lake on Sunday, waving the red-white-and-blue flag of the modern Russian republic and the red flag of the former Soviet Union. The display of Russian flags in the vicinity of 15 memorial sites in Berlin was banned. The city's decision to also include Ukrainian flags in its ban has been heavily criticised by the country's ambassador to Germany. Andrij Melnyk said the ban, which exempts flag displays by diplomats, was 'a slap in the face of the Ukrainian people'.", "6cdd855979dc4c8e2f5bfb44433df497c4b40489f930a4808a22104d": "Polls opened in the Philippines on Monday as the country decides its next president in a polarising race between frontrunner Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son of the late dictator, and a human rights lawyer who has vowed to tackle old, rotten politics. Opinion surveys suggest Marcos Jr, known as Bongbong, is poised to win the election, despite his family's notorious history of human rights abuses and corruption. The Marcoses plundered as much as $10bn from the state, while thousands of his opponents were arrested, tortured and killed. Analysts say the Marcoses and their supporters have harnessed the power of social media to rebrand the family name and spread disinformation that downplays or denies past atrocities. False claims have been spread widely online, portraying Marcos Sr's rule as a golden age of prosperity and peace. Marcos Jr denies any coordinated online network. Marcos Jr has not apologised for his family's political history, and instead praised his father as a 'political genius', and his mother, Imelda, as the dynasty's 'supreme politician' during a recent interview. Imelda Marcos, infamous for her collection of 3,000 pairs of shoes, is appealing against a 2018 criminal conviction on seven graft charges. Marcos Jr, whose slogan is 'together we shall rise again', has campaigned with a message of unity and rekindling a former greatness. He is running in tandem with the daughter of populist president Rodrigo Duterte, Sara, who is vying for the vice-presidency, an arrangement that has further boosted the Marcos camp. President Duterte remains popular as he nears the end of his six-year term limit, despite attracting condemnation from rights groups over his bloody so-called 'war on drugs'. He has not endorsed a presidential candidate. Opinion surveys suggest Marcos is far ahead of his opponents. One recent poll found he was the preferred candidate of 56% of respondents. Marcos' biggest threat is Leni Robredo, the current vice-president and a former pro bono human rights lawyer, who has promised good and competent governance. As vice-president - a position elected separately from the president - she has frequently clashed with president Rodrigo Duterte, and has condemned his 'war on drugs', which has killed as many as 30,000 people according to some estimates, and prompted an investigation by the international criminal court. Robredo's campaign has gathered momentum in the run-up to the election, with large crowds attending her rallies and almost 2 million people, many of them young voters, volunteering to go door to door to win support for her campaign. About 67 million people are eligible to vote, with polling stations opening from 6am on Monday for a longer period of 13 hours to ensure social distancing. Vote counting will begin as soon as the ballots close, and in the past the winner has become apparent within hours. However, some analysts say Covid measures may slow down the process this year, and have speculated that the race could be tighter than polling suggests, pointing to the large turnouts at Robredo's rallies. The Philippine police and military said on Sunday they were on high alert ahead of the vote, with the armed forces chief, Lt Gen Andres Centino, stating they were committed to ensuring 'secure, accurate, free and fair elections'. The winner will take office on 30 June and lead for a single, six-year term.", "c17f70a9203ed0f2ade63dea3966309dabc252c68ea5f82e68c1da4f": "Barclays has avoided nearly PS2bn in tax via a lucrative arrangement in Luxembourg that allowed it to pay less than 1% on profits in the tax haven for more than a decade. A Guardian analysis of Barclays' tax bills shows it is still benefiting from a controversial decision in 2009, in which it booked profits from the $15.2bn sale of a fund management business in Luxembourg rather than in the UK where it is headquartered. By booking the profits overseas, Barclays was able to take advantage of a complex scheme whereby it could offset future profits against a drop in the value of company shares it acquired as part of the deal. The decision has resulted in Barclays earning billions of pounds nearly tax-free for more than 12 years, and has raised questions about whether it influenced the bank's strategy in investing or growing the Luxembourg business at the expense of other locations, including the UK. The senior Labour MP Margaret Hodge said: 'These revelations that Barclays is using a scheme in an infamous tax haven leaves the British-headquartered bank with important questions to answer. 'Why is Barclays setting up shop in Luxembourg at all, other than to avoid tax? Does this artificial financial arrangement mean that profits are shifted away from the UK, thus harming our tax coffers? Or have business investments been channelled through this tax haven instead of in Britain, harming our economy in the process?' Barclays employs only 54 staff in Luxembourg, but it is currently the bank's third most profitable jurisdiction behind the US and UK, with turnover of PS1.1bn last year. Low staff costs mean Barclays can turn nearly all of that income from corporate and investment banking into profit. The bank has 46,000 staff in the UK and nearly 10,000 in the US. Cumulatively, Barclays' Luxembourg operations have made PS6.6bn in profits since 2013, according to annual tax documents released by the bank. Thanks to the generous tax arrangement, it has paid only PS46m on those earnings, or about 1%. Barclays could have been taxed between 25 and 30% had it not taken advantage of rules allowing it to offset losses linked to $9bn-worth of shares acquired through the sale of its Barclays Global Investors (BGI) business to the US fund manager BlackRock in 2009. It means the bank could have saved PS1.9bn in tax over the period, though the collective savings are likely to be much higher because it only started releasing country-by-country tax information in 2013 in response to EU rules. Reuters first revealed the tax arrangement in 2016, but the extent of the benefits were not known. Barclays has not referenced the BGI deal by name in its annual tax reports, but has said for years that its low tax bills are because of previous losses. 'We paid no corporation tax in Luxembourg in 2021 as our taxable profits were offset by substantial tax losses brought forward from prior years, and also due to dividend income not being taxable under Luxembourg law', its 2021 report stated. 'We have unused tax losses which are automatically carried forward, and available to offset against future taxable profits.' Barclays said in a statement: 'The structure of the BGI sale was not aimed at securing a tax reduction but intended to secure a simpler and more certain tax treatment and avoid volatility in the bank's regulatory capital.' It said it had not booked any profits from other jurisdictions in Luxembourg, and stressed that it paid more than PS14bn in taxes in the UK over the past decade. Barclays' Luxembourg operations, which were established in 2007, have courted controversy before. The bank's former chief executive Antony Jenkins pledged to shut down a unit in the Grand Duchy that helped wealthy customers avoid tax in 2013. At the time, the bank was reporting profits of around PS1.4bn, about PS100m for each of the 14 people employed there. The winding down of the unit resulted in a drop in local profits in subsequent years, falling as low as PS318m in 2018. Barclays, however, announced fresh investment in 2019, helping profits rebound to more than PS1.1bn by 2020. It involved expanding services for its multinational clients, despite its staff base only increasing to just over 50 employees. Today the bank offers a range of services out of Luxembourg, which it said was focused on serving local clients and offering cash management, debt, foreign exchange and trade finance.", "f32847687ff1ec8fe43c9567a93410ead3240890412a704ceb0ea519": "", "e7ba5c7649cdf6938542f962f84d8b51bbb71f2925bfb81d0539e8ad": "The Democratic Unionist party is to seek an urgent meeting with Boris Johnson to warn him it will stall power-sharing at Stormont until Christmas if the Northern Ireland protocol is not modified. A senior party figure said it will push the responsibility for Stormont back on to the prime minister: 'We will say he has a choice: Stormont or the protocol.' The ultimatum came as the UK justice secretary, Dominic Raab, pledged to do 'whatever necessary' to alter the protocol, which mandates checks on goods crossing into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. But the DUP's trust in the Conservative party, which was already at a low ebb, was shattered last week when the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, hinted the government was pulling back from threats to introduce laws to unilaterally disapply parts of the protocol. The party's leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, will lay out his concerns in a statement on Tuesday following the Queen's speech in the House of Commons. The Queen's speech is expected to include a commitment to protect the interests of the unionist community and the Good Friday agreement, but the DUP says it will not go as far as it wants. The re-elected DUP MLA for Upper Bann, Jonathan Buckley, told the Belfast Telegraph on Sunday that Lewis also needed to take responsibility for changing the protocol: 'Either the secretary of state wants an executive or the protocol, he can't have both.' Lewis has said he will meet all the Northern Ireland party leaders in the coming days but the DUP will stick to its position that it has support for a boycott of Stormont and only an intervention by London can restore power-sharing. 'We can stall this until Christmas,' said one senior DUP insider. The party argues that despite the surge in support for Sinn Fein in last week's election, the majority of Stormont seats (35) have gone to unionist parties - 25 to the DUP, nine to the UUP and one to the Traditional Unionist Voice party. Doug Beattie, the Ulster Unionist leader, said he had been invited to meet Lewis on Monday and expected the Stormont assembly to resume work this week regardless of the formation of an executive. 'I expect all our MLAs to be there. We have a lot to be getting on with.' Claire Sugden, an independent unionist who held her seat in East Derry, said she favoured forming an executive as soon as possible. 'I appreciate there are issues with the protocol but I want to see an executive now, up and running.' The protocol was not a constitutional issue but a logistical one that required fixing, she said. Sugden said she would not join any party at Stormont, adding: 'The people elected me as an independent.' There has been speculation the DUP might try to co-opt independent unionist MLAs to overtake Sinn Fein's numerical superiority. One insider in Belfast said the party required substantial reform of the protocol, with one of their MPs warning they needed to see all the European court of justice's role extinguished - which was previously a sticking point in negotiations with the EU. 'All the energy in unionism right now is on the right and is demanding serious changes.' DUP insiders say they will press home to the prime minister that new laws designed to prevent a future collapse of the assembly also give it the power to delay formation of the executive for up to six months. Under legislation passed in February the parties have six weeks following the opening of the assembly to form an executive. If they fail to do so they can be given three further six-week extensions. If there is no executive by the end of the 24 weeks, then the Northern Ireland secretary must call an election, which must be held within 12 weeks. The deputy leader of the centrist Alliance party, Stephen Farry, which more than doubled its seats in the assembly election, could prove an ally to the DUP. Farry said at the weekend it had to be recognised more widely that the protocol needed to be changed, but he called for a 'pragmatic approach' with all parties working together in Stormont rather than another showdown with Brussels.", "598f758486c2b6aa42212d257cb68e5b3bb64dee2fea6f6de43ef9ab": "Carolyn Egan has seen people cross the Canada-US border for abortions - going north to south. In the years before Canada's supreme court legalised abortion in 1988, it was common for Canadians who needed abortions to travel to the US. 'We had a network of people who could make referrals and help them get there [to the US]. If it's necessary, that probably would happen again - but the other way,' said Egan, spokesperson for the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada. If, as a leaked draft decision indicates, the US supreme court votes to overturn Roe v Wade, many Americans in need of surgical abortion could be forced to travel not just across state lines but, once again, across international borders - both along the northern border to Canada and the southern one to Mexico. On Tuesday, Canada's minister of families, Karina Gould, reaffirmed that Americans can access abortion services in Canada. 'If they, people, come here and need access, certainly, you know, that's a service that would be provided,' she told CBC News. An estimated 26 states are likely to ban abortion if Roe v Wade is overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an American sexual and reproductive health rights research organization. That includes Michigan, which sits across the water from southern Ontario, where there are plenty of abortion clinics. 'If a state like Michigan banned abortion, certainly there would be interest in coming across the border,' Egan said. Michigan has a 1931 ban that could automatically kick in when Roe v Wade ends. Michigan residents could also travel to Illinois or Pennsylvania, as those states are unlikely to outlaw the procedure, according to Guttmacher data, and many Americans would be expected to travel internally between states. Those travelling internationally won't find it free - people without immigration status in Canada are charged about C$500 (US$388) for a surgical abortion, Egan said - but Americans do not need a health card to access clinics in Canada. Wait times vary, from one to two weeks in Ontario to several weeks or months in the Atlantic provinces. Crossing the border will probably only be possible for those who can afford to do. Abortion advocates in the US have underscored that after Roe v Wade falls it will be wealthier white women who have the means - including travelling - to access abortion, while people on lower incomes and those who face socioeconomic barriers including African American, Latino and Indigenous women and transgender people may struggle more. 'You have to have the financial resources' to travel between states or internationally, Doherty said. 'There will be a limited number of people who will be able to do that.' She added that not everyone has dependable childcare, the ability to take time off work or a valid passport. The cheapest option early in pregnancy will probably continue to be abortion pills, obtainable either through the mail or via telehealth services. But after working for more than 10 years at clinics in Ireland while abortion was illegal, Doherty says she has no doubt that people will cross borders. 'Over 5,000 women a year travelled to the UK, so we know that abortion restrictions don't stop women from accessing abortion - it just places more burden on them.' South of the US border, Mexican advocates are preparing for an increase in Americans visiting to access abortion services. In 2021, Mexico's supreme court ruled it was unconstitutional to criminalise abortion, although access still varies by state.  The advocacy group Las Libres is part of a network that helps people on both sides of the border access abortion pills. Vero Cruz, advocacy coordinator with Las Libres, said Americans can technically obtain surgical abortions in public clinics in certain Mexican states for free, though she doesn't know of anyone who has done so yet. Cruz said surgical abortions were available in Sinaloa, Coahuila and Baja California, but only up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. 'The women who are crossing into Mexico are coming to Monterrey, Tijuana and other cities to have abortions using medication,' she said. The abortion pills are free, too. 'It's completely free, it costs nothing.' She said both private and public clinics in border cities in Mexico were planning for an American influx; both Tijuana and Coahuila recently set up services, she said. Egan said Americans in Canada will be warmly received, too. 'For a cabinet minister to say that Americans would be welcome here, gives the sense that the government is considering the possibility, and making it clear they would not be interfering in that.' Many Canadians are upset about the looming end of Roe v Wade, she said. 'There's tremendous upset, distress and anger that Americans would be in the situation of having to face this kind of thing. So my sense is people will do everything they can to make access easier.'", "349d538671666071364bde59ff630decd85dd33569c63edfacc00de0": "Labour has rejected claims that a leaked planning memo about Keir Starmer's visit to Durham last year undermined his assertion he did not break lockdown laws, insisting he is 'Mr Rules'. The Labour document, published by the Mail on Sunday, shows that an 80-minute dinner with the Labour MP Mary Foy, featuring a takeaway curry, was planned as part of his schedule. Starmer has repeatedly claimed that the meal, at which he was pictured drinking beer, did not break lockdown rules because he was eating in the course of work, and not attending a social event. The announcement by Durham police on Friday that they were reopening their investigation into the event has led Tories to accuse the Labour leader of hypocrisy as he called for Boris Johnson's resignation when police opened an investigation into lockdown breaches at No 10. Tories argued the memo was evidence the meal was in breach of lockdown rules because it showed that it was prearranged - to take place between 8.40pm and 10pm - and not just a spontaneous decision to order food as work extended into the evening, as Starmer's account of the evening has implied. Starmer has also claimed that after his meal he continued working. But the leaked schedule showed that after the meal he was due to return to his hotel. In a separate report, the Sunday Times quoted an unnamed source who was present at the gathering saying Starmer did not return to work after his meal and that Foy and her staff were not present for work purposes, but just for a drink. 'Mary Foy and her staff were not working and I have not got a problem telling that to the police. They were just getting pissed. They were just there for a jolly,' the source told the paper.  Foy said: 'Me and my team were working during a very busy period. Including facilitating the leader's visit. I do not believe either I or my office broke any rules and I will of course fully engage with any police investigation.' In a tweet at the weekend, Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, claimed the memo showed Labour's account of the evening was 'a lie'. Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that Starmer was guilty of 'rank double standards'. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, told the same programme the leaked memo confirmed Starmer was on a work visit when he was in Durham on 30 April 2021. She said Starmer was the victim of 'an absolutely desperate attempt to sling mud' and that it was 'absurd' to equate this with a prime minister under investigation for 12 separate gatherings, including 'karaoke parties, bring your own bottle parties, pub quizzes [and] suitcases full of wine being smuggled through the back door'. She added: 'The prime minister lied about that ... Keir Starmer went on a work visit and had a break to eat. The idea that this is the same sort of thing is just a sign of a government that is tired, and is desperate and is completely out of ideas. 'This is a guy who's self-isolated six times during the pandemic, I don't know a single other person who did that. 'He is Mr Rules, he does not break the rules, he was the director of public prosecutions, not somebody who goes around tearing up rules when it suits him, in stark contrast to the prime minister.' Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister and a specialist in lockdown rules, said the Labour memo could be used to clear Starmer of allegations he broke the law.  'Seeing that this was a scheduled event as part of the leader of the opposition's visit to Durham - during a local election campaign, an event focused on him being with a local MP and their staff, and it was in the evening and food was ordered because it was the evening - I don't really see how it could be a breach of the regulations,' he said. 'The regulations allowed for any gathering that was reasonably necessary for work or voluntary activity. And obviously the purpose of that visit overall was for the leader of the opposition to visit the local campaigners and the local MP and that is all on the schedule. 'So the police would have to say: 'Well we actually disagree with the Labour party's analysis of what was reasonably necessary for the leader's trip to Durham,' and I am doubtful that they could really go behind that reasoning.' Wagner said the No 10 Partygate events were quite different. 'The issue with the Downing Street events was that they were prearranged social events. Those being investigated are the ones where it's quite obvious that the purpose of the event was social - a Christmas party, a leaving party, a birthday party. Whereas the fact that this is pre-planned I think shows the opposite. It shows that the purpose was political.'", "9875fbb22ac103a8a30d11fac1cec8a9df2eaa02cd51f7d8d340aeac": "The UK is under pressure to insist India release Jagtar Singh Johal, a British citizen, after a UN working group ruled he had been arbitrarily detained by India and his detention lacked any legal basis. Boris Johnson apparently raised the case when he met the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, last month and provided a written note of consular cases, but Foreign Office ministers have not confirmed whether they regard his detention as arbitrary. Johal was arrested after his wedding in the Punjab in November 2017, accused of helping to fund a Sikh-on-Hindu assassination plot - something that he and his family strongly deny. In what is being described as a watershed moment in the case, the UN panel on arbitrary detention concluded that the 'continued pre-trial detention of Mr Johal lacks legal basis, and is arbitrary' because he was abducted by plainclothes officers without an arrest warrant, held incommunicado and denied consular assistance or access to a lawyer. They observe that there is 'no judicially admissible evidence against Johal, despite intelligence agencies having over three years to investigate' and conclude that 'the appropriate remedy would be to release Johal immediately'. Johal has claimed he was tortured and forced to sign blank confession statements, and then had extra charges laid against him that had now reached a total of nine cases. He was transferred to Nabha maximum security prison, where he remained until 25 May 2019, before being transferred to a prison in Delhi. The UN report says that despite being in jail for more than four years he has not been charged and no admissible evidence has been produced. The report by the UN working group on arbitrary detention claims 'Johal was targeted because of his activities as a Sikh practitioner and supporter and because of his activism writing public posts calling for accountability for alleged actions committed against Sikhs by the authorities'. It adds that he 'was deprived of his liberty on discriminatory grounds, owing to his status as a human rights defender and based on his political activism, religious faith and opinions'. The Indian government denies torture, and says it is still compiling evidence in the cases. Jagtar's brother Gurpreet Singh Johal, who has been fighting for his release, was elected a Labour councillor in the Scottish local elections in Dunbarton last week. He said: 'We've known from the start that there's no good reason for Jagtar's imprisonment and in four years the Indian authorities haven't produced any evidence against him. The UK government hasn't listened to us, but perhaps it will listen to the UN and call for his release. There have been so many setbacks but on a day like this, we're dreaming of the moment my brother steps off a plane in Scotland to be reunited with his family.' The co-executive director of the human rights group Reprieve, Maya Foa, said: 'This is a watershed moment. There is no longer any excuse for the government's continued failure to call for Jagtar's release and return. When a British citizen is tortured and held in pre-trial detention for four years, facing a potential death sentence, the prime minister's responsibility is clear. What is Boris Johnson waiting for?' The Foreign Office says it has raised the case more than 70 times at various levels and that the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has offered to meet the family to discuss the case.", "e0fd2b7ed8ef18f17b5e4e8daf910463f1e7f4c626ae4b57c9e4f992": "The New York Times has removed the word 'fetus' from its Wordle answers to keep the game 'distinct from the news', a move apparently related to last week's leaked Roe v Wade supreme court draft ruling.

'Today, some users may see an outdated answer for Wordle that seems closely connected to a major recent news event. This is entirely unintentional and a coincidence - today's original answer was loaded into Wordle last year,' the New York Times  said in a statement.

Last week's leaked supreme court draft majority opinion supported overturning the landmark Roe v Wade decision, putting in jeopardy rights to abortion across the United States and sparking a bitter national debate. 'At New York Times Games, we take our role seriously as a place to entertain and escape, and we want Wordle to remain distinct from the news,' the Times said.  It's not the first time Wordle has offered up different solutions. In March, baffled users tweeted their confusion over two correct Wordle answers.

A nine-day mini-heatwave is hitting the UK, which coincides with the return of migratory birds here to breed. Many of these birds have flown thousands of miles on their journey. But conservationists are concerned that the ground is getting so hard it could stop them from being able to make their nests. By leaving out dishes of mud mixed with water, or creating little puddles in the garden, the public can make a big difference, said Becca Smith, of the RSPB. 'It's the easiest thing that people can do to help these birds after they've flown all the way from Africa to our shores. Plus, a bit of mud pie-making is fun for the weekend.' Putting out dishes of fresh water will also provide drinking and bathing for a variety of birds. House martins - which require the most mud for nestbuilding - can mix water with soil themselves, which they then combine with things such as grass, feathers and vegetable fibres to make little cup nests under the eaves of houses. 'Having the mud already created for them is the easiest option for these birds,' said Smith. 'It's a bit like getting a McDonald's as opposed to having to go out and get all the ingredients yourself and trying to recreate a Big Mac.' Mud pies should not be too sloppy, but also should not dry out. Smith recommends checking them a couple of times a day to make sure they are still wet enough. She says it's good to leave birds water and mud every year between March and May, especially if it is dry, because this is a very busy time of year for them. Some migratory birds have arrived later this year because there have been persistent easterly and north-easterly winds, which make it harder for them to fly northwards. According to Marco Petagna at the Met Office, UK temperatures are 'several degrees above where they should be at this time of year'. In December 2021, swift and house martins joined the UK red list of endangered birds in the latest IUCN update. Swift populations have fallen by 58% since 1995. These migratory birds have suffered from the loss of nesting sites as old buildings are renovated, and also the loss of insects - their food supply. A UK study this week found flying insect numbers have plunged by 60% since 2004. The RSPB also recommends putting up artificial nests and boxes to provide more nesting opportunities for these birds, as well as creating insect-friendly gardens. Alexander Lees, senior lecturer in conservation biology at Manchester Metropolitan University, said the RSPB's recommendations look useful. 'More broadly, we need building regulations that mandate spaces for swifts and house martins, and to make sure that any nest boxes are cited appropriately on cooler and shady north or east-facing walls,' he said. 'Given that the loss of insect abundance is likely to be strongly affected by artificial light at night, then we can all make the effort where possible to turn lights off, saving insects, their predators and saving on our energy bills. We need to stop stealing the darkness from the natural world.'", "ef18261099e4391ed4dba60f17f932b6f5c2aba833c7262f802219cc": "Scientists studying the DNA of the world's smallest cetacean and rarest marine mammal, the vaquita porpoise, have made a surprising and bittersweet discovery. With a tiny population of fewer than 10 individuals left, the mammal was assumed by conservationists to be at a similar risk of harmful mutations and inbreeding as other species with small gene pools. However, a team of international researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries (NOAA) and other institutes found that the porpoises (Phocoena sinus) have fewer harmful mutations and are thus likely to be better at avoiding the perils of inbreeding, relative to other species. Unfortunately for the animals, which have a very small geographical range and only live in the upper part of the Gulf of California, between Baja California and Mexico, the biggest threat it faces is illegal fishing with gillnets - flat nets suspended vertically in the water that are notorious for also trapping whales and turtles. If that does not stop immediately, experts say, the species is unlikely to survive. Christopher Kyriazis, a UCLA doctoral student in ecology and a co-lead author of the research, said: 'Interestingly, we found the vaquita is not doomed by genetic factors, like harmful mutations, that tend to affect many other species whose gene pool has diminished to a similar point. Outlawed fishing remains their biggest threat.' The small porpoises, about 1.2-1.5 metres (4-5ft) long, often become entangled and die in the large mesh gillnets poachers use to hunt the totoaba, an endangered fish that fetches thousands of dollars on China's black market for its perceived medicinal properties. While Mexico has banned totoaba fishing and the use of gillnets in the vaquita's habitat, many say the ban is not always enforced. The researchers analysed the genomes of 20 vaquitas that lived between 1985 and 2017, and used models to predict its extinction risk over 50 years. They concluded that if gillnet fishing ended immediately, the vaquita had a very high chance of recovery from its population crash, without suffering the genetic consequences of inbreeding. If, however, the practice continues, even moderately, the prospects of recovery are less optimistic. The research is being published in the journal Science. Kirk Lohmueller, senior co-author and UCLA associate professor of ecology, said: 'A prevailing view in conservation biology and population genetics is that small populations can accumulate deleterious mutations. However, our finding that the vaquita likely has fewer strongly deleterious mutations hiding in the population means that they are better poised to survive future inbreeding, which bodes well for their overall recovery.' The vaquita's small population and habitat make it the marine equivalent of an island species, the researchers said. The population has plummeted from 576 to seven or eight over the last decade, due to the rise in the illegal totoaba trade.", "97e1404d0b7bfb05e7af576c67ac8c41773f304ade7270d832fc7f53": "A Nasa climate research scientist who has spent much of her career explaining how global food production must adapt to a changing climate was awarded the World Food prize on Thursday. Cynthia Rosenzweig, an agronomist and climatologist, was awarded the $250,000 prize in recognition of her innovative modeling of the impact of climate change on food production. She is a senior research scientist at the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies and serves as adjunct senior research scientist at the Columbia Climate School at Columbia University, both based in New York. Rosenzweig, whose win was announced during a ceremony at the state department in Washington, said she hopes it will focus attention on the need to improve food and agricultural systems to lessen the effects of climate change. 'We basically cannot solve climate change unless we address the issues of the greenhouse gas emissions from the food system, and we cannot provide food security for all unless we work really hard to develop resilient systems,' she told the Associated Press during an interview ahead of the ceremony. Jose Fernandez, the undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment, said more than 160 million people worldwide experienced food insecurity last year, a 19% increase over the year before, and one of the root causes is a decline in food production due to global warming. 'Climate change has already had a significant and negative impact on global agricultural production and its impact is only going to get worse. We're seeing rice fields drown in floods. We're seeing other crops wither in drought. We're seeing shellfish die in more acidic oceans and crop diseases are spreading to new regions. We likely would not understand all these problems as well as we do today without the work of Dr Cynthia Rosenzweig, this year's World Food prize laureate,' he said. The Des Moines-based World Food Prize Foundation award recognized Rosenzweig as the founder of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project. The organization draws scientists from around the world and from many disciplines to advance methods for improving predictions of the future performance of agricultural and food systems as the global climate changes. The foundation credited her work with directly helping decision-makers in more than 90 countries establish plans to prepare for climate change. In her work, Rosenzweig has studied how farmers can deal with climate change and how agriculture worsens the problem. For example, she contributed to a research paper published last month that said global agri-food systems create nearly one-third of the total global greenhouse gases emitted by human activity. Rosenzweig said the world needs to reduce such emissions and adapt to the changing climate. She noted that greenhouse gases come from many parts of food production, including the release of carbon and carbon dioxide through the clearing of forests for farmland and the oxidization of carbon through the plowing of fields. The use of fertilizer also releases atmospheric nitrous oxide, farm equipment emits fossil fuels and cattle release methane. Rosenzweig, who describes herself as a climate impact scientist, grew up in Scarsdale, New York, a suburban area that she said led her to seek out life in the country. She moved to Tuscany, Italy, with her husband-to-be in her 20s and developed a passion for agriculture. Upon returning to the United States, she focused her education on agronomy. She worked as a graduate student at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in the early 1980s, when global climate models were beginning to show the effects of human generated carbon dioxide on the global climate. As the only team member studying agronomy, she researched the impact on food production and has been working since then to answer those questions, she said. Rosenzweig's work led to the Environmental Protection Agency's first projections of the effect of climate change on the nation's agricultural regions in the agency's assessment of the potential effects of climate change on the United States in 1988. She was the first to bring climate change to the attention of the American Society of Agronomy and she organized the first sessions on the issue in the 1980s. She completed the first projections of how climate change will affect food production in North America in 1985 and globally in 1994, and she was one of the first scientists to document that climate change was already affecting food production and cultivation. The research organization she founded, AgMIP, develops adaptation packages, which could include the use of more drought-tolerant seeds and improved water management practices. In Bangladesh the group is working with rice farmers to develop new practices for managing rice paddies to reduce the significant release of methane produced by the existing process. She said even the largest agribusiness corporations have shown a willingness to listen. She said some models colleagues have developed show how businesses could be effected by climate change and how they too have a role to play in reversing impact on climate. 'It's really a global partnership of all the global food system to come together to restrain climate change and maintain the food security for the planet,' she said. The World Food Prize Foundation president, Barbara Stinson, who announced the winner, credited Rosenzweig for innovations that helped countries respond to climate change. Nobel prize laureate Norman Borlaug created the World Food prize in 1986 to recognize scientists and others who have improved the quality and availability of food. Rosenzweig will receive the award and make a speech during an October ceremony in Des Moines.", "5fc8c284423dc20c900a3f39c7f2811026143743d4d630cbd0b2acc3": "Two Palestinians believed to have killed three people in a terrorist attack on Israel's independence day - the latest incident in the worst wave of attacks in Israel in years - have been apprehended by police after a three-day manhunt. The suspects, identified as As'ad Yousef As'ad al-Rifa'i, 19, Subhi Emad Subhi Abu Shqeir, 20, both from the occupied West Bank village of Rumana, were caught near a quarry outside the town of Elad in central Israel on Sunday, according to a statement by Israel's police, military and internal security agency. A massive search to locate the pair had been under way since Thursday night, when two attackers armed with an axe and knife stabbed people during independence day celebrations in Elad, an ultra-Orthdox town. Israeli media identified those killed as Yonatan Havakuk, Boaz Gol and Oren Ben Yiftah, fathers in their 30s and 40s who together are survived by 16 children. Four more people were injured. Ben Yiftah, a driver, was hired to pick up the assailants near a breach in Israel's West Bank security fence without knowing they had crossed the barrier illegally, Israeli officials said last week. On arrival in Elad, they killed him before moving on to target passersby. The perpetrators then fled the scene, sparking a huge search operation involving special forces, commando units, drones and helicopters, before they surrendered to masked soldiers in a rugged patch of land outside the town early on Sunday. A spate of deadly street attacks targeting Israelis, accompanied by violent clashes at al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police, have sent tensions soaring in recent weeks. Eighteen Israelis, including an Arab-Israeli police officer and two Ukrainian nationals, have been killed in five separate incidents. Three Arab-Israelis and 27 Palestinians have died during the same period, among them an unarmed woman and two apparent bystanders as well as the perpetrators of attacks. The Palestinian casualties were mostly killed by Israeli security forces in stepped-up army operations in the occupied West Bank. The recent escalation has raised fears of another armed conflict similar to the 11-day war a year ago between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which was in part triggered by unrest at al-Aqsa, a site holy to both Jews and Muslims. Informally, Jews are allowed to visit but not pray at the site. In recent years, however, growing numbers of Jewish visitors, sometimes praying with police escorts, have inflamed longstanding Palestinian fears that Israel plans to annex the area. The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, told his cabinet on Sunday that the country was entering a 'new stage in the war on terror' and said Israel was establishing a civilian national guard that would be deployed in emergency situations like the kinds of attacks the country has witnessed in recent weeks. 'The Israeli government's main goal is to restore personal security to Israeli citizens,' he said. Bennett will also convene his security cabinet this week to discuss Israel's options in responding to the latest incident and incitement from Hamas. All of the recent attacks on Israeli soil appear to have been committed by individuals or small groups acting without coordination from larger organisations. Hamas leaders praised Thursday's events in Elad, but did not claim responsibility. The Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth reported on Sunday that officials were considering restricting the entry of Gazan workers into Israel and mending the hundreds of holes in the West Bank separation barrier that thousands of Palestinians use to access illegal work in Israel. Aware of the economic pressures facing Palestinian society, and benefiting from the cheap labour, Israel had until recently been turning a blind eye to the illegal crossings from the West Bank.", "d1d862b4e9c80300f624bbff1008c7fc420870bb326453f2cb59f387": "Senator Kirsten Gillibrand on Sunday called the battle over abortion rights in the US the 'biggest fight of a generation'. The New York Democrat urged her party to stand up to Republicans seeking to abolish the constitutional right, and called the draft US supreme court opinion leaked last week, revealing a conservative-leaning super-majority supports overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision, 'bone-chilling'. She told CNN's State of the Union Sunday politics talk show: 'This is the biggest fight of a generation ... and if America's women and the men who love them do not fight right now, we will lose the basic right to make decisions, to have bodily autonomy and to decide what our futures look like.' Mississippi Republican governor Tate Reeves praised the draft ruling, which emerged last Monday evening and immediately sparked protests outside the supreme court in Washington DC, with more the next day and huge demonstrations planned across the US. His state has the pivotal case currently before the court that includes the option not just to severely restrict the procedure further but specifically to overturn the Roe v Wade opinion that made abortion a federal right, which was reaffirmed by the supreme court in 1992. 'While this is a great victory for the pro-life movement, it is not the end. In fact, it's just the beginning,' Reeves said of the draft opinion. Mississippi hopes to ban almost all abortion in a state that normally carries out around 3,500 such procedures a year. He talked of providing more education for women, to help them get better jobs to support children. Gillibrand called Reeves 'paternalistic' and his and the court's stance outrageous. 'It's taking away women's right for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, our right to be a full citizen,' she said, adding that women are 'half citizens under this ruling and if this is put into law, it changes the foundation of America'. Reeves said Mississippi plans to improve adoption processes and foster care systems and provide more resources for those expecting. However the state has a poor record on healthcare for low-wealth women, particularly women of color, in a nation frequently called out for high infant mortality rates and poor antenatal health. CNN show host Jake Tapper noted that Mississippi has the highest rate of child mortality in the United States, the highest rate of child poverty, no guaranteed paid maternity leave and that the legislature in Mississippi 'just rejected extending postpartum Medicaid coverage', referring to government health insurance for low-income populations. Tapper also pointed out that Mississippi's foster care system is the subject of a long-running federal lawsuit over its failure to protect children from abuse. Reeves said: 'I was elected not to try to hide our problems but to try to fix our problems.' Gillibrand said she was offended by Reeves's remarks, adding: 'I thought he was quite paternalistic towards women. He doesn't look at women as full citizens.' Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, a fellow New York Democrat, said on Sunday that a piece of legislation that has been stalled in Congress would be put to the vote by the Senate again, on Wednesday. The Women's Health Protection Act, which enshrines the rights afforded by Roe into federal legislation, rather than relying on court decisions, has passed the House of Representatives but was struck down in the senate in March, with one Democrat joining Republicans in opposing it. The final supreme court decision on Roe is due in June.  Overturning Roe and instead letting each state set its own law on abortion would leave entire regions of the country without an abortion clinic within a day's drive, reshaping the geography of abortion access in America in a single seismic shift. Minnesota Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar told ABC's This Week host Martha Raddatz that there were Democrats in Congress and Democratic candidates who do not support abortion rights. But she said: 'You have people who are personally pro-life but believe that that decision should be a woman's personal choice, even if they might not agree with them. We have people in our party who vote to uphold Roe v Wade who might have different personal opinions, that's a really important distinction.' She accused the supreme court, which achieved a right-leaning controlling majority after Donald Trump nominated three justices - now having six conservatives and only three liberal-leaning judges on the nine-member bench, of wanting to take America back into ancient history. The draft opinion was written by conservative justice Samuel Alito. 'The court is looking at reversing 50 years of women's rights, and the fall will be swift. Over 20 states have laws [to ban] in place already. Who should make this decision, should it be a woman and her doctor, or a politician? Should it be [conservative Republican Senator] Ted Cruz...or a woman and her family? Justice Alito is literally not just taking us back to the 1950s, he's taking us back to the 1850s,' Klobuchar said. Pro-abortion rights groups NARAL pro-choice America, Planned Parenthood and Emily's List plan between the three of them to put more than $150m into campaigns to support abortion rights advocates as political candidates in elections this year. Mini Timmaraju, president of NARAL, told ABC: 'As a movement, this has been probably the most devastating year since pre-1973.'", "12fb3ba5346ce251be2ba02739ed89f6a81cf2f71cdde767114674c3": "Picnics have been banned and bins fenced off in a large swathe of northern Rome as health authorities move to contain the wild boar population after African swine fever was detected in a deceased animal. Feeding or approaching the animals has also been forbidden, while people who have walked through farmland or nature reserves in the affected areas have been told to disinfect their shoes. African swine fever, which is fatal to pigs and wild boar but harmless to humans, was detected in the body of a dead boar in the Insugherata nature reserve on Thursday. It was the first time a case had been reported in the centre of Italy after the disease was found in wild boar in the northern Piedmont region in January, prompting the government to appoint a special commissioner to impose measures to eradicate the illness. The affected anti-boar 'red zones' in Rome are located in the north and north-west of the Italian capital, including an area close to Vatican City. About 23,000 wild boar live in and around Rome, according to estimates from Coldiretti, the farmers' association. The animals are often seen in parks, walking down the road or searching for food in overflowing rubbish bins, mostly in districts in the north of the city. Residents in several neighbourhoods last week imposed a nightly 'curfew' after a spate of attacks by wild boar. One woman suffered minor injuries after being pushed to the ground by animal she encountered as she put out the rubbish. The Italian health minister, Roberto Speranza, said the situation would receive 'maximum attention'. Andrea Costa, a health ministry undersecretary, said the government was also discussing a 'slaughtering plan' to reduce the wild boar population. 'I respect the sensitivities of animal rights activists and environmentalists, but we are facing an emergency and it must be addressed with emergency measures,' he told the state broadcaster, Rai.", "dfb9307f0612fc3d1a9bf4112273f38f9bad754762aec2551e10b375": "A Nepali sherpa has scaled Mount Everest for a record 26th time, breaking his own previous record set last year, a government official says. Kami Rita Sherpa, 52, scaled the 8,849-metre mountain on Saturday along the traditional south-east ridge route leading 10 other Sherpa climbers.'Kami Rita has broken his own record and established a new world record in climbing,' Taranath Adhikari, director general of the Department of Tourism in the capital of Kathmandu, said on Sunday.Kami Rita's wife, who gave her name as Jangmu, said she was happy at her husband's achievement. The climbing route used by Kami Rita was pioneered by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Nepali sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and remains the most popular.This year Nepal has issued 316 permits to climb Everest in the peak season, which runs through May, compared with 408 last year, the highest ever. On Sunday Nepali officials said Russian climber Pavel Kostrikin died at Camp I of Mount Everest, the first reported death of a foreigner this climbing season. 'The Russian climber fell sick at Camp II and died after being brought to the Camp I,' Bhishma Kumar Bhattarai, an official of Nepal's Department of Tourism, said. Camp II on the normal southeast ridge route on Everest is located at a height of around 6,400 metres (20,997 feet). Hiking officials said the body of Kostrikin would be brought to Kathmandu when the current cloudy weather conditions improve.The Himalayan nation, which is heavily reliant on climbers for foreign exchange, faced criticism for allowing overcrowding and several climber deaths on the mountains in 2019.Everest has been climbed 10,657 times since it was first scaled in 1953 from Nepali and Tibetan sides.

The latest finds, sculpted in limestone by the Nuragic civilisation, add to several other statues of boxers, wrestlers and archers dug up at the site since the 1970s and which have become known as 'the giants of Mont'e Prama'. The bare torsos, along with their fragments, have been identified as depicting Cavalupo boxers, due to the shield wrapped around their bodies. They are similar to two other statues found a few metres away at the site in Cabras, on the Italian island's west coast, in 2014. The discovery comes after fresh excavations in the southern area of the huge necropolis began in early April. 'It's an exceptional discovery,' said the Italian culture minister, Dario Franceschini, adding that it would shed further light on ancient Mediterranean culture. 'Two new jewels add to the mysterious charm of this group of statues,' he said. Archaeologists have also unearthed a major burial road, along which tombs dating between 950BC to 730BC have been found. The Mont'e Prama site was first discovered by local farmers in 1974. It is believed that the warrior statues, ranging in height between 2 and 2.5 metres, guarded tombs at the necropolis. Studies done so far of 170 tombs found that the cemetery was reserved almost exclusively for young men. The Nuragic civilisation flourished in Sardinia until the second century AD. Thousands of large tower-shaped stone structures, known as nuraghi, have been found across the island, although their original purpose is unknown. Some of the statues found at Mont'e Parma have been on display at Cabras museum since 2014. The new statues will also eventually be exhibited. Monica Stochino, the culture ministry's superintendent for southern Sardinia, said: 'The two large and heavy blocks of torsos will need time to be freed from the sediment surrounding them and to be prepared for safe recovery.'", "7ac1478e927a9df9aab1b581aace72a2ad12cd3a52eb54179eb01783": "About 20m acres of cropland in the United States may be contaminated from PFAS-tainted sewage sludge that has been used as fertilizer, a new report estimates. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 9,000 compounds used to make products heat-, water- or stain-resistant. Known as 'forever chemicals' because they don't naturally break down, they have been linked to cancer, thyroid disruption, liver problems, birth defects, immunosuppression and more. Dozens of industries use PFAS in thousands of consumer products, and often discharge the chemicals into the nation's sewer system. The analysis, conducted by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), is an attempt to understand the scope of cropland contamination stemming from sewage sludge, or biosolids. Regulators don't require sludge to be tested for PFAS or closely track where its spread, and public health advocates warn the practice is poisoning the nation's food supply. 'We don't know the full scope of the contamination problem created by PFAS in sludge, and we may never know, because EPA has not made it a priority for states and local governments to track, test and report on,' said Scott Faber, EWG's legislative policy director. All sewage sludge is thought to contain the dangerous chemicals, and the compounds have recently been found to be contaminating crops, cattle, water and humans on farms where biosolids were spread. Sludge is a byproduct of the wastewater treatment process that's a mix of human excrement and industrial waste, like PFAS, that's discharged from industry's pipes. Sludge disposal can be expensive so the waste management industry is increasingly repackaging it as fertilizer because excrement is rich in plant nutrients. EWG found Ohio keeps the most precise records of any state, and sludge has been applied to 5% of its farmland since 2011. Extrapolating that across the rest of the country would mean about 20m acres are contaminated with at least some level of PFAS. Faber called the estimate 'conservative'. EPA records show over 19bn pounds of sludge has been used as fertilizer since 2016 in the 41 states where the agency tracks the amount of sludge that's spread, but not the location. It's estimated that 60% of the nation's sludge is spread on cropland or other fields annually. The consequences are evident in the only two states to consistently check sludge and farms for PFAS contamination. In Maine, PFAS-tainted fields have already forced several farms to shut down. The chemicals end up in crops and cattle, and the public health toll exacted by contaminated food in Maine is unknown. Meanwhile, the state is investigating about 700 more fields for PFAS pollution. 'There's no easy way to shop around this problem,' Faber said. 'We shouldn't be using PFAS-contaminated sludge to grow food and feed for animals.' Michigan faces a similar situation as it uncovers contaminated beef and farms, and growing evidence links sludge to public health problems and contaminated drinking water. The health cost of using sludge outweighs the benefits, advocates say. Many have questioned the sense in spending billions of dollars to pull sludge out of water only to inject the substance into the nation's food supply, and calls for a ban on the practice are growing louder. 'The EPA could today require treatment plants to test sludge for PFAS and warn farmers that they may be contaminating fields, but it has refused to do so,' Faber said.", "aefde38fa7c351399e7d42e94edf7801f0dc4e026de7001df49cd544": "Scientists are developing magnetically guided microscopic projectiles that can be injected into patients' blood to attack breast, prostate and other tumours.  The project - led by researchers at Sheffield University - builds on progress in two key medical fields. The first involves viruses that specifically attack tumours. The second focuses on soil bacteria that manufacture magnets which they use to align themselves in the Earth's magnetic field. 'The essence of this approach is straightforward: we are using bugs as drugs,' said Dr Munitta Muthana, one of the project's leaders. 'We are taking a class of viruses that naturally target tumours and are developing ways to help them reach internal tumours by exploiting bacteria that make magnets. It's a twin approach and it has a lot of promise, we believe.' The anti-cancer viruses that are being exploited by the Sheffield group - who have been funded by Cancer Research UK - are known as oncolytic viruses. They occur naturally but can also be modified to improve their efficacy and to limit the chances of them infecting healthy cells. After infection with an oncolytic virus, a cancer cell will burst open and die. The US Food and Drug Administration has already approved the use of T-Vec, a modified herpes simplex virus that infects and kills tumour cells and is now being used to treat people with certain types of melanoma, a skin cancer. However, the Sheffield team - whose work has just been awarded the Roger Griffin prize for cancer drug discovery - want to expand the range of tumours that can be tackled this way. In particular, they want to target breast and prostate cancers as priorities. 'The problem is that oncolytic viruses attract the attention of the body's immune defences and only skin-deep tumours can be tackled this way before the viruses are blocked fairly quickly by our cell defences,' said Dr Faith Howard, another project leader. A solution, the scientists say, is to coat the viruses in magnetic particles. Injected into the blood, these microscopic projectiles could then be directed quickly to a tumour - by using magnets placed over a patient's body - before their progress can be blocked by immune defences. 'It's like having a coat of armour or a shield,' added Muthana. 'The magnets help protect the virus but crucially they also help them to target a tumour. We place a magnet over a tumour and it will draw the virus speedily and directly to it.' An oncolytic virus had a diameter of about 180 nanometres while the magnets needed to be about 50 nanometres in size, added Howard. (A nanometre is a billionth of a metre.) 'These tiny magnets could be made in the laboratory but we have found bacteria do a better job of manufacturing them than we could,' she added. Some species of soil bacteria synthesise iron oxide nanoparticles that are called magnetosomes. These are used as compasses that allow the microbes to navigate in Earth's magnetic field and help them find optimum conditions for their growth and survival. 'These microscopic magnets they make are perfectly shaped and ideally suited to the microscopic packages we need to target deep cancers,' Howard said. Having developed the technology, the Sheffield team is now working to ensure they can manufacture sufficient supplies so that clinical trials on humans can begin soon. To date, trials have focused on animal models. 'These early tests have been very encouraging and we now need to take the next steps to bring this technique to a state where it can be administered to humans - hopefully in a few years' time,' she said.", "935ad3bfbff62e0419c222335be9f8927bf2f53091c3e40917495749": "The UN is to stage a rare donor conference on Wednesday in a bid to raise the $80m (PS65m) necessary to prevent an ageing oil tanker off the west coast of Yemen exploding and causing an environmental disaster potentially four times worse than the Exxon Valdez spill near Alaska in 1989. The money is needed to offload more than 1.14m barrels of oil that have been sitting in the decrepit cargo ship, Safer, for more than six years because of an impasse between Houthi groups and the Saudi-backed government over ownership and responsibility. Previous UN mediation efforts over the potentially lethal byproduct of Yemen's civil war have failed, partly because the Houthi rebels that now control the capital, Sana'a, have not been able to agree terms for UN-commissioned engineers to board the ship. The Houthis have regarded the ship and its lucrative cargo as their possession and a bargaining chip in the negotiations with the Saudi- and Emirati-backed forces.  Expert engineers and environmentalists have warned the ship is an unexploded timebomb capable of causing an ecological disaster. UN estimates suggest that if the ship's cargo is unleashed into the Red Sea, more than 200,000 fishermen would lose their jobs and $20bn would be required for a clean-up operation. But under a new agreement, laboriously negotiated over six months by the UN and Dutch diplomats, an international donor conference will aim to raise the required $80m to offload the light crude oil. The plan is the brainchild of the UN resident coordinator and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, who claims it has the support of the Saudi-backed and Houthi-backed governments. A memorandum of understanding was signed by the Houthis on 5 March that allows the UN to transfer about 1.1m barrels of oil from the vessel, which is stranded 8km off Ras Isa port on Yemen's Houthi-held west coast. The oil would be transferred to a secure vessel which would remain in place. A new tanker would be purchased for the Houthis within 18 months to replace Safer, thus providing them with the insurance that they would be able to operate a profitable oil export industry when the civil war ends. The Safer vessel would be towed and sold for scrap. The Houthis would have no legal or commercial liability. Gressly said the crisis was urgent since 'in March, a UN-led mission to the Ras Isa peninsula confirmed that the 45-year-old supertanker is rapidly decaying. It is at imminent risk of spilling a massive amount of oil due to leakages or an explosion'. Inert air on the ship that normally inhibits an explosion has dissipated, the UN said. Doug Weir at the Conflict and Environment Observatory said: 'While some may question the $80m price tag of the UN-mediated plan to address the threat posed by the FSO Safer, the costs of inaction - which start at $20bn for managing the consequences of a catastrophic spill - are far, far greater. The world has watched this situation grow more dangerous with every passing month, and it's vital that donors provide the money that is needed to allow this urgent plan to proceed this summer.' Greenpeace said the UN plan must be implemented before October, 'when the wind and the currents will be too dangerous and hinder any rescue operation. Lack of funding cannot be an excuse to fail.' Constructed in 1976 as an oil tanker and converted a decade later to be a floating storage facility for oil, no structural repairs have been made to the 376-metre-long vessel since Yemen's civil war started in 2015. It contains 36 different oil storage facilities amounting to a capacity of more than 3m barrels. The unavailability of diesel fuel has meant that Safer's engines have not been started for several years, and the structure has been exposed to humidity and corrosion with little or no maintenance. A major spillage would force the closure of the ports of Hodeidah and As Salif - which are essential for commercial imports and the provision of life-saving humanitarian assistance.

Ayman Asfari, the Syrian-born executive who built London-listed Petrofac into a global oil engineering company, will leave the company next year. It will mark an end to a colourful career at the firm, during which Asfari was arrested and interviewed in 2017 when the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) began its investigation. Petrofac agreed to pay PS77m last October after failing to prevent former senior employees from offering or paying bribes to secure contracts in the Middle East between 2012 and 2015. The SFO last month formally confirmed Asfari was no longer a suspect. Asfari spent more than three decades building his empire, amassing the trappings of a billionaire lifestyle with a private jet and a superyacht to cruise on the French riviera. The success of his early career, carved out in the 1980s oil boom, has been overshadowed by the long-running fraud office investigation. He stepped down as chief executive of the oil services company in late 2020 but has remained on the board since. The company has now disclosed in its annual report that he will depart at next summer's annual shareholder meeting. Petrofac was founded in Texas in 1981, before expanding internationally, and Asfari led a management buyout and a float on the London stock market in 2005. The listing netted him PS55m but he has lamented that selling his 10% stake was a mistake, as the value of the company subsequently ballooned. Asfari, 63, was born in Syria but spent his childhood on the move. His father's diplomatic postings took him to Turkey, the US and the former Czechoslovakia. He studied at Wharton business school, whose alumni include Donald Trump and Sundar Pinchai, chief executive of Google's owner, Alphabet. He began his career as a consulting engineer testing soil in Dubai. In the early 1980s, he moved to Muscat in Oman, starting a construction business building roads to drilling locations and camps amid the oil boom. His business entered into a joint-venture with America's Petrofac and Asfari eventually rebooted the business, pursuing growth outside the US from a London office. Asfari has said his upbringing gave him a western view of the world, but he can 'understand the emotions and the romantic approach of the east'. He went on to build a firm with 8,500 employees and more than 30 offices worldwide, designing and maintaining rigs and pipelines for the world's biggest oil and gas companies. Petrofac and its peers were briefly stock market darlings a decade ago before a declining oil price hit shares. The stock has fallen 80% since the SFO opened its investigation. The affair threw a spotlight on two former prime ministers' links to the company. In 2017, David Cameron promoted the company during a two-day stay in Bahrain, flying back from the country on a plane owned by Asfari. Theresa May wrote to her Bahraini counterpart to support Petrofac's bid for a contract in the country during her tenure in Downing Street. Petrofac did not ultimately land the contract. Asfari has, with his wife, given about PS800,000 to the Conservative party. He remains a 17% shareholder and an influential figure at Petrofac. Last year, investors gave the company a bloody nose over his continued involvement - more than 30% of shareholders voted against his re-appointment. The company responded, saying he had provided 'additional support and stability in a year of significant challenge'. Shareholder adviser Glass Lewis says, given his impending retirement, it is happy to recommend investors approve his re-election to the board this month. Petrofac said in the annual report that the SFO investigation had 'cast a shadow' and been a 'painful learning experience', and that former employees had left its teams feeling 'let down'. Four former employees have had their outstanding share awards cancelled. The company's chairman, Rene Medori, was due to step down this month but will now stay on for an extra year. Under the new chief executive, Sami Iskander, it hopes to make a break from the past. For Asfari, a new chapter beckons. Last year, he formed Venterra, a venture aimed at creating a services business for the offshore wind industry. He's also switching sea lanes: Asfari has reportedly put his almost-new 61-metre (201-ft) superyacht up for sale. The Cloud 9, built as an opulent pleasure boat with its own swimming pool and private terrace, is up for sale for a rumoured EUR59m (PS51m).", "895cf29db39ef91c5660dbafa08c24c451e4247bb5eb47b1ab07dd08": "Emmanuel Macron said that his reelection marked a 'fundamental democratic renaissance' as he was sworn in for a second term of office as president of France at a ceremony at the Elysee Palace. Macron, who defeated his far right rival, Marine Le Pen, in the second round vote two weeks ago, entered on Saturday to the strains of Handel played by the Garde Republicaine's string quartet and listened as the official results were read. 'From the return of war to Europe to the pandemic and the ecological emergency, rarely has our country been faced with such a combination of challenges. The French people have chosen a clear and explicit project for the future, a European project of independence, scientific, social and ecological progress,' he told the 500 guests in a relatively brief acceptance speech, 'It's at the most difficult times that France shows the best of itself. At this moment when the century is changing, we have to map out a path and show a way forward together,' he said. 'Let us have the courage to look reality in the face. Let us be faithful to the values of freedom, equality, fraternity and secularism. Let us continue to love the Republic and all that it entails. Let us love our homeland.' He insisted his second five-year term would not be a simple continuation of the first mandate but would be a 'new method'. He pledged 'to act' to create a 'more inclusive' education system, and 'a health service accessible everywhere' as well as greater sexual equality and a stronger military. 'I have one aim and that is to serve, to serve our country ... to serve my compatriots with a sense of duty ... to serve our children and youngsters,' he said. Afterwards he shook hands with many of the guests who included former presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande as well as current members of his cabinet all facing a reshuffle in the coming days. He then walked to the Elysee gardens to honour the Tricolor while the Marseillaise was played followed by a 21-gun salute fired from Les Invalides military complex. Macron, 44, who won the election on 24 April with a score of 58.55% against Le Pen, is now expected to name a new prime minister to replace Jean Castex as well as other ministers. Gabriel Attal, the government spokesperson, told France 2 the government would not change before Macron's second mandate officially begins on 13 May. Saturday's ceremony came after the Parti Socialiste along with the Greens/Ecologists and Communists formed a historic alliance for next month's two-round parliamentary elections under the leadership of the radical left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, of La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), who came a close third in the presidential election. Various centrist and centre-right factions have rallied to Macron under the slogan Ensemble (Together); the president has changed the name of his La Republique en Marche (Republic on the Move) party - formed to sweep him to power five years ago - to Renaissance.

Fed up with customers at the famous Whisky-a-Go-Go club repeatedly playing the same songs on the jukebox, and remarking that the sound of 'couples snogging in the corners' between records killed the atmosphere, she installed two turntables for continuous music. It was the start of a career as a nightclub owner for the woman who would become known simply as Regine and that would see her credited as creating la discotheque. Regine, nicknamed Queen of the Night, has died aged 92. From her first club in Paris's Latin Quarter, Chez Regine, established in 1956, her empire would eventually stretch to more than 20 establishments entertaining the world's beau monde: the rich; the famous; the aristocratic, including royals, from Buenos Aires to Monte Carlo via Kuala Lumpur, Cairo and Los Angeles. Her clientele was eclectic but almost exclusively wealthy, powerful and well connected, among them Andy Warhol, Brigitte Bardot, the Rothschilds, the Kennedys, Liza Minnelli, Truman Capote, Marlene Dietrich, Henry Miller, Richard Nixon, the future president Georges Pompidou, the mobster John Gotti and Salvador Dali. She dyed her hair flame red and attracted diverse lovers: the actors Robert Mitchum, Warren Beatty, Gene Kelly, Steve McQueen and Omar Sharif, and singer Jacques Brel, as well as sporting stars and alpinists Jean-Claude Killy and Maurice Herzog, the Spanish matador El Cordobes and the Swedish tennis champion Bjorn Borg. 'I do love champions,' she told French television. Dancing was her passion: 'If you can't dance, you can't make love,' she would say, and she famously taught the Duke of Windsor to do the twist. The rich and famous went to Regine's, where drinks were sold by the bottle, to see and be seen, but their exclusivity was founded on illusion; a 'Full' sign would be put outside each of her clubs even as they opened, a hype that created the demand that saw everyone, however privileged, queue to enter. 'After a certain hour [of the night], it's sometimes difficult to distinguish a princess from a prostitute. And one doesn't exclude the other,' she wrote in her memoirs. Only London failed to fall for Regine's charms. Her two attempts to open clubs in the city crashed. 'The English have no style,' she claimed afterwards. By the early 80s, Regine also had her own line of perfume, but as times and tastes changed, the clubs closed, and bad investments diminished her fortune. For those who knew her traumatic history, and she made no secret of it, Regine's self-professed workaholism and search for recognition and respect were rooted in trying to compensate for a childhood blighted by an alcoholic father, an absent mother and the Nazis. Regina (she became Regine later) was born in Anderlecht, Belgium, to Tauba Rodstein and Joseph Zylberberg, both Polish Ashkenazi Jews. Her parents had lived for eight years in Argentina and moved to Paris when Joseph, a drinker and gambler, lost the family boulangerie in a poker game. Rodstein soon gave up and returned to Argentina, leaving Regina and her brother, Maurice, in their largely absent father's care. During the Nazi occupation of France, the children went into hiding in a series of foster homes, including a convent in Aix-en-Provence where Regina was beaten by other girls for being Jewish. At the age of 14, she was working at a refuge for the elderly in Lyon where she fell in love with the owners' son, Claude, nephew of Bernard Schonberg, the chief rabbi in the city. In 1944 he was on his way to the synagogue to discuss marrying her when he was arrested by the Nazis and dispatched to the concentration camps, where he died. Shortly afterwards, aged 16, Regina married Leon Rotcajg, with whom she had a son, Lionel, but they divorced four years later. In postwar Paris, Regine worked in the cafe-bar-brasserie in the 20th arrondissement established by her father, where she also learned to cook. After opening Chez Regine, in France she also became well known as a singer and occasional actor, starring in films by the directors Claude Lelouch and Claude Zidi and recording a number of albums. Having sold all her nightclubs by the late 2000s, Regine declared herself 'ruined'. However, she went on to harness her connections for charitable causes, including the fight against drug abuse, wrote three volumes of a memoir and returned to singing. In 2015, she set off for her first concert tour, performing just some of the 300 songs she claimed had been written for her during her lifetime. 'For a long time, songs were just a hobby. But now I realise that the stage has been the most important part of my life,' she said. Asked by a French journalist why she had not retained her family name, and went by Regine, she responded: 'Can you imagine someone saying 'tonight, we'll meet at the Regina Zylberberg...'? By the time you say it, the night is already over.' In a profile published in New York magazine in 1977, Regine said her penchant for throwing spectacular events was to make up for all the birthday parties she never had. 'One by one, I have filled the dreams of my childhood,' she told the magazine. She married Roger Choukroun, a computer engineer, in 1969 and divorced him in 2004, but despite her marriages and many lovers, Regine would always describe Claude Schonberg as her 'first and only true love'. Her son, Lionel, died in 2006. She is survived by a granddaughter, Daphne.", "47fe6f624f71705e58c0b59734ca714c35321c2f2f226c05bfffd528": "", "134cb3f6f6c1e132b3a3b0ca53c7e941bb25b1378025f579eb67324b": "", "c07136d7b03acf854f6ed9ce954630be8de7823a99968d2375dc054f": "", "dfcaced8958ff0442fc0f61fff1b47c8c22486aebb405ba15de8da6f": "", "b61bcb40292c0a068b827747194f92a500cfbd52ec82417ed93f80ee": "", "3714e8b8822d826d52907b330049d76531087f14496d1f8f966b7fc3": "In a slightly creaky, book-filled office at Cardiff University, Matthew Williams pulls up a blood-red graph on his computer. At first glance you might think it referred to stock market fortunes, but when I peer closely, the sad truth behind its jagged peaks becomes clear: it traces the amount of anti-Black hate speech recorded on Twitter in the aftermath of last July's Euro 2020 final, when England lost to Italy in a nail-biting penalty shootout. After missed penalties from three Black England players, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka, racist abuse 'went through the roof', says Williams. Within the hour there was an almost 700% increase in hate directed against those players. Half of the 20,000 toxic tweets came from within the UK; the police made 11 arrests for hate crimes, four of which have resulted in prosecutions. In some ways this is a textbook example of a hate-filled outburst. There was a trigger event and, for many offenders, lots of alcohol and drugs involved. That the abuse trickled off over the following two days is also typical. But the content of the hate directed against the players was new. Alongside familiar racists slurs there was a deluge of primate emojis. Williams calls this a key shift. 'We've never seen emojis used as features of hate speech in that way - and volume - before.' Williams would know: he is a professor of criminology specialising in hate crimes and, along with computer scientist Pete Burnap, is the co-founder of the HateLab, a platform that monitors hate across social media in real time. They are on the frontline of internet hate, observing shifts in behaviour and figuring out who is stirring the fury. They pass their insights on to civil rights organisations, governments and big tech firms who use it to inform counter-hate-speech campaigns, ban users and pursue prosecutions. An all-seeing eye for the racist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic venom that humans spit at one another from behind keyboards, Williams has advised everyone from Twitter, Meta (formerly Facebook), Google and TikTok to the Professional Footballers Association, the UK Home Office and the US Department of Justice. The 45-year-old has also just published a book that investigates the biological and sociological reasons why people commit hate crimes. The Science of Hate asks big, urgent questions: is everyone capable of hate? Is this the most hateful the world has ever been? And, perhaps most importantly, how can we combat it? In recent years, hate has felt omnipresent. 'It is no coincidence that soaring hate-crime figures are found in countries where the extreme right is rising,' writes Williams, adding that 'divisive messages from public figures are directly linked to tipping some people into violence on the streets.' The 2016 election of Donald Trump coincided with the biggest rise in hate crimes in the US since 9/11. And the HateLab found there were 1,100 racist attacks committed in the UK as a direct result of the 2016 Brexit referendum result. In nations with reasonable hate-crime recording standards, such as the UK, US and much of Europe, the data points to an 'upward trend,' says Williams. The internet has amplified the rage by giving people a 24/7 hotline to spurt poisonous views and egg one another on. A 2021 survey found that half of all 12- to 15-year-olds in the UK had encountered hateful content online. 'Left unchallenged,' he writes, 'the expression of hate... has the potential to become more widespread than at any other point in history.' Yet Williams is no doomster. With neatly combed hair, a gently lilting Welsh accent and an easy laugh, he is a surprisingly cheery character given his line of work. He does, however, want to awaken us to the fact that 'everyone' has prejudices - 'You can say you don't but you're lying' - and, under the right mix of circumstances, has the potential to slide towards hateful behaviour. It's a sobering thought in a woke era in which we're loath to admit any prejudices. But it's intended as a rallying cry. Being mindful of our own prejudices helps us keep them in check - and understanding how biases work better equips us to de-fang those who peddle hate, especially online. 'To keep my faith in humanity I have to constantly remind myself that the majority are not hateful,' says Williams. 'What I hope for is for more of these good citizens to stand up to hatred when they see it, instead of scrolling or walking on.' Williams, who is gay, knows full well how damaging a hate crime can be. In 1998, when he was 20, he was beaten up by three men after leaving a gay bar in London. Their punches were punctuated by snickering and homophobic slurs. The attack shook him. 'I couldn't get it out of my head: it filled my thoughts until there was no room for anything else,' he says. Even today, he won't hold his husband's hand in public for fear of being targeted. 'It's stayed with me for a long, long time.' It also shaped his career, prompting the then-aspiring journalist to switch to criminology. A key thrust behind the book was to find out what made his attackers do what they did that day. 'There's this notion that all hate crime offenders are monsters beyond understanding and that if you dare to try to understand them, you humanise them or in some way provide an excuse for their behaviour,' he says. 'I wanted to find something that really separated me from my attackers, something that was unique about them - and different from me.' Instead, his findings showed that he and his attackers were, in all likelihood, 'remarkably similar in our biology and psychology'. The common core? An innate human desire to be part of a group and to favour people we perceive to be like us. Such 'groupishness' is an evolutionary trait: huddling with others increases our chance of survival. And it means that, from a young age, we instinctively view the world through the lens of our group and other folks: 'us' and 'them'. Our behaviour towards 'others' occupies a spectrum, with unconscious bias at one end, prejudice in the middle and hate at the other extreme. Whereas prejudiced behaviour means avoiding others, hateful acts seek them out in order to hurt them. There's often a twisted moral element to hate, too, with offenders claiming that the victim's group are an affront to their way of life. Neuroscientific studies suggest bias is mapped on to our brains: the amygdala, a 'fast but dumb' threat detector in our temporal lobe, as Williams puts it, often sounds an alarm when it registers someone who is not like us. The smarter prefrontal cortex then overrules it when it realises there is nothing to worry about (most studies on this relate to race). But research suggests certain individuals can develop an oversized amygdala and a weak executive control centre, meaning they instinctively overreact to threats and then have no reasoning function to calm things down. Statistically, hate offenders are most likely to be young men (and in western countries, white). Williams imagines them to be 'fearful, angry and powerless'. Traumatic childhoods often set them apart. Many grew up with abusive or absent parents and experienced personal losses, homelessness, drug addictions or other traumas that left them emotionally unstable. 'Childhood scars can thwart psychological development to a point where normal coping mechanisms are either malfunctioning or absent,' he writes. Williams cites a study from the University of Manchester involving in-depth interviews with 15 young white British men convicted of racial violence. When stressed or triggered, they took out their frustrations on ethnic minorities who they 'saw as having less power than them', he writes. 'Race hate provided a convenient home... for their unresolved frustrations from past trauma.' The racial 'other' was an easy target: hate almost always involves punching down. (For the most extreme type of hate criminal, a 'mission offender', eliminating other groups is seen as serving a higher purpose. Examples include suicide bombers; the 1999 London nailbomber who targeted gay, black and Bengali communities; and Joseph Paul Franklin, a KKK member who, during the 1970s and 80s, killed more than 20 black people.) While it's human nature to classify 'us' and 'them', how those lines are drawn is - at least theoretically - not fixed. 'Evolution tells us that we're not inherently racist or biased against a religion or a sexual orientation,' says Williams. That certain groups are consistently targeted for hate is a product of social forces: it is shaped by what we see in the media, what our parents tell us and who we interact with growing up (children who attend mixed-race schools before the age of 12 are less likely to possess race-related bias). And new battle lines are constantly being drawn. Covid has pitted vaxxers and anti-vaxxers against one another, seen a spike in anti-Asian hate crimes and resulted in experts and even the NHS becoming targets of derision. The unique dynamics of social media can spur people into hateful outbursts. Filter bubbles and algorithms reinforce and deepen prejudices, while anonymous accounts reduce accountability. When sparked by an event - whether political vote, terror attack or football game - some users temporarily lose their ability to suppress their ingrained biases and take to their keyboards as the mask of civility slips. In what's known as a 'cascade' effect, they're encouraged by the rush of others doing the same, and the perception that 'such actions have little or no consequence', says Williams, who is currently busy monitoring a prolonged wave of hate speech against Russians in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. The most common target for online hate? Women. 'Misogyny is always the most prevalent category on social media: it's a huge problem,' says Williams. Its rifeness is partly attributable to the fact that women account for half the population (most other hate victims are minorities), so there are lots of targets, and to a culture of misogyny that festers among 'incels' and other all-male communities. Misogyny would probably attract the highest number of hate-crime prosecutions - if it were, in fact, a hate crime. In the UK's hate crime legislation, sex and gender are not recognised as protected characteristics, so a judge is not compelled to consider misogyny as an aggravating factor in sentencing and police are not required to record it as a hate statistic. Just this February, MPs rejected a proposal to add it as a category due to concerns it could complicate domestic violence and rape prosecutions. 'Because there's no sort of legal framework there, [anti-women online hate] is probably not policed to any great extent - not in the same way anti-black or anti- Muslim or anti-gay rhetoric would be,' says Williams. Who should be accountable for stamping out hate is a thorny issue. While governments and police should be responsible for dealing with the most serious offences, in many places - including the US but not the UK - hate crimes are woefully under-reported. This is a combination, says Williams, of a lack of police resources (investigating hate crimes requires considerable effort) and lack of trust in police by the most vulnerable members of society. Online, big tech clearly has a role to play in monitoring content on their sites and banning users who go too far. But sifting through the millions of posts requires vast resources and, as Williams puts it, 'There's no money in stopping hate.' There's no thriving marketplace for services that track hate speech and coordinate anti-hate campaigns, meaning organisations doing these things are chronically underfunded and rely on support from government and charities to survive (HateLab is mostly funded by the UK's Economic and Social Research Council and the Alfred Landecker Foundation). By contrast, 'There seems to be more profit in generating hate and keeping people on social media by engaging with it,' says Williams. As is shown by YouTube's famously addictive algorithm, which draws viewers deeper down a rabbit hole by suggesting ever more extreme content, 'hate is sticky'. It's like not being able to avert your eyes from a car crash. Even so, Williams is optimistic that an anti-hate crusade could bear fruit for businesses concerned with bottom lines. 'Can you imagine if you could say your platform was free of hate speech?' he says. 'How great would that be for the company - but also the profits!' Rather than relying on the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Williams thinks we're best placed to take on the responsibility ourselves. First, we need to learn the art of neutralising hate speech. Our instinct, says Williams, is 'to go in all guns blazing and attack the hate speaker with equally offensive speech sometimes', which - surprise, surprise - escalates the situation. By contrast, calmly challenging the logic of their claims has proven success. 'If they say, 'All Muslims are terrorists,' you say, 'Hang on a second. Don't you think that if every Muslim was a terrorist, we'd have a lot more terror attacks right now? Because there's X many Muslims living in this place.'' The quick-witted among us will be pleased to hear that humour and parody can be handy, too. 'Engaging in a lighthearted way and maybe being a bit sarcastic to highlight the inconsistency of their argument can help - the [hate makers] start to interact a bit more,' he says. And coordinated efforts whereby a group of users are 'singing from the same hymn sheet' are far more effective than solo missions (a catchy hashtag can help engender a sense of solidarity). Such things need to be taught in schools, he says. 'We don't have any solid educational guidance on what the best counter speech is.' Combining this knowledge with an eagle eye, we need to start shutting down bile whenever we see it and taking control of our online spaces. Williams has seen examples of this done with success in the past, such as the 'safety pin' campaign in the aftermath of Brexit, whereby 'every time someone said something racist, a bunch of people would descend on it using the safety-pin hashtag and standing up for migrants.' Williams views Wikipedia as an unlikely North Star. 'It's a self-regulating system: people pull up information if it's false, members of the community flag it and get rid of it. They set their standards of operation.' He's hopeful that we can turn our online spaces into 'more mature' places if counter speakers engage with hate speakers in a sustained, coordinated drive. And en masse. 'That, I think, will change how these platforms look.' It's not rocket science, but it does require a conscious effort. Start by looking at your own prejudices. Then, armed with a calm mind and perhaps a quip or two, pull up your Twitter, Instagram and TikTok feed. And then, you anti-hate hounds, get sniffing.

Every day, hundreds of people arrive at gaps in this stretch of border wall to request political asylum from uniformed federal border agents who stand waiting under a rudimentary metal shade structure in the Sonoran desert heat. Most of those arriving to seek asylum are from Cuba, Venezuela, Colombia, Romania, or other eastern European countries. Official ports of entry dotted along the almost 2,000-mile-long border stretching from the California coast to the Gulf coast of south Texas remain closed to asylum seekers under the government's enduring title 42 public health statute established by Donald Trump's administration at the beginning of thepandemic. So instead migrants arrive at ad-hoc places like these gaps in the wall, alongside the dried-up bed of the Colorado River, to exercise their right to request asylum. In some circumstances, including dangerous conditions in their country of origin, and the distance and difficulty in returning the people there, asylum seekers are exempted from the summary expulsion under title 42 that has upended so many desperate journeys. But to get to the next step in the asylum process, agents in Yuma, according to Customs and Border Protection, require they leave everything behind, except for what they can fit into a small plastic Department of Homeland Security-issued bag. Border residents in Arizona and Texas have observed an increasing number of personal belongings left along the US side of the border wall in the last two years. Usually people leave clothing and sundries, but items such as passports, birth certificates, police reports, and other confidential documents that could be crucial in proving asylum cases have been found abandoned, too. On one trip to the dumpster, Quiroz, director of the AZ-CA Humanitarian Coalition migrant assistance group, came across a navy blue Haitian passport and Cuban passports just lying in the dirt, and he said he can't begin to fathom why. 'Our ports of entries were set up for individuals coming from other countries, and that is where they should be going,' he said, to take part in an orderly and fair legal process. 'But they're not allowed to do that. So, they come here,' he added, indicating the harsh desert and intimidating barrier with its tall metal stakes. He has found rosaries, diaper bags, purses, airline ticket stubs and used face masks. Now the phenomenon is cropping up as a popular backdrop for rightwingers keen on inflammatory immigration talk, and with Texas Republican governor Greg Abbott, under pressure to declare 'an invasion' - especially with the midterm elections looming. Some senior US Border Patrol figures are chiming in. Brandon Judd, union president of the National Border Patrol Council, promoted a white supremacist theory on Fox News last month, claiming that Democrats were going to lift title 42 'to change the demographics of the electorate'. And USBP noted it was Earth Day on 22 April by posting pictures on Instagram of asylum seekers' belongings with the message that it was 'trash and litter left behind by illegal immigration'. In Texas, Brian Hastings, border patrol chief for the Rio Grande Valley sector - another busy corridor for migrant arrival - last summer tweeted 'It's piling up' and labeled images of people's property 'burdensome trash'. But Quiroz said: 'It's not that they're [asylum seekers] leaving a mess. When Border Patrol shows up, they tell them to drop everything and get in line.' Some coalition volunteers began cleaning up the Yuma stretch of border. The county placed two large dumpsters nearby. They also persuaded border patrol to provide shade structures and water for arriving asylum seekers. But he claimed: 'Some politicians are disappointed because we cleaned it up. It's not the visual they want to see for the narrative they want to tell.' In some parts of Texas, so many belongings are left behind that border patrol use heavy machinery to 'shove it off into piles at the side of the road', said Scott Nicol, an environmental activist and artist based in McAllen, near the easternmost point of the US-Mexico border. He has also found personal and confidential documents on his walks along the border. 'What really got to me were the X-rays I found. They were for a six-year-old boy and showed a steel rod in his spine. It was obviously for an asylum claim. Why would anyone part with those?' he said. He said he has even found birth certificates 'torn into a hundred pieces and thrown into the brush'. The Guardian sent images of passports, birth certificates and other documents found at the border wall to Customs and Border Protection, the federal agency overseeing border agents, and requested comment on whether agents were telling asylum seekers to leave their documents behind, and in some cases ripping them up. CBP declined to respond to the questions. In an email, a CBP spokesperson replied that they 'could not speculate on the motivation of an individual discarding copies of personal vital statistic documentation'. When asked about the personal items left behind, CBP wrote in an email that border patrol has a 'policy prohibiting certain items deemed a health hazard, that includes wet or moldy clothes, from entering CBP facilities.' The spokesperson added: 'Items not deemed contraband, or a health hazard are stored and returned to the migrant upon release or will accompany them if transferred to the custody of another agency.' But increasingly people arrive at migrant shelters in the US with only the clothes on their backs, and without any identification. Joanna Williams, executive director of the Kino Border Initiative, a binational migrant advocacy organization that runs a shelter in Nogales, on the Mexican side of the border south of Tucson, Arizona, said one theory she's heard is that smugglers advise migrants to dump their identifying documents when they cross. But in the thousands of intake interviews with migrants the organization has done, Williams said, they've never once heard from someone who had left their documents behind because a smuggler told them to do so. 'The families that we see, who carry things related to their asylum cases, are very clear on the fact that these are important documents, and very concerned about them, if they get misplaced,' she said. However, after the Trump administration began its Remain in Mexico policy for many crossing the border unauthorized, some migrants told them agents ripped up their Mexican immigration visas and other documents. 'The agents would say that they were fake documents when they were actually real, and they really needed them,' she said. Blake Gentry, director of the indigenous language office at Casa Alitas, a migrant shelter in Tucson, estimated that about a third of people arrive at the shelter without documents or belongings. He suspects some agents are forcing migrants to dump their possessions in some sort of rogue practice. 'If this is happening on the US side of the wall, it's most likely Border Patrol,' he said.", "748c5d8def4c4a2b779c4c89f9d0c746cb736c63bb2e30032ae0bcfa": "The most expensive property on the Monopoly board is Mayfair, which also happens to be the most exclusive expanse of real estate in real-life London. Flush with private equity firms, eye-wateringly expensive restaurants and luxury car showrooms, it voted Labour in last week's local elections and helped swing Westminster council away from the Tories for the first time since the Beatles were in the charts with Can't Buy Me Love. Recent years have seen working-class strongholds in the north of England turning Tory, and now you have the even odder spectacle of the super-rich in London voting Labour. That says something about Labour's success in the capital but it also suggests that there is a growing divide between London and the rest of the country, where the party's performance was decidedly less impressive. Of course, most of London is not super-rich. Indeed, there are many deep pockets of poverty in the capital, but they tend to be multi-ethnic and multicultural, and they too vote Labour. Nevertheless, the overall story of London in the past 40 years is one of economic growth that has propelled the capital away from the day-to-day experience of large parts of the nation. Caroline Knowles, a professor of sociology at Goldsmiths University, has written a book on plutocratic London called Serious Money. 'There is undoubtedly a concentration of wealth in London,' she says. 'A while back some of my colleagues made a diagram we called the Fat Bottom Diagram. It depicts wealth in the UK, and the south-east has this huge bulge.' In a crude sense, the political map of the UK has traditionally followed the distribution of wealth, with Labour doing well in poor areas, and Conservatives laying claim to richer constituencies. There have always been exceptions to the rule, but London as a whole now seems intent on demonstrating its exceptionalism. In the past, Labour's wealthier supporters derived largely from the progressive middle-classes, that urban tribe that runs from social work through teaching to the creative industries and the law. The cliche of the metropolitan liberal elite is rooted in north London neighbourhoods like Hampstead and Islington, the natural habitat of the bien pensant professional. Although they are only a few miles away, they are a world apart from the suburban redoubt of Barnet, a Conservative stronghold that Labour had never won before Thursday. Equally, Wandsworth council had been staunchly Conservative since before Margaret Thatcher came to power. The Tories claimed a surprise victory in Harrow. Psephologists will be busy explaining these apparent anomalies, but whatever the local causes they form part of a global story. As the cultural commentator and co-author of The War Against the BBC, Peter York says: 'People in large significant cities are more likely to vote liberal-left, and people in smaller towns or rural communities are more likely to vote conservative. That's a rule right across America and Europe, and London is particularly subject to it because it is a supercity, a world city, the only world city in this country and really the only world city in Europe.' The question is whether the gravitational force of London's size and prominence distorts the rest of country, putting its nose figuratively out of joint, or instead sets a path for it to follow. Is it a benign liberal influence or a self-obsessed bubble that antagonises everywhere else that isn't London? York suspects that it's a mixture of push and pull, but he believes that London is 'completely out of whack with the rest of the country'. If that is an unhealthy position for a capital at the best of times, it's even more troubling when there is a post-Brexit culture and identity war raging. The image that London is able to project, or has projected upon it, is itself a battlefront in the argument between populists and progressives. Take, for example, the collapse of what we might call the 'Mayfair blue wall'. What does that signify? And how is it viewed outside the metropolis? The idea of hedge fund managers voting Labour - and York doubts that they did in any numbers - could well trigger provincial suspicions about the extent to which the party represents ordinary working people. Alternatively, it will give Conservatives pause for thought that a sector of society that has most benefited from Conservative rule - super-rich cosmopolitans - appears to have registered a protest against Boris Johnson's party. 'I think that the really wealthy don't like this particular brand of conservativism practised by the Conservative government,' says Knowles. 'It's narrow, misogynistic, nationalistic and inward-looking. And it's anti-Europe.' Although it's not unique to London, Brexit and its aftermath continue to reverberate in the capital. There is a kind of cultural hangover rather than any meaningful political resistance, a deep-lying frustration at how Middle England has turned its back on Europe, leaving London cut off from the continent over which it increasingly viewed itself as the unofficial capital. Monique Roffey, the Trinidadian-born novelist who won the Costa book of the year award last year for The Mermaid of Black Conch, says most of the young Londoners she meets remain angry at the older generation, in particular the older generation from outside London. 'They've de-Europeanised them,' she says, and the resentment at that altered status has not gone away. It's hard to imagine that these are the issues being urgently aired in the cafes of South Audley Street, but it may be that Mayfair is less different to the rest of London than London is to the rest of the country, at least in terms of cultural identity. 'The fact is London isn't like anywhere else in the country,' says Knowles. 'It's like central Paris or Manhattan. They're sort of islands that have more to do with each other than they have with the rest of their national hinterlands.' She believes that it has been a grave political mistake to allow this divide to grow. 'The whole idea of levelling up, which doesn't really work at all, has been a kind of grudging acknowledgment of that,' she says. London has long dwarfed other British cities, more so than any other European capital in relation to its provinces. Its disproportionate size has created a distinct political and cultural microclimate that has been intensified by the prevailing winds of globalism. London is not just a major city but a global one containing communities with origins in all corners of the planet. Today 40% of Londoners identify as non-white. The city's once renowned regional accent or dialect, Cockney has all but disappeared, to be replaced by a hybrid sociolect known as multicultural London English. It's as if a commitment to diversity and inclusivity has become encoded in the very language of the street. 'It's definitely more multicultural and tolerant,' says Roffey. 'That's why I've felt at home here as someone who's bi-cultural. You can blend in. London is somewhere that's dealt with and coped with immigration, absorption, riots, and more riots.' London, yes, but Barnet? It's hardly the frontline. Say the name to most Londoners and it will conjure visions of a leafy comfort zone safely removed from the turmoil of the inner city melting pot. The reality is rather more complex. For a start, black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups make up 48% of the population. These are communities - aspiring middle-class immigrants and their descendants - to which the Tories have successfully laid claim in the past by emphasising their commitment to entrepreneurialism and laissez faire community politics. When he was mayor of London, Johnson had the political knack of appealing to many different ethnic groups, playing up his cosmopolitan credentials, but his government's mood music has taken a discordant turn towards a more defensive and less open notion of Britain. That Labour can make inroads in places like Barnet suggests that the culture war which Johnson has been happy to tactically stoke has blown back in his face, at least in London. However, given the rocketing cost of living and the general sense of doom about events in the country, that may have paid dividends in limiting Conservative losses elsewhere. The problem is that there are two different national conversations going on - one within London and a few other urban centres and the other everywhere else - that never seem to interact. This kind of silo existence is familiar on social media, which encourages tribal thinking, but it's also becoming a more firmly established geographical phenomenon. For York, so many of the exchanges that take place as part of this cultural skirmish are based on a false narrative. 'When the Daily Mail bangs on about the imputed London-centric liberal elitism of the BBC, the fact is the BBC has 50% of its workforce outside London. Ask yourself, how much of the workforce of the Daily Mail is based outside London?' In any case, he argues, this tension between capital and provinces is an old story. 'Someone said that all those novels and plays of the 1950s really boil down to people getting on a train at a provincial railways station and going to London,' he says. 'It's a cultural, aspirational history of Britain. It oughtn't to be but that's how it is.' Perhaps, but in political terms it's the party that can ensure that it's not a one-way journey that will prevail. Just as Labour has to work out how to speak to its urban supporters and its traditional constituency in a language that makes sense to both, so too do the Tories. It's all very well bad-mouthing the metropolitan liberal elite or the inward-looking provinces but that's not a recipe for winning round those communities. Although economic levelling up is the obvious long-term answer, that seems to be a commitment that is stalled in the rhetorical phase, forever postponed by the worsening economic forecast. In the meantime, London and Not-London have to make the effort to understand each other, appreciate their respective strengths and weaknesses, and stop thinking of the other as the root of the nation's problems.", "88bab137184d08053540f891cf0a9a3d7502549d6cea12a798b6d24e": "", "f633d4eb5bfdc5c4e717abe7d635a2b79c581a78da9fa319fd05c1b5": "After a supreme court decision that overturns Roe v Wade was leaked and signaled the impending end of federal constitutional protection for abortions, a trickle of companies have slowly started to announce policies that provide abortion access for their employees. But while the protections may keep employees and consumers happy, the threat of retaliation from conservative lawmakers looms. Citigroup, one of the biggest banks in the US, quietly started covering the travel expenses of employees who want to get an abortion but are banned from getting one in their home state. The benefit was not announced publicly. Instead, the company mentioned the change in benefits in a March filing for shareholders. Once news outlets began to report on the new benefit, the Republican ire began. Conservatives in Congress asked House and Senate administrators to cancel its contract with the company, which issues credit cards to lawmakers to use for work-related flights, office supplies and other goods. A state lawmaker in Texas, infuriated by Citigroup, introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in Texas if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. 'Citigroup decided to pander to the woke ideologues in its C-suite instead of obeying the laws of Texas,' said Briscoe Cain, the Texas state representative who introduced the bill, in a statement. 'We will enact laws necessary to prevent this misuse of shareholder money and hold Citigroup accountable for its violation of our state's abortion laws'. Citigroup has now been joined by Amazon, Apple, Yelp, Match Group, Tesla and Levi Strauss & Company, all which have said they will offer travel assistance to employees who are in states that restrict abortions. Insiders at JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have told news outlets they too are considering similar policies. 'I expect there will be a significant shift and the most leading companies are going to recognize that they need to protect the healthcare of their employees,' said Shelley Alpern, director of shareholder advocacy at Rhia Ventures. 'Most companies would like to avoid taking a public stance on this issue because it's so controversial, but there are higher risks for companies when they don't protect their employees' healthcare access.' In today's heated political climate - and with midterm elections looming - corporate America can expect a fiery response to any stance it takes on Roe's fall. But given the widespread impact the end of Roe v Wade will have on much of the country - 26 states will restrict abortion access if the decision is overturned - it is unlikely that companies can get away with not responding to the issue once the supreme court makes its final decision. Neeru Paharia, an associate professor at Georgetown University McDonough School of Business, said that people expect more out of companies as trust in government has fallen. 'People are enacting their political will in the marketplace,' she said. For consumers, a purchase from a company can be a symbolic sign of support. For employees, their identities can be tied to the ethical positions of the company they work for. Over the last few years, corporate America has started to become more vocal on various issues that have gotten the attention of conservative lawmakers, including voting rights and LGBTQ+ issues. But conservative politicians have gotten bolder at fighting back against what they consider to be 'woke capitalism'. While the GOP has historically positioned itself as the business-friendly, tax-cutting political party, conservative lawmakers have been emboldened to threaten and punish companies who speak out on controversial issues. Last month, Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, revoked special land use privileges the state gave to Disney for its Disney World theme park in Orlando after the company - responding to backlash from employees and consumers - spoke out against the state's 'don't say gay' law. The move appeared to catch people by surprise. Lloyd Blankfein, former Goldman Sachs CEO, tweeted that the move 'smacks of government retaliation for exercising free speech. Bad look for a conservative.' 'That was really shocking,' Paharia said. 'Now you have a situation where consumers and employees want companies to take a political stance, but then you have governments that are possibly retaliating against them.' When it comes to abortion, 'even though it might not be [explicitly] taking a side ... [companies] are taking a position based on the kind of benefits they are going to offer their employees'. The threats lawmakers have made have so far not come to fruition, but the party seems serious on trying to penalize companies in some way. The Republican senator Marco Rubio introduced a bill this week that would not allow companies to deduct abortion-related travel benefits as regular employee benefits when a company files its taxes. 'Our tax code should be pro-family and promote a culture of life,' he said in a statement. With these warnings, companies may try to keep the introduction of abortion-related quiet or downplay their significance. When Citigroup's CEO, Jane Fraser - the first woman to lead a major American bank - was asked in a shareholders meeting about the company's new abortion travel benefit, she said the benefit 'isn't intended to be a statement about a very sensitive issue'. 'What we did here was follow our past practices,' she said, adding that the company had 'covered reproductive healthcare benefits for over 20 years. And our practice has also been to make sure our employees have the same health coverage, no matter where in the US they live.' Jen Stark, senior director of corporate strategy at Tara Health Foundation, who helped coordinate the signatures of over 180 executives in a statement against abortion bans in 2019, said the potential backlash from conservative lawmakers proves that companies need to act on abortion restrictions beyond mitigating effects for their employees. 'They can buy all the plane tickets their workers need, and that addresses the immediate harm, but the structural deficiency is the collateral damage,' she said. 'The supreme court case didn't happen in a bubble ... you're kind of walking over the rubble.' Beyond benefits for employees, Stark has been advocating for companies to use their lobbying powers and scrutinize political donations as state lawmakers prepare to restrict abortions. 'We are at the moment everyone's cried wolf about. It's here, but there was also a lot of headwind,' she said. 'What companies can do with a stroke of a pen to mitigate some of the harm is important, but the larger issue is getting out of this structural whirlpool that we're in.'", "6b8afcc3179d52c3899f7bd226cd881fbe7eef73b1bf5aede59c3af6": "Ujarneq Egede's farm sits among a cluster of compact houses and squat barns on the snowy slopes of Equaluit Ilua in southern Greenland. The journey from Narsaq, the nearest town, involves a 30 minute boat trip across the fjord, mooring on a sheet of ice and a snowmobile ride up to the farm. This is the biggest island in the world, yet Greenland's population is tiny - less than 57,000 of whom nearly 90% are Inuit, concentrated around the jagged coastline. The country's remoteness is extreme: there are no roads or railways between towns and settlements. Transport is only by boat, helicopter and propeller planes - ice, winds and storms permitting. Narsaq itself is a small town of about 1,300 people, where jobs revolve around fishing, farming, a slaughterhouse and summer tourism. Its population has fallen 25% since 1991. Meanwhile, on his farm, Egede grows potatoes and raises 750 sheep, huddled in barns during the winter and ranging across the grassy mountains throughout summer. To be a farmer in Greenland is to have a front row seat to the climate crisis. Egede tracks the changes - 'summer is sometimes really dry, other times there is too much rain. This winter was really late'. Where once they could drive on the frozen fjord during winter, now that never happens, he says. It is not just climate that worries him, however. Egede's farm is in the shadow of Kvanefjeld, a proposed open-pit uranium and rare earth elements mine. Fearing what it may do to the surrounding environment and his farm, he was immensely relieved when plans for the mine were recently halted after the new government, elected in April 2021, banned uranium mining. But the threat still simmers. Egede is not sure it isover. This southern slice of Greenland, where the main sources of employment include farming, fishing and tourism, has found itself at the sharp end of a quandary the country is reckoning with: how to develop the economy without doing so at the expense of its environment and its people, who rely on the pristine Arctic landscape for their livelihoods. In its own, Greenland way, it is a microcosm of the dilemma facing huge parts of the world. Melting ice sheets and fast-warming temperatures make Greenland a totem for the climate crisis. But as the ice melts, ironically enough, opportunities arise: not only are raw materials easier to access but Greenland is becoming more accessible and tourist seasons are extending. The relatively young government came to power in April 2021 promising pro-environmental policies: it has pledged to join the Paris climate agreement and has banned new licences for oil and gas drilling. But Greenland's abundant minerals have attracted the attention of countries that are currently dependent on China and Russia for the raw materials needed to build the batteries and wind turbines of the low-carbon economy. Mining may mean Greenland could move away from its financial dependence on Denmark, which gives it a grant of 3.9bn Danish krone (PS440m) every year, and towards eventual independence. In Narsaq, the Australian-based Greenland Minerals pitched the Kvanefjeld mine as a source of local opportunity. The pitch failed to impress many, including farmers such as Egede, and Naasu Lund, who lives with her husband and two children on a sheep farm in Inneruulalik, near Narsaq. Lund was part of the anti-mine group Urani? Naamik (Uranium? No). Farmers thought they would be forced to move from farms that had been in their families for generations, says Lund, who also runs horse riding tours from her hydropowered farm. The biggest concern was the tailings pond holding the mining waste, she says, which would remain there for ever. People feared it could spill in Greenland's fierce weather, reaching the fjord in minutes. Urani? Naamik protested - at public consultations, through local campaigning and finally through votes. And it worked. 'This is the first time I can sit in my home and think about a future that is not involved with mining,' Lund says. Whether the mine is over is uncertain, however. Greenland Minerals has launched arbitration proceedings to 'clarify the company's position and to protect our shareholders' considerable investment in Kvanefjeld', according to a spokesperson, who added that a detailed environmental impact assessment had addressed all concerns about the mine. 'Even under the most extreme assumptions there would not be any exceedance of WHO drinking water standards resulting from dispersal of tailings material during foehn winds [strong gusty winds].' While Greenland's government may be saying no to uranium, it is open to other mining and the warming climate may make projects more feasible. 'Mineral deposits are exposed that had previously been under ice,' says Josephine Nymand of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources. In March, Kobold Minerals, which has investment from Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, and the UK-based Bluejay Mining announced they would begin exploring for nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum group metals. Bo Stensgaard, the CEO of Bluejay Mining, says the project will operate to the 'highest standards' environmentally and benefit Greenlanders through jobs and training. But there is no timeframe for when mining might start. Herein lies the problem, says Lill Rastad Bjorst, associate professor at Aalborg University - there is a lot of talk but 'close to nothing is happening'. Greenland currently has only two mines, one producing rubies and another anorthosite. Despite claims about how Greenlanders benefit from mining, 'at the moment, there might be people who benefit from this development, but it's not the people living in Greenland', Bjorst says. Could tourism be the answer? 'We advocate for tourism,' says Idrissia Thestrup, of Visit Greenland, 'because we believe by preserving nature, we can actually avoid taking the resources in the land and potentially destroying landscapes.'  Tourism was one of the country's fastest growing industries until Covid lockdowns brought it to a shuddering halt. But 2022 will be a boom year, says Henrik Ebbe Nielsen, a tourism teacher at Campus Kujalleq, in Qaqortoq, south Greenland's largest town. Qaqortoq alone expects to see an estimated 41 cruise ships this summer, spilling up to 47,000 tourists on to its winding, pavement-less streets. Visitor numbers may be boosted further by an airport expansion project. Qaqortoq will get a brand new airport, with construction starting this spring, and new runways will allow larger, international planes to land in the capital, Nuuk, and Ilulissat, a town famed for its iceberg-calving glacier and dog sledding. But bigger airports mean more aeroplanes, more emissions and more tourists. In some areas, 'the local landscape is very much affected by too many tourists already', says Bjorst. Thestrup says framing Greenland's airport growth as a climate problem ignores its tiny contribution to the climate crisis and its extreme remoteness. But she acknowledges the need to tread carefully. 'We want tourism to be a driver for economic growth but we want to do it at a pace that respects the nature and culture of our destination.' Greenland's prime minister, Mute B Egede, recently set out his vision for a 'resilient economy', one that would ultimately phase out fossil fuels. Alongside fishing, rare earth mining and tourism, he predicts a future for far less tested industries, including using Greenland's abundant hydropower resources with captured CO2 emissions to create green fuels for export. 'As the 'face' of climate change,' he wrote in an editorial, 'Greenland wants to lead by example.' For now, the country is trying to plot a path towards increased economic freedom, while staking its claim for climate leadership. It is a path filled with uncertainty, especially as the climate crisis starts to alter people's way of life, but uncertainty is something Greenlanders are used to. 'You cannot sit down and cry, it doesn't help, you have to just adapt,' Lund says. 'We can do it right,' she adds. 'Greenland is a very sustainable country but it's also the Arctic - nature doesn't fix itself very fast after being destroyed, you have to be careful, it's very fragile.'

However, a source with links to the DLUHC told the Observer that the department is 'looking for bridging accommodation for a group of 600 refugees who have come to the UK, but the people they have come to stay with have been found to be unsuitable'.

It's a very distressing read of rape, murder and brutalisation, but an important one.  Politicians in Berlin are to stay away from gatherings celebrating the anniversary of Nazi Germany's surrender in 1945 this year, amid fears that commerative events could be used for propaganda purposes. Justifying her and her senators' absence at the traditional wreath-layings at the Soviet War Memorial in Berlin's Treptower Park Berlin's mayor Franziska Giffey said:  The Russian embassy in the German capital, which has organised the wreath-layings in the past, has not made its plans public this year due to security concerns. Germany's surrender in WW2 is traditionally celebrated in Germany and western Europe on 8 May. Due to time difference, the event is marked on 9 May in Russia, Belarus, Serbia and Israel.  Berlin's senator for interior affairs, Iris Spranger, said police would seek to suppress any public displays of support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 8 and 9 May, including the beeping of horns at car rallies. The display of Russian flags in the vicinity of 15 memorial sites is banned. The city's decision to also include Ukrainian flags in its ban has been heavily criticised by the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany. Andrij Melnyk said the ban, which exempts flag displays by diplomats, was 'a slap in the face of the Ukrainian people'. A protest march against Russia's invasion, entitled 'No to the war in Ukraine', has been registered at the Brandenburg Gate on Sunday. The Institute for the Study of War has predicted that Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv oblast are likely to advance to the Russian border in the coming days or weeks. According to a recent report by the US thinktank, the Ukrainian counter-offensive north-east of Kharkiv is making significant progress. The report, written by Mason Clark, Karolina Hird and Kateryna Stepanenko, states its 'key takeaways': The leader of Germany's Bundestag, Barbel Bas, has arrived in Kyiv to honour second world war victims and hold talks with Ukrainian authorities about supporting the country further. The governor of Ukraine's Luhansk region has said he is 'hoping for the best' that there will be survivors following a Russian airstrike on the school sheltering civilians in the village of Bilohorivka.  Serhiy Haidai told reporters:  If you missed Daniel Boffey's heartbreaking report on the last days of the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, do it give it a read.  My colleague Daniel Boffey, who is in Kyiv, has been in touch this morning, and has supplied me with the text of Volodymr Zelenskiy's 8 May address this morning entitled 'Address by the President of Ukraine on the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation'.  Here it is in full:  The Ukranian prosecutor general's office has stated that the war with Russia has killed 225 children and injured 413.  The prosecutor general's Office said the figures are expected to be higher since they do not include child casualties in the areas where hostilities are ongoing and in the occupied areas.  Ukraine's ministry of foreign affairs has strongly condemned Russian shelling of a school in Bilohorivka, which is thought to have been sheltering 60 people. In a post on Twitter the ministry said: '#Russia committed this brutal war crime shortly before the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, constantly repeating the tragedy of World War II. #StopRussianWar' President Zelenskiy has compared Putin's invasion of Ukraine to the actions of the Nazis in the second world war, as Ukraine marks its 8 May Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation.  Christopher Miller, world and national security reporter for Politico, who is covering Russia's war in Ukraine, has posted this video released by the president. In it he asks, 'never again? Try telling Ukraine that' and draws comparisons between Ukraine battle against Russia to the second world war fight against fascism. Zelenskiy says that on 24 February, when Russia invaded his country, 'the word never was erased'. Air raid sirens can be heard in the background.  I will now be handing the blog over to my excellent colleague Alexandra Topping in London. Thanks for following along. At least two people have been killed and 60 more are feared dead after Russian bombs hit a school in the Ukrainian village of Bilohorivka, Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the Luhansk region, said on Sunday. Gaidai said Russia dropped a bomb on Saturday afternoon on the school where about 90 people were sheltering, causing a fire that engulfed the building. Thirty people have been rescued. 'The fire was extinguished after nearly four hours, then the rubble was cleared, and, unfortunately, the bodies of two people were found,' Gaidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app. 'Sixty people were likely to have died under the rubble of buildings.' Separately, Gaidai said that according to preliminary information, shelling in the village of Shypilovo destroyed a house and 11 people remained under the building's debris. On the brink of its May 9 Victory Day celebrations, Russia looks very far from triumph in its war in Ukraine. And all of its options going forward are fraught with danger. After a disastrous assault on Kyiv, Russia is engaged in an attempt to take territory in Ukraine's east, as its military nears exhaustion and sanctions continue to escalate. 'With the current force that they have, the push that they're attempting now is all that they have left,' said Jeffrey Edmonds, former director for Russia on the US national security council and senior analyst at the CNA thinktank. 'Militaries just don't recover that quickly from such a devastating loss. And given how effective the Ukrainians have been with our support, I just don't think they're going to be able to achieve their objectives within the coming weeks. And the coming weeks are going to be the telltale of where this is going.' Facing setbacks, officials have suggested that Vladimir Putin may use the May 9 holiday to repackage the war in Ukraine. Dramatic options include escalation through a formal declaration of war or general mobilisation - or de-escalating by proclaiming victory. Alternatively, Putin could offer up a 'sandwich', as one analyst put it, that praises the Russian army's 'victory' while preparing the population for a grinding and painful conflict as status quo.", "846b2fd04cc028c3396f9798faf8883d5812d50a3c67f0ea74380d7b": "Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has brought shame on Russia and the sacrifices its people made to defeat Nazi Germany in the second world war, leaders of the G7 group of leading western economies have said in a statement marking the 77th anniversary of the end of the global conflict. The statement, made on Sunday after a video conference between the G7 leaders and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was intended as a rallying call by liberal democracies in advance of Russia's 9 May Victory Day parade in Moscow. The G7 statement said: 'Through its invasion of and actions in Ukraine since 2014, Russia has violated the international rules-based order, particularly the UN charter, conceived after the second world war to spare successive generations from the scourge of war. 'President Putin and his regime now chose to invade Ukraine in an unprovoked war of aggression against a sovereign country. His actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people.' The leaders also accused him of 'an attack on feeding the world' if he did not comply with international law and end the blockade on Ukrainian food exports. The G7 said it had collectively provided Ukraine with $24bn (PS19.5) for financial and material support since the war started. Separately, in a televised address to the German people, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, vowed Germany would not be paralysed by fear nor allow Russia to dictate the terms of any peace deal in Ukraine. In the joint statement the G7 leaders said they would collectively end their dependence on Russian energy 'in a timely and orderly way', but no precise timetable was set, reflecting the continued divisions in Europe about the speed with which such a phaseout can be achieved. In a clarification of war aims, the G7 statement said: 'Ukraine's ultimate aim is to ensure full withdrawal of Russia's military forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine and to secure its ability to protect itself in the future.' Downing Street said that in his contribution to the G7 discussion, Boris Johnson urged his counterparts to supply the Ukrainians with 'military equipment that allowed them to not just hold ground in Ukraine, but recapture it'. Johnson 'agreed with G7 leaders that the world must intensify economic pressure on Putin in any way possible, and said the west must not allow the war to turn into a stalemate that only magnified suffering', a Downing Street spokesperson said. Johnson also urged his G7 partners to 'intensify their diplomatic lobbying of counterparts failing to apply pressure on President Putin's war machine', No 10 said. Talks between diplomats in Brussels continued on Sunday to try to secure EU wide unanimity on a timetable for a phaseout of Russian energy, but the discussions were described as hard going. Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have been offered permission to continue importing Russian oil until the end of 2024, but they also want help securing new sources of oil and retooling their refineries. Budapest wants a five-year period to wean itself off Russian oil and says it will need a new pipeline connection with Croatia, which has access to the sea. The diplomatic activity came as the US first lady, Jill Biden, made a detour from her trip to Slovakia and Romania to visit refugees on an unannounced visit to Ukraine, where she met her Ukrainian counterpart, Olena Zelenska. On a busy day for VIP visits in Ukraine, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, toured Irpin, a Kyiv suburb and scene of some of the worst early attacks by Russia. The president of the German Bundestag, Barbel Bas, and the Croatian prime minister, Andrej Plenkovic, met Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Sunday. In the Kyiv metro, the Edge and Bono from U2, at the invitation of Zelenskiy, performed alongside a Ukrainian soldier. Bas is the most senior German politician to visit the capital. She took part in commemorative events on the anniversary of the end of the second world war, as well as discussing the vexed issue of German arms exports to Ukraine. It is expected that the German foreign minister, Annalea Baerbock, a surprise advocate of arms exports, will go to Ukraine shortly. Irpin's mayor, Oleksandr Markushyn, posted pictures on an official social media channel with Trudeau, writing that the Canadian prime minister 'came to Irpin to see with his own eyes all the horror that the Russian occupiers had done to our city'. Markushyn said Trudeau 'saw - not military facilities - but burned and completely destroyed homes of Irpin residents, who until recently enjoyed life and had their own plans for the future'. On Monday Emmanuel Macron, the French president, will travel to Berlin for talks with Scholz and to make a major address.", "e6dce55ca0908e446fe5f23dd2a40c5f02e42e8d1fd0685a99614407": "The US has unveiled a new layer of sanctions on Russia, targeting services, Russia's propaganda machine and its defence industry on the eve of Vladimir Putin's planned Victory Day parade. The new measures were announced as leaders from the G7 group of industrialised democracies held a virtual summit with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a show of solidarity. They are primarily intended to close loopholes in the existing sanctions and to tighten the noose around the Russian economy by another few notches. The new sanctions include: *A ban on sales of US services to Russia, like accountancy and management consultancy *No more US advertising or sales of broadcasting equipment to three Kremlin-controlled television stations *Technology export bans including industrial engines, bulldozers and other items that can be used by Russian defence factories *Visa restrictions on another 2,600 Russian and Belarusian individuals, including military officials, and executives from Sberbank and Gazprombank In imposing a ban on services the US is falling into line with the UK, which made a similar announcement last week. The two countries provide the overwhelming bulk of services like accountancy and management consultancy to Russian corporations. The Biden administration sees US service providers as potential tools Russia could use to sidestep the punitive measures already imposed. 'They've been asked by Russian companies to help them figure out how to reformulate their business strategies in the wake of sanctions, in some cases how to get around these sanctions, or in the case of accountants how to hide some of their wealth, and we're shutting that down,' a senior administration official said. Like the UK, the restrictive measures do not apply to lawyers, but the US official said that could change, and that Washington and London are coordinating their moves in that respect. 'We made a judgment at least for now, that if there was a desire to seek due process through a US lawyer, we would allow that to continue,' the official said. 'But we're reevaluating the breadth of these services sanctions every day, and depending on how we see behavior change over time, we can certainly broaden the sanctions.' The new media sanctions will target three Kremlin-controlled propaganda outlets: Channel One, Russia-1 and NTV. American companies will no longer be allowed to sell equipment like video cameras or microphones to them, and US advertising on their channels will be banned. Last year, US companies bought $300m in advertising in the Russian market. 'A lot of these advertisers have announced since the invasion that they're going to cut their business activity with these stations, but we want to make sure that decision endures and just send a broader signal that US companies should not be in the business of funding Russian propaganda,' senior a senior administration official briefing the press ahead of the announcement. The new technology export bans on industrial items such as heavy engines and bulldozers are intended to have an impact on Russian war efforts by hitting the supply chain for defence manufacturers. The US claims that Russia two major Russian tank plants, Uralvagonzavod Corporation and Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant, have already been forced to halt production due to a lack of foreign components. The 2,600 new visa restrictions on individuals include military officials and Russian proxies deemed to have played a part in the invasion and there will be a new visa policy which would apply automatically to military or proxy officials involved in human rights abuses. The targeted sanctions will also hit eight executives from Sberbank, Russian's largest financial institution, and 27 from Gazprombank, owned by Russia's giant gas industry. Until now Gazprombank has been left untouched because of its role in facilitating European purchases of Russian natural gas. 'This is not a full block. We're not freezing the assets of Gazprom bank or prohibiting any transaction with Gazprombank,' the senior administration official said. 'What we're signaling is that Gazprombank is not a safe haven, so we're sanctioning some of their top business executives, people who sit at the top of the organization, to create a chilling effect.'", "c5cf2864e06838aa98d3660a0400067b4ae1c904288eacc27c60fa7b": "", "1d3c86d29d9bdc92402fc014773bffecd761aedcf3f6f9ea90bf4afa": "Sixty people are feared to have been killed after a village school in eastern Ukraine took a direct hit in a Russian air raid, with rescue attempts said by the regional governor to be impossible due to constant shelling. Russian attacks in the east and south intensified at the weekend ahead of Monday's symbolic Victory Day celebrations, with the Black Sea city of Odesa coming under repeated missile strikes and the remaining Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal steelworks in the besieged port city of Mariupol staging a press conference on Sunday saying they had been 'abandoned' by the government as Russian attacks continued About 90 people had been using the school in Bilohorivka, a village 60 miles (97km) north-west of the Russian-controlled city of Luhansk, as a shelter after the previous place of refuge, a clubhouse, had been destroyed in an earlier attack. 'As a result of a Russian strike on Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, about 60 people were killed, civilians, who simply hid at the school, sheltering from shelling,' the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address on Sunday. Serhiy Gaidai, the Luhansk governor, told the Guardian he believed the 30 people who escaped had been outside in the grounds of the building. He said he had little hope for those who were under rubble. 'Unfortunately, they are probably dead,' he said. 'Because the building collapsed. Besides, an air bomb is not a missile, its explosion produces extremely high temperatures. That's why most likely people haven't survived.' Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, has stated he intends to take the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions by 9 May when Russia marks Victory Day and the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. In an address to mark Ukraine's 8 May remembrance and reconciliation day, Zelenskiy said his country paid homage to all those who helped defeat Adolf Hitler but accused Russia of repeating his crimes. He said: 'Every year on 8 May, together with the entire civilised world, we honour everyone who defended the planet from Nazism during world war two. Millions of lost lives, crippled destinies, tortured souls and millions of reasons to say to evil: never again! 'We knew the price our ancestors paid for this wisdom. We knew how important it is to preserve it and pass it on to posterity. But we had no idea that our generation would witness the desecration of the words, which, as it turned out, are not the truth for everyone. 'This year we say 'Never again' differently. We hear 'Never again' differently. It sounds painful, cruel. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. You say: never again? Tell Ukraine about it.' Zelenskiy went on: 'On 24 February, the word 'never' was erased. Shot and bombed. By hundreds of missiles at 4am, which woke up the entire Ukraine. We heard terrible explosions. We heard: again!' Illya Samoilenko, a lieutenant in the Azov regiment in Mariupol, said his fellow soldiers would be executed if captured by the Russians and that surrender would be a 'gift' to the enemy. 'We are witnesses of Russian crimes,' he said. 'Surrender is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives.' Gaidai said the attack on the school in Bilohorivka had taken place at 6pm on Saturday night and had been followed by a constant barrage in the surrounding area that had made rescue attempts impossible. He said a bus had been sent to the village, which has a population of 800 to 900 people, to evacuate the remaining residents on Sunday morning but it had to turn round due to the ferocity of the shelling on the roads. Gaidai said: 'Right now they are asking us, begging us to get them out, but we can't because everything is now under shelling. Around 70 people wanted to be evacuated today. We sent a bus, but it turned around and went back. Not just the village, but also a highway is under shelling.' Gaidai said he had been frustrated in recent weeks that the residents had repeatedly refused to leave despite the growing dangers to their lives as Russia has focused its attacks in the east and south of Ukraine. Earlier on Saturday, eight miles (13km) north of the school, two children died and a further two children and an elderly woman were injured when a missile hit the village of Pryvole, Gaidai said. He said: 'Around a week ago we tried to evacuate around 300 people from Bilohorivka. We'd already settled this, and sent a few buses. But most of them refused to go. So we managed to evacuate only 60-70 people.' Ukraine's prosecutor general said that as of 8 May, 225 Ukrainian children had died since Russian launched its invasion on 24 February.", "f630c17ce83cd2a7abcfc7afa59ab8d06b6bebe927f6a8194b03ab2c": "Jorge, a community activist from Colombia's conflict-ridden Choco province, was already traveling to the city of Medellin when he heard news that made him turn back towards home. Paramilitary militiamen in balaclavas and military fatigues had thrown up a string of roadblocks and declared an 'armed strike', torching vehicles, forcing businesses to close, and stopping all traffic. 'There's absolutely no one around, because any vehicle they find on the roads they set on fire,' said Jorge, using a false name to avoid any reprisals. 'It's total terror.' Since Thursday, cities, towns and villages across northern Colombia have been shut down by the feared Gulf Clan drug cartel, in retaliation for the extradition to the United States of its former leader, Dairo Antonio Usuga, better known as Otoniel. Otoniel faces a litany of drug-trafficking charges in the US, as well as over 120 charges in Colombia - including allegations of murder, illegal recruitment, kidnapping for ransom, sexual abuse of minors, terrorism, illegal possession of weapons and drug trafficking. But even as prosecutors in New York boasted that the alleged kingpin would finally face justice, Colombians across a swath of the country remained hostage to the terror unleashed by his thousands of henchmen. Militiamen have blocked main roads and forbidden everyone to venture out, even to buy food. 'Everything has been shut down since midday on Thursday, practically every single business is now closed,' said one resident in Apartado, a city of 200,000 people in the Uraba region, where the Gulf Clan still holds territory. 'We don't know how long this will go on. The water and power keeps going out, there's no transport, and food is running low. We just have to wait and see what happens.' Videos shared by residents with the Guardian show streets that normally teem with commerce were now completely deserted. 'The state has no control here, so in any moment armed groups can make trouble and destabilise the entire region,' said one community leader in Monteria, the capital of the province of Cordoba. 'Entire municipalities are shut down, buses have been burned, and nobody can leave their homes.' A threatening flyer in the name of the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AGC) - the name the cartel uses for itself - have been distributed in several towns, stating that the armed strike will last for four days, and that the cartel will not be held responsible for the 'consequences that could be unfavourable'. Shops, schools and government buildings were graffitied with the AGC's insignia. 'We are the prisoners, not Otoniel,' said another resident of a village in the region. 'Everyone is confined to their homes, and nothing - not even an ambulance - moves. This is a silent chaos.' Otoniel's capture was hailed by US and Colombian authorities as a major blow against narcotraffickers, but police say that two of his lieutenants, known as Gonzalito and Chiquito Malo, have taken command of the militia, which is believed to have as many as 2,000 fighters, and in addition to drug trafficking is also involved in people trafficking, extortion, kidnapping for ransom, and forced recruitment of children. Colombian authorities have responded to the violence by launching an 'anti-terrorism policy', principally aimed at lifting roadblocks. 'The instruction to commanders is to deploy all their capabilities, and especially to be on the offensive against these criminals,' said a police spokesperson on Friday morning. Analysts say the terror in northern Colombia is a predictable consequence of the country's hardline tactics in the 'war on drugs', which often overlook civilian populations living among traffickers. 'This is a perfect demonstration of what the problem is with Colombia's approach to groups like the Clan del Golfo, in the sense that decapitating them with these large-scale, high-profile arrests like that of Otoniel have done nothing to affect the structure of the organisation,' said Elizabeth Dickinson, a Colombia analyst with the International Crisis Group, a thinktank. 'The daily reality in regions they control or contest continues to involve high levels of social control, a forced recruitment, coercion, extortion.' 'All of that is invisible, but in a moment like this, it becomes impossible for the state to ignore the depth of presence of a group like the Clan del Golfo in this region,' Dickinson said. 'It's actually quite shocking.'", "b4e306f34c822b85984040ebfb51b09667f038f8ff8ca53a78cfa299": "A mesmerised hush fell over the crowd as Joao Camarero took to the stage with his seven-string guitar and plucked the opening notes of a national anthem that has become a symbol of the political struggle for Brazil's soul. 'O land adored above all others, 'tis thee, Brazil,' sang the South American songstress beside him, Teresa Cristina, as thousands of spectators added their voices to the hymn's call for a future of liberty and love. Behind the musicians stood the man the audience hoped could make that dream reality: the former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who on Saturday announced he would seek to return to power in October's election so as to end what he called Jair Bolsonaro's era of tyranny, destruction and hate. 'Brazil needs to go back to being a normal country,' the 76-year-old leftwinger told elated supporters at a rally in Sao Paulo, many visibly moved by the rendition of a national anthem that has been appropriated by Bolsonaro's far-right movement and which, along with the presidency, progressive Brazilians want to reclaim. It was time, Lula declared, for Brazil to decide whether it wished to be a country of democracy or authoritarianism; truth or lies; tolerance or obscurantism; education or automatic rifles; environmental preservation or depredation.  'Never was it easier to choose - and never was it so important to make the right choice,' he said. There was euphoria below the stage as the former president, who governed from 2003 to 2011, outlined plans to build a more stable and compassionate country from the wreckage of Bolsonaro's 'reckless and criminal' rule under which Amazon deforestation has soared and more than 660,000 lives been lost to Covid-19. 'I feel I'm part of history ... and we feel happy to be on the right side of history,' said Maria de Lourdes, a retired bank clerk who clutched a crepe paper flower symbolising her yearning for change. Polls suggest Lula should comfortably beat Bolsonaro, a Donald Trump-admiring nationalist whose radical rhetoric and calamitous coronavirus response mean he is abominated by many of Brazil's 215 million citizens. But analysts, and Lula allies, say Bolsonaro is a formidable political opponent with a ferociously loyal support base representing perhaps 25% of voters. To ensure victory, they believe the former president must build an invincible pro-democracy coalition stretching all the way from the hard-left to the centre-right. 'It's important not just that Lula wins, but that Bolsonaro loses badly,' said the political columnist Celso Rocha de Barros, who fears that in the event of a narrow Lula victory Bolsonaro will refuse to concede, alleging fraud, and launch a coup to supposedly 'reestablish democracy'. Lula's mission advanced at the weekend with the unveiling of his anti-Bolsonaro alliance, Vamos Juntos Pelo Brasil (Let's Pull Together for Brazil). The bloc includes seven leftwing and centre-left parties and hopes to expand before the vote on 2 October. As a gesture of his unifying intentions, Lula named Geraldo Alckmin, the centre-right former governor of Sao Paulo and a one-time presidential rival, as his running mate. The Guardian last interviewed Alckmin in 2006 and the moderate conservative was trekking through Rio's largest favela in search of votes to defeat Lula in that year's presidential election. 'Brazil has not grown,' Alckmin said of Lula's first term in power, blaming his opponent for economic stagnation. Times have changed. On Saturday, Alckmin urged voters to back his once-improbable partnership with Brazil's first working-class leader. 'Lula ... isn't the first, second or third way,' Alckmin said. 'He's the only way [to end] the most disastrous and cruel government' in Brazilian history. Randolfe Rodrigues, a progressive senator who is part of Lula's campaign team and tipped as a future minister, vowed to work tirelessly to build a multi-party alliance against Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper who openly celebrates the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. 'Today was a starting point. Now we need to bring together all democrats,' Rodrigues said, claiming Bolsonaro's relentless threats against Brazil's young democracy meant the coming vote represented an extraordinary crossroads, for Brazil and the world. '2022 isn't an election like all of those which Brazil has held since the return of democracy. In none of the previous elections ... was Brazilian democracy at stake,' Rodrigues said. 'In 2022, it is.' As Lula supporters streamed out of the auditorium and a giant Brazilian flag - another national symbol leftwingers are trying to wrestle back from the right - was removed from the stage, Rodrigues urged his country to seek inspiration from France, where rival politicians recently pulled together to defeat the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in presidential elections. 'Macron's victory was a balm for us Brazilians - the French gave us a great example that we must follow here in terms of tolerance and unity,' he said. Rodrigues said the world was 'living through a species of fascist international, represented by Trump in the United States, [Viktor] Orban in Hungary and [Vladimir] Putin in Russia'. Defeating that movement's South American representative had global significance. 'This is a civilising mission,' he said.", "406ec78caacddeee708fd5313ca6b7e7001947fe7b1b3391113046db": "Working out of the kitchen of their small restaurant in Ontario in the 1970s, Irene Demas and her husband Tony soon learned the value of trading their dishes for the talents of local bakers, craftspeople and artisans. 'Everyone supported everyone back then,' said Irene, at the time a bright-eyed chef in her 20s. In exchange for daily fresh flowers, for example, the couple would take soup and a sandwich to the florist next door. And for an English painter with a predictable palate, the couple struck a deal: they would get a selection of paintings from him and his friends in exchange for grilled cheese sandwiches. By chance, that deal unwittingly netted them a painting by the acclaimed Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis - a work that nearly five decades later is expected to net more than C$35,000 (US$27,000) when it goes to auction this month. Nearly every day after it first opened, painter John Kinnear and his wife Audrey enjoyed lunch at the Villa, a restaurant run by the Demases in London, Ontario. And each day, the only meal Kinnear would ever order was a grilled cheese sandwich. 'Mind you, it wasn't just an ordinary grilled cheese. It was a great sandwich, with a five-year-old cheddar and beautiful bread,' said Irene. Demas would visit artisan bakeries each morning before the restaurant opened, selecting freshly baked loaves and a 'wonderful cheddar that John just loved'. She'd slather on butter, grilling the slices of whole grain bread until crisp, all for C$2.95. But the repetitive order nonetheless frustrated Demas, who would try to coax her stubborn patron into trying new dishes and daily specials. 'He never budged. He just loved that sandwich.' The first painting the couple received from Kinnear was a watercolour of Jumbo, a famous elephant who was hit and killed by a train in the town of St Thomas, Ontario. One day, Kinnear came in with a selection of new paintings. Demas emerged from the kitchen and saw half a dozen pieces propped up on the tables and chairs of the restaurant. 'I just sat there in silence for quite a while. I'd never ever seen any art like that before. At first I thought they might be playing or some sort of trick on me,' she said of the bright colours and simple content of the works. 'Did a kid do some of these?' Kinnear told the couple of an artist he'd met out in the province of Nova Scotia, a woman who was 'so poor she didn't have the right things to paint on', resorting instead to scraps of wood and the leftover paint fishermen used on their boats. 'He felt sorry for her,' said Demas. Kinnear sent Lewis some boards prepped for painting, a handful of which she returned to him with completed works. Of the selection that day, the only painting that stood out to Demas was one of a black truck. She was pregnant at the time and thought the scene might look nice on her son's wall, where it has remained until now. Lewis, who lived most of her life in poverty, was known for her cheery paintings of life in rural Nova Scotia. She often repeated themes, including cats and ice skaters. 'I put the same things in, I never change,' she told a documentary crew in 1965. She painted nearly every inch of the one-room house she shared with her husband, Everett, including the couple's stove. Lewis's output dropped in the final years of her life as she developed rheumatoid arthritis. She died in 1970 at age 69. In the years since, her fame has grown widely and her works increasingly fetch tens of thousands of dollars. A 2013 biopic has only renewed interest and excitement around the unconventional paintings. 'It's just too bad she didn't live long enough to really reap the benefits of her art,' said Demas. With the encouragement of their children, the couple have decided to put the work up for sale, as well as three pieces of correspondence between Kinnear and Lewis, in which she thanks him for his sustained generosity. 'My husband's 90 and I don't think I have another 50 years to hang on to it,' she said. 'The kids are saying, use the money and travel and just enjoy life.'", "0a5719890b3b734253407620b21cc265521b0df586d96ad0c7e4cea7": "", "9acc183b56cac28ee969728c7dc9776618d138062c267115f5dfda6c": "A University College London scientist has accused lawyers in the US of misusing his groundbreaking work on the brain to justify the dismantling of Roe v Wade, the landmark ruling that legalised abortion nationally in America. Giandomenico Iannetti said his research, which used imaging to understand the adult brain's response to pain, had been wrongly interpreted to make an anti-abortion argument. Last week an unprecedented leak of a draft legal opinion showed a majority of supreme court judges support overturning Roe v Wade and ending federal protections for abortions, in a move that could result in 26 states banning it. The court is considering a case, Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organisation, which challenges Mississippi's ban on abortion after 15 weeks gestation. Anti-abortion lawyers in that case argued that scientific understanding has moved on since the court's 1973 ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion, and it was no longer accurate to say foetuses cannot feel pain before 24 weeks. Their argument relied heavily on a controversial discussion paper on foetal pain published in the Journal of Medical Ethics in 2020 by Dr Stuart Derbyshire, a British associate professor of psychology at the National University of Singapore. The paper claims that some of Iannetti's research results suggest we might not need a cerebral cortex - which remains undeveloped in a foetus of less than 24 weeks - to feel pain. Iannetti, an Italian professor of neuroscience who now leads a laboratory in Italy but spent the past 16 years researching at UCL and Oxford University, is adamant that this is 'an unjustified leap'. 'My results by no means imply that the cortex isn't necessary to feel pain. I feel they were misinterpreted and used in a very clever way to prove a point. It distresses me that my work was misinterpreted and became one of the pillar arguments they [the lawyers] made,' he said. Prof Iannetti had no idea the paper was being used to justify the dismantling of Roe v Wade until American colleagues contacted him to say they were 'shocked' at the way his findings were being presented. He helped academics in the US to draft a response for the lawyers but says he feels it is out of his control and 'there isn't much more I can do to stop people claiming my work says something it doesn't'. Leading pain scientists and academic medical societies on both sides of the Atlantic strongly dispute the anti-abortion legal argument, insisting the international scientific consensus that it is not possible for foetuses to experience pain in the first few weeks of existence remains firm and 'irrefutable'. John Wood, professor of molecular neurobiology at UCL, said: 'I thought this opinion piece [by Derbyshire] was inaccurate.' Wood insisted that 'all serious scientists' agreed a foetus cannot feel pain until 24 weeks, 'and perhaps not even then'. He said lawyers were right to say that science has moved on since 1973, but not in the way they were claiming. 'For instance, we understand a great deal more about pain in newborn babies,' he said. 'Interestingly surgeons who operate on foetuses say that there is movement on surgical intervention from week 36.' Derbyshire told the Observer he is 'firmly pro choice'. He insisted that he had not overstepped in his paper, and claimed that while Iannetti's work had nothing 'directly' to do with foetal pain it had 'unsettled the consensus that the cortex is necessary for pain'. He said: 'I don't honestly see how we can rule out the foetus having some raw experience that is akin to pain. It may be for ever unknowable, and it will not be an equivalent to what you or I experience, but that does not make it nothing.' Prof Vania Apkarian, director of the Centre for Translational Pain Research at the Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, who has spent two decades studying pain in humans and animals, said the evidence on foetal pain had not changed since 1973 and remains 'irrefutable'. 'There is no rational basis for arguing a foetus can suffer pain before 24 weeks. The anatomy of the brain is not formed enough for that to be possible,' he said. 'The foetus is in an essentially sleep-like state in the womb.' Apkarian wrote the scientific briefing for the Jackson Women's Health Organisation case, on behalf of organisations including the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in the US and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK. He spent months checking all the anti-abortion scientific references in case his side had missed some piece of serious evidence. 'We hadn't,' he said. Apkarian believes science has been roped into a social and religious battle over abortion in order to play on people's emotions. 'The Mississippi case claimed that the foetus, when aborted, is suffering. They claimed that because it is such an emotionally highly laden statement. But it is also totally untrue,' he said. Dr Meera Shah, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, in New York, said: 'The bottom line is that a patient's health, not unproven theories, should drive important medical decisions.'", "de5195f60221d8b493779b77922492b872d6e929519972b3742c4054": "Voters in the Philippines will go to the polls for a presidential election that pits frontrunner Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son and namesake of the late dictator, against a human rights lawyer who has promised a transparent government. Marcos Jr, known as 'Bongbong', whose authoritarian father plundered billions of dollars from the state and presided over rife human rights abuses, has maintained a strong lead in opinion polls in the run-up to Monday's vote. If elected president, it would mark an extraordinary rehabilitation of one of the country's most controversial political families. Marcos is trailed in the polls by Leni Robredo, the current vice-president and a human rights lawyer who has advocated for marginalised groups. As vice president - a position elected separately from the president - she has frequently clashed with president Rodrigo Duterte, and has condemned his so-called 'war on drugs', which has killed as many as 30,000 people according to some estimates, and prompted an investigation by the international criminal court. Marcos, whose backers have used social media to rebrand the family and whitewash history, has a significant lead in opinion polls. He is the preferred candidate of 56% of voters, according to a recent survey by Pulse Asia. Robredo, behind him, is favoured by 23%. However, analysts say it is possible such surveys have overestimated Marcos's lead, pointing to the large turnouts at Robredo's rallies. 'The reality could be that it is a very close race,' said Ronald Mendoza, the dean of Manila's Ateneo school of government. 'Hopefully [the result] will be settled sooner because that lends itself to a more stable transition.' The Philippine police and military said on Sunday they were on high alert ahead of the vote. 'We are ready for any contingencies,' the armed forces chief, Lt Genl Andres Centino, told a media briefing. 'We are committed ... to ensure that we have a secure, accurate, free and fair elections tomorrow,' he said. On Saturday, the last day of campaigning, Robredo supporters filled the streets of Makati, in the national capital region, with a sea of bright pink, the campaign's trademark colour. 'We have the right to a future with dignity, and we have the duty to fight for it. We have learned that nothing is impossible,' Robredo told crowds of supporters. Robredo is up against two of the country's most powerful political families: the Marcoses, and the Dutertes. The president's daughter, Sara Duterte, is running alongside Marcos Jr for the vice-presidency, though Duterte has not endorsed a presidential candidate. The Marcos camp has shunned TV debates and avoided questions from media outlets it deems unfriendly. Instead, the family and its backers have used social media to reach voters, especially those who do not remember martial law, a time when thousands were killed, tortured and arrested. A network of accounts portray the Marcos period as a time when the country was prosperous and order, inundating news feeds with false claims about the period. Marcos Jr has denied the presence of any coordinated online campaign. Robredo's camp, by contrast, has been driven by volunteer activists who have gone house to house trying to win over undecided voters. It is a strategy that is not usually applied on such a wide scale in presidential elections in the Philippines, and its impact is unclear, say analysts. 'It's something of a puzzle for us political scientists and observers of elections, whether this new thing in this campaign - that voluntarism, the house-to-house campaigns will matter in the final results of the elections,' said Prof Maria Ela L Atienza, who teaches political science at the University of the Philippines. Social media may give the impression that people have a strongly held preference, but this isn't necessarily reflective of society, she added. 'When we look back to previous elections, there was a huge percentage of people in the exit poll saying that they only decided weeks before the election, or even during the actual day of the elections,' she said. People are swayed not by loyalty to a political party, but by other personal factors, including the extent to which they feel a connection with candidates.Marcos, whose slogan is 'together we shall rise again', has campaigned with a message of unity and hope. At his final rally on Saturday, he told supporters: 'We will reach the day that when we join forces, when we again face the world and shout to our friends and wave our flag, we will be proud to say we are Filipinos.' Atienza said the level of engagement among supporters of candidates is comparable to 1986, when Marcos Sr called snap elections - an attempt to prove his mandate amid growing pressure at home and abroad. His claim to have won, amid reports of cheating and fraud, led to the People Power Revolution, which overthrew his rule. It put the Philippines on 'the imperfect road to democracy', said Atienza. The small gains since then could be threatened by the prospect of another Marcos presidency, she added.", "3c060f7cc5f5f7f3f7c05e6b40d8b87907cf21714a83dcab2e8a716e": "A former security chief who oversaw the crackdown on Hong Kong's democracy movement was anointed the business hub's new leader on Sunday by a small committee of Beijing loyalists. John Lee, 64, was the only candidate in the Beijing-backed race to succeed the outgoing leader, Carrie Lam. The elevation of Lee, subject of US sanctions, places a security official in the top job for the first time after a tumultuous few years for a city battered by political unrest and debilitating pandemic controls. Despite the city's mini-constitution promising universal suffrage, Hong Kong has never been a democracy, the source of years of public frustration and protests since the 1997 handover to China. Its leader is instead chosen by an 'election committee' currently comprised of 1,461 people - roughly 0.02% of the city's population. After a brief secret ballot on Sunday, 99% (1,416 members) voted for Lee while eight voted against, according to officials. Beijing hailed the near-unanimous result, saying it showed 'Hong Kong society has a high level of recognition and approval' for Lee. 'This is a real demonstration of democratic spirit,' the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said in a statement. Under president Xi Jinping, China is remoulding Hong Kong in its own authoritarian image after huge and sometimes violent democracy protests three years ago. Beijing deployed a sweeping national security law to stamp out dissent and rolled out a new 'patriots only' political vetting system to guarantee anyone standing for office is considered suitably loyal. Protests have been largely outlawed, with authorities using an anti-coronavirus ban on public gatherings of more than four people as well as the security law. The League of Social Democrats - one of the only remaining pro-democracy groups - held a three-person protest before polls opened Sunday, chanting 'Power to the people, universal suffrage now'. 'This is what John Lee's new chapter looks like - a shrinking of our civil liberties,' said protester Vanessa Chan as dozens of police officers looked on. 'We know this action will have no effect, but we don't want Hong Kong to be completely silent.' While the democracy movement has been crushed, much of the population still resents Beijing's rule and chafes at the city's entrenched inequality. Hong Kong also faces economic difficulties thanks to two years of strict pandemic curbs that have damaged its reputation as a business hub and left residents cut off as rivals reopen. Under the slogan 'Starting a new chapter for Hong Kong together', Lee has vowed to bring in 'result-oriented' governance, forge unity and reboot the city's economy. A 44-page manifesto he released last week stuck to broad goals and offered few concrete policies or targets. Lee has said he will unveil more details when he makes his first policy address. Hong Kong's chief executives find themselves caught between the democratic aspirations of the city's residents and the authoritarian demands of Beijing's leaders. Lam is on track to leave office with record-low approval ratings. According to a survey in March by the Public Opinion Research Institute, about 24% of the public has confidence in Lee, compared with 12% for Lam. Waiting in a line outside a restaurant on Sunday, 25-year-old resident Alex Tam said he and his friends were paying little attention to proceedings. 'It's just an empty gesture,' he said. 'If he didn't listen to the protesters, I don't see how he would listen to young people now, especially those who criticise the government.' Retired businessman Yeung wing-shun was more positive, saying he hoped Lee would guide Hong Kong with a 'firm hand', adding that he believed the new leader could bring different sectors together. Lee will take office on 1 July, the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China from Britain. China agreed that Hong Kong could maintain certain freedoms and autonomy for 50 years after retaking control from Britain under a 'one country, two systems' formula.  Beijing and Lee say that formula is still intact. Critics, including many western powers, say it has been shredded. Lee is one of 11 senior Hong Kong and Beijing officials sanctioned by the US because of the political crackdown.", "f342311bb309bbbac68051cb3bee3fdaababe31ed3d24f68deb0ece8": "Despite everything that has happened to her country since the Taliban seized power last August, 29-year old Nafisa still never believed there would come a day when she would be unable to feel the sun on her face as she walked the streets of Kabul. Yet on Saturday, the Taliban's sinisterly named ministry for the propagation of virtue ordered that Nafisa, along with millions of women across Afghanistan, should ideally not leave the house at all. If they do, they must be fully veiled and never show their faces in public. 'The Taliban has no plans for Afghanistan other than imposing restrictions on women,' says Nafisa, who says she rejects the Taliban's latest attempts to push Afghan women into the shadows. 'I do not accept the obligatory hijab and I will never wear a burqa.' The restrictions require women to either wear a burqa, the head-to-toe covering that allows women to see through only a small grille at eye-level or a full niqab, which covers the face but not the eyes. Most Afghan women already wear some form of hijab, but many in cities such as Kabul previously covered only their hair. Along with the decree, the Taliban issued a detailed set of restrictions and punishments that leave women's family members responsible for their compliance and facing fines and jail if they are seen in public uncovered. If women working for the government go out without their face veiled they will be fired and Taliban fighters will also lose their jobs if their female relatives fail to obey the new restrictions. For many women in Kabul, the decree comes on the back of a campaign of harassment and violence at the hands of the Taliban and their street enforcers that has been mounting in recent months. Young women in the capital who before last summer had never lived under Taliban rule say the religious police force has been emboldened, roaming the streets of the city looking for excuses to question, intimidate and beat women for wearing colourful clothes, jeans or travelling without a male companion. Nazanin, a public university student, was beaten by the Taliban for sitting in the front seat of a taxi about two weeks ago in Kabul. 'They lashed me two times across my back. It felt like my bones were broken.' Nazanin said after she was beaten, the taxi driver was arrested and taken to the police station. Shabnam, 23, who lives in Kabul, says she does not feel safe walking in the streets any more. Three weeks ago Taliban fighters stopped her 12-year old cousin, held her down and cut her hair in public because it was not fully covered by a scarf. Shortly after, her cousin and her family fled the country. 'The Taliban have taken away my very basic right, which is the right to choose my own clothes, and this is very painful for me,' she says. At the beginning of the year, the Taliban arrested several women who protested against the forced hijab and held them in an unknown location until they were forced to release them following international outrage.The latest restrictions are part a concerted campaign to roll back decades of advances in women's rights across the country. When it seized power in August 2021, the Taliban claimed they had changed and would respect women's right to a public life but since then have taken away the right of women to travel alone, to work outside healthcare and to education. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) condemned the face veil decree as the latest attack on women's rights but said it believed it would become strictly enforced despite widespread international condemnation. 'Information that UNAMA has received suggests this is a formal directive rather than a recommendation, and that it will be implemented and enforced,' it said.

A counter-offensive against Russia also appeared to be gathering pace in the north, where analysts said that Ukraine's military may be able to push Russian forces out of artillery range of the country's second city of Kharkiv in the coming days. However, there were fears that dozens of people have been killed in the shelling of a school in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, where Russia has been concentrting its military push in recent days. At least two people have been confirmed dead after Russian bombs hit the school in the Ukrainian village of Bilohorivka, Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the Luhansk region, said on Sunday. Gaidai said Russia dropped a bomb on Saturday afternoon on the school where about 90 people were sheltering, causing a fire that engulfed the building. Thirty people have been rescued but he said 60 people remained under the rubble The Ukrainian claim to have destroyed another Russian ship - after the sinking of the warship Moskva in the Black Sea last month - was accompanied by footage showing what was said to have been a strike by a Bayraktar drone on a vessel docked at Snake Island. 'The traditional parade of the Russian Black Sea fleet on 9 May this year will be held near Snake Island - at the bottom of the sea,' tweeted Ukraine's Ministry of Defence. Satellite photos analysed by the Associated Press show the aftermath of an apparent Ukrainian drone strike on Friday on Russian positions on Snake Island, with thick black smoke rising overhead. Images showed what appeared to be a Russian Serna-class landing craft at Snake Island's northern beach. They corresponded to another Ukrainian military video released showing a drone strike hitting it and engulfing the vessel in flames. Elsewhere, a Ukrainian deputy prime minister said all women, children and elderly people had been evacuated from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. Ukraine had said 50 civilians were evacuated on Friday, but accused Russia of violating a ceasefire intended to allow dozens more still trapped at the plant to leave. The final evacuees followed about 500 others who were allowed to leave the plant and other parts of the city in recent days. Russia's defence ministry confirmed the completion of an operation to evacuate civilians from the plant. In an online posting, the ministry said a total of 51 people had been rescued since the three-day operation started on Thursday, including one person on Saturday. The 51 comprised 18 men, 22 women and 11 children, it added. In Moscow, Russia's most senior lawmaker accused the US of coordinating military operations in Ukraine, which he said amounted to direct US involvement in military action against Russia. 'Washington is essentially coordinating and developing military operations, thereby directly participating in military actions against our country,' Vyacheslav Volodin wrote on his Telegram channel. Washington and European members of the transatlantic Nato alliance have supplied Kyiv with heavy weapons to help it resist a Russian offensive that has resulted in the occupation of parts of eastern and southern Ukraine but failed to take Kyiv. However, the US and its Nato allies have repeatedly said they will not take part in fighting themselves, in order to avoid becoming parties to the conflict. The conflict in Ukraine is taking a 'heavy toll' on some of Russia's most capable units, the UK's Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence report. At least one T-90M, Russia's most advanced tank, has been destroyed in fighting, the ministry added. 'It will take considerable time and expense for Russia to reconstitute its armed forces following this conflict,' the report said. A Washington-based thinktank, the Institute for the Study of War, also said in its most recent assessment that Ukraine's military may be able to push Russian forces 'out of artillery range of Kharkiv in the coming days', providing a respite for the city and an opportunity to build the defenders' momentum 'into a successful, broader counteroffensive'. Meanwhile, several missiles hit Odesa earlier on Saturday, according to a Ukrainian local government spokesperson, after targets in the surrounding region had been hit by four missiles earlier. The strikes outside the city were from four Russian cruise missiles fired from aircraft, according to Natalia Humeniuk, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military's southern operational command. She added that the strike targeted the city of Arcyz and no one was injured. The World Health Organization told Ukrainians in Kyiv on Saturday that the WHO stood by them in their conflict with Russia, and urged Moscow to stop waging war on its neighbour. The director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: 'My message to all the people of Ukraine is this, WHO stands by you.' The WHO emergencies director, Mike Ryan, told the same news conference at the government media centre in Kyiv that the WHO had already documented 200 attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine, and would pass its findings on to those who could assess whether crimes had been committed.", "af79f329c9903563e6de9ac12f111d9773da82b8885babe99d4d92a1": "", "df6624983e0602fce7b2cc9899fcf000408d64b2942bbc9ee8f53bc3": "The government is scrambling to rehouse hundreds of Ukrainians granted visas under the Homes for Ukraine scheme because the people they were supposed to stay with have been deemed 'unsuitable', the Observer can reveal. Refugee charities have warned since the scheme's launch that with most of the refugees being women and children, and many matches made on social media websites such as Facebook, the scheme risked being targeted by predatory men. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC), which runs the scheme, has insisted that no visa is issued until the Home Office has completed checks on every adult in a sponsor household. However, a source with links to the DLUHC told the Observer that the department is 'looking for bridging accommodation for a group of 600 refugees who have come to the UK, but the people they have come to stay with have been found to be unsuitable'. This included sponsors with a criminal record. The refugees have been placed in hotels as an emergency option, the source said, but ministers are looking for better options, including university student accommodation, until they are matched with new families. A second source, who also spoke to the Observer on condition of anonymity, said: 'These 600 Ukrainian refugees had been granted visas, but their sponsors were found to be unsuitable either because they had a criminal record or for some other reason.' Robina Qureshi, director of Positive Action in Housing, a charity that set up the UK's first refugee hosting programme and is matching 1,000 Ukrainians with families across the UK, said it was no surprise that the government's scheme had 'unravelled so quickly'. 'It's a free-for-all matching system,' she said. 'We don't agree with social media as a tool for meeting vulnerable people like this.' Qureshi is concerned that a predatory single man who is only interested in hosting a young, single Ukrainian woman would not be caught out by DBS checks. She said: 'Refugees have been led along by people saying they are registered for Homes for Ukraine, which sounds like some official guarantee when that isn't the case.' Yvonne Kachikoti, head of resettlement and integration services at charity Refugee Action, said: 'The government's reckless and unregulated approach to matching has put vulnerable refugees at considerable risk of ending up in the homes of people planning to exploit them.' She added: 'Already traumatised families forced to leave their Homes for Ukraine host after a nasty experience are unlikely to want to be rematched with another sponsor.' The Local Government Association says it has been flagging up the 'inevitability' of some unsuitable accommodation being offered since the start of the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Its chair, councillor James Jamieson, said: 'We are asking the government to give us information on sponsors prior to matching, so we can get ahead of the game in making checks.' He said councils had been getting more advance information in the past 10 days, but it was 'still far short of what we would like'. He stressed that the Home Office was responsible for checking if hosts have criminal records before a visa is granted. He added: 'There is no check on accommodation before that, no local police check, and no local knowledge applied to people.' A government spokesperson said: 'Homes for Ukraine has stringent safeguarding measures, and they are working. All potential sponsors and adults living in the household are subject to security checks, including criminal records, before visas are approved to allow applicants to travel to the UK. Councils also conduct further checks on the sponsor and their household as quickly as possible once a visa application has been submitted. 'Local authorities will provide emergency accommodation to Ukrainians if necessary. This has not been required for the overwhelming majority of the 19,500 people who have arrived under the scheme so far.' As yet there is no system in place for universities to sponsor Ukrainian refugees. However, Universities UK, the vice-chancellors' group, said 20 universities have expressed interest. Prof David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester University, said: 'We registered our accommodation on the Homes for Ukraine website in March. Sadly, we have no refugees with us, which is so frustrating. We remain extremely keen to do this and rooms could be made available immediately.' He said with many of the refugees being women and children, it was important they could offer 24-7 security, including police community support officers embedded at the university, as well as cooking and social facilities. He added: 'We want to make every contribution, however small, to help those who have been made into refugees by this cruel, illegal invasion, as well as to those who are bravely remaining to fight.'", "0a6763ffe8b67f7043ac790214af542ce57a3df1a2be816cbcfe82e0": "'Holding up', wrote Denys Prokopenko, commander of Ukraine's Azov regiment, in his latest WhatsApp message to his wife Kateryna from the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Speaking via Zoom from Krakow, in eastern Poland, alongside three fellow wives and partners of soldiers living under the remorseless Russian shelling and infiltrating raids, Kateryna, 27, says she is doing everything she can think of to ensure the message at 10pm on Friday evening is not one of her husband's last. It is now two weeks since the last Ukrainian defenders of the flattened city of Mariupol, in south-east Ukraine, withdrew to the sprawling complex of hot and fetid tunnels, along with thousands of terrified civilians, including children. Attempts to evacuate the non-combatants brokered by the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have been successful, with a further 50 people reportedly taken out on Saturday. Last night Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Iryna Veheshchuk, said all women, children and older adults had been evacuated. For the 2,000 soldiers, 700 of whom are said to be injured, hope, however, is quickly dwindling, as has become cruelly clear from the irregular messages coming out of the works. 'The last message was yesterday,' Kateryna says of the text from her 30-year-old husband. I said 'Hold up, we will do everything in our power to save you.'' Russian barrages on strategic targets in the east and south of Ukraine have been intensifying in the lead-up to a historically significant day that has put many on edge, with several missiles striking the port city of Odesa on Saturday. The streets of Mariupol are also being cleared of debris before an expected 9 May Victory Day parade to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany by the Soviet Union - and the wiping out of the final redoubt of Ukrainian defenders of the devastated city. Kateryna, with the other military wives, is appealing for an internationally supervised extraction of the last of the soldiers suffering and dying in the steelworks. They won't surrender, she says, as there is no chance of humane treatment. But she insists that the international community has a duty to prevent a massacre. 'The conditions are awful, there is a complete blockade, they can't deliver water, food or anything else,' Kateryna says. 'They are sharing their supplies with the civilians that are also there. They can't get any medical help. 'Dead people are also there, because it's important for our soldiers to save the bodies of their mates,' she says. 'Refrigerators are barely working. So the conditions are awful. The bunkers are covered with mould, there are a few days left, they might just die from hunger. 'We are inspired by the Dunkirk evacuation. We just need some brave countries that will evacuate our soldiers and civilians by sea or by air. But we need some brave countries to give Russia an ultimatum.' Yulia Fedosiuk, 29, whose husband Arseniy, 29, is a sergeant in the Azov regiment, says she received her last message via Telegram at the same time as Kateryna on Friday evening. 'The way things are going, they have only five days left,' she says. 'He also told me there are two wounded soldiers that may die in 24 hours. They have damaged organs, gangrene that has been getting worse for two months. There is no medication. Some of them have sepsis, necrosis and have lost a lot of blood.' The Azov regiment, which has in the past had nationalist far-right affiliations, was a militia formed to fight the Russians after the invasion of Ukraine in 2014 but has become a unit of the Ukrainian national guard. Yulia, an assistant to a Ukrainian politician, said the mother of one Azov soldier had received an image of her dead son from the Russians. 'We don't want our soldiers to become war prisoners, because there is a lot of propaganda around Azov,' she says. 'Azov is a red rag for Russians, they hate them. If you are from Azov, there is no chance you will come back healthy or alive ... We think our government can take more political and diplomatic steps. They can talk about it more.' Anna Naumenko, 25, a projects manager, received some voice messages from her husband Dmytro Danilov, 29, at 1am on Saturday that she said were difficult to hear. 'He told me it was very hot there,' she says. 'There are no painkillers for people with torn limbs. There are very little antibiotics, and most of them are used for operations only. 'He also told me about a three-year-old girl who lives at Azovstal. She lost her parents, and there are a lot of children like that in the bunkers. She is running around, and pinching the soldiers, saying 'painkiller.'' The women say they believe the British government could rally an international effort. They are seeking to travel to the UK to campaign but are as yet unable to get the visas, as many Ukrainians have found, with the Home Office website warning of a six-week wait. 'My partner is a bit pessimistic, because they were promised help and nothing is happening,' says Olha Andrianova, 31, the owner of a chain of kindergartens, of Serghii, 26, a sergeant in the Azov regiment.

And all of its options going forward are fraught with danger. After a disastrous assault on Kyiv, Russia is engaged in an attempt to take territory in Ukraine's east, as its military nears exhaustion and sanctions continue to escalate. 'With the current force that they have, the push that they're attempting now is all that they have left,' said Jeffrey Edmonds, former director for Russia on the US national security council and senior analyst at the CNA thinktank. 'Militaries just don't recover that quickly from such a devastating loss. And given how effective the Ukrainians have been with our support, I just don't think they're going to be able to achieve their objectives within the coming weeks. And the coming weeks are going to be the telltale of where this is going.' Facing setbacks, officials have suggested that Vladimir Putin may use the May 9 holiday to repackage the war in Ukraine. Dramatic options include escalation through a formal declaration of war or general mobilisation - or de-escalating by proclaiming victory. Alternatively, Putin could offer up a 'sandwich', as one analyst put it, that praises the Russian army's 'victory' while preparing the population for a grinding and painful conflict as status quo. Ukrainian officials in particular have warned that Putin is planning to announce a mass mobilisation, or even to declare war against Ukraine, calling up personnel and resources that were untapped under Russia's so-called 'special operation' that began on 24 February. 'Russia has already moved to covert mobilisation and is preparing to announce open mobilisation in the near future,' said Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, in an interview this week with the Ukrainian news outlet New Times. 'I'm quite curious: how will they explain this to their own people?' The Kremlin has denied it is planning a mobilisation, although some Russians have leaked call-up papers and state orders relating to a potential mobilisation online. A number of enlistment offices have been targeted in arson attacks since March, including one in remote Nizhnevartovsk last week as rumours of a coming mobilisation grew. But a formal mobilisation, which could see tens of thousands of reservists pulled from their jobs, and borders closed to fighting-age men, is something that Russia has never managed before. It would be highly disruptive to the economy and would further raise the stakes in a war where Russia has already disappointed on the battlefield. 'Proclaiming mobilisation will make this war highly unpopular,' said Pavel Luzin, a Russian military expert. He also questioned whether it would be 'technically possible' - 'What can you do with the mobilised people? Which officers and military units can deal with them?' 'This is no magic pill for them, it's not a get-out-of-jail free card for Putin,' Edmonds said, noting that by the time new troops were brought up, the 'Russians could be falling apart'. Fearing defeat, Russia may threaten to raise the stakes even further. Top propagandist Dmitry Kiselyov showed a simulation of a nuclear strike against the UK on national television this week. 'Just one launch, Boris, and England is gone,' he said. 'Once and for all. Why play with us?' Putin may also hint at the potential for nuclear conflict as he stands before the heavy weaponry, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, that he returned to the Red Square parade in 2008. 'He also knows that we're going to be listening to him, so I wouldn't be surprised if there's some nuclear rhetoric in there as well,' said the CNA's Edmonds. He said he remained sceptical that Russia could use a tactical nuclear weapon in the conflict, but like others noted that the Kremlin has become more unpredictable. 'If Putin sees this as becoming existential, then all bets are off the table.' Seeing the limited potential for victory, Putin could also seek to de-escalate the conflict. Standing before his military and the country on Monday, Putin could announce that Russia has achieved its major war aims in Ukraine by allegedly destroying Ukrainian military capacity, and by taking near control of several mid-sized cities such as Mariupol and Kherson. But that may also be a tough sell, as the Ukrainian military could try to retake lost ground, leading to further losses even if Russia stakes a defensive position. A senior Russian official last week in Kherson said that Russia had returned 'forever,' making the idea of a political settlement that would return control of its territory to Ukraine even more remote. And as Ben Noble, an associate professor of Russian politics at University College London, noted, the Kremlin's vague and changing war aims have meant that many people in Russia may be left unsatisfied with whatever Putin eventually claims as victory. 'That's probably the strongest reason why many people say that the Kremlin is in a corner now, that they're stuck, because they're inevitably going to disappoint some groups with whatever they claim as a victory in the broader term,' he said. Expectations of a big announcement on 9 May, he said, may speak more to the frustration among those outside the Kremlin than to the fact that anything meaningful will be announced. 'They want a sense of certainty, they want a new chapter in this conflict,' he said. While the Kremlin may feel political and economic pressure to end the war, a grinding conflict may be better than admitting defeat. 'I assume he will use the 9th of May to somehow address the victory ... something a lot of sociologists tell us is that Russians want this to be over but in a good way,' said Anton Barbashin, the editorial director at Riddle Russia and a political analyst. 'But I would expect that he also needs to introduce some new challenges as well. It needs to be a sandwich, it can't be just victory. There is so much going on, and by now Putin is aware of the economic risks and problems that are going to arise quite soon. So you probably need to propose a strong vision of how Russia is challenged.' That is already visible in state media reports that explain Russia is at war with Nato rather than just with Ukraine in order to justify some of the military's recent defeats. The Kremlin is also facing an urgent ideological challenge, Barbashin noted, as the war increasingly begins to affect ordinary Russians who may not have a clear idea of why Russia decided that it would invade Ukraine in the first place. 'The more I think of it, the more astonishing it is that this war has shown that Russia has no ideology whatsoever,' he said. 'They're trying to come up with something new but none of it actually makes sense. Russians do not understand what the hell Russia is doing there.' While Russia's main military parade will be held on Red Square on 9 May, for millions of Russians, Victory Day is a spectacle that will play out on state television. The national holiday is spent with the TV on in many households, where the parade is bookended by news broadcasts and, usually, by Soviet war films and Russian blockbusters about the second world war. But this year may be different. The parade, which begins at 10am with a review of the troops and a speech by Putin, is among the most-watched programmes of the entire year in Russia. State-affiliated pollsters estimate that more than half of households watch it, although those numbers could be inflated. While rumours have swirled about a major announcement by Putin of a military mobilisation or a 'mission accomplished' message, he usually dedicates the speech to familiar lines about the 'spectre of fascism' and a recognition of veterans of what Russia calls the Great Patriotic War.", "f26d287c1034ab2aaf312c5afd8d18c2b9ccdaa7b0f9f2a830394a32": "The call came around midnight. There was a suspicious man poking around a rundown complex of garages and workshops, police had heard a gunshot and so they wanted backup. The men of the Maidan group rolled out of the bodyshop that served as their headquarters, into a couple of vans with personalised Maidan numberplates and their own ambulance, and set off into the eerie quiet of curfew-hours Kyiv. The alarms this late were usually just for drunks so steeped in booze they had lost track of time and forgotten to go home, said 'Sheriff', who asked to go by his call sign. But the ad hoc group of paramilitaries, who work closely with a police force diminished by war - on call for the local stations and monitoring their radios - are always prepared for something more violent. Far from the frontlines, the war is straining society. There has been extraordinary solidarity across Ukraine, with ordinary people risking, and often giving, their lives to help others simply make it through the day, taking food and fuel to vulnerable and elderly people, or driving evacuation vehicles to pick up those stranded at the frontline. But a minority have taken advantage of the chaos of fighting, the flight of many neighbours into exile, and authorities distracted by an existential threat. There is constant fear of Russian agents, even far beyond the frontline. Security forces say they have arrested more than 4,000 'collaborators' and 140 people planning military sabotage since the war began. And cities are awash with guns, after the government started handing them out to almost anyone who promised to fight, during the early days of the war. 'In Kyiv we are mostly seeing solidarity, but the dark side is more visible, too, now. When you have everyone cohesive, the little that is not sticks out,' Sheriff said. In over two months since the first missiles hit Kyiv, Maidan patrols have picked up opportunists on looting raids, desperate residents driven to steal as the economy collapsed, and Russian spies trying to scope potential targets, gather information or just prepare for orders to come. 'We have to defend the whole country, the guys at the frontlines are the professionals, and we keep their backs,' said Sheriff, who said he tried to sign up for the military after the first bombs fell, but like many in the city was turned away from overwhelmed recruitment offices. 'We want local people to see we are here, so there isn't panic.' Four days earlier, they had picked up a Russian security service (FSB) agent using a fake Ukrainian passport, he said, because the man was acting like a bad spy from a B-list film, driving around slowly, taking photos of sensitive sites and then calling numbers in Russia. In a country filled with rumours and paranoia about saboteurs, it sounded like just another tall tale. But he flipped open his photo roll to show pictures of the man's arrest, his fake Ukrainian passport, stamps in a concealed Russian passport showing multiple entries to parts of Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, and even a picture of an FSB ID card, stored on the man's phone. 'At first I was sad they didn't take me for the frontline but then I realised. It takes six months training in boot camp to fight, but it takes 18 years training to know how to catch insurgents,' said Sheriff, who spent nearly two decades in the police, finishing up as a colonel in the division fighting organised crime. 'It gives you a feeling for people (acting suspiciously),' he added. People they catch, like the Russian agent, often underestimate the group because they aren't in uniform. 'He tried to threaten me that I was the criminal for stopping him. He thought I was just the usual territorial defence who just picked up a weapon. But I was in the police before, so I can eat him for breakfast (when it comes to the law).' The group was formed after the 2014 protests that ousted a pro-Russian president when he suspended plans to sign an association agreement with the European Union. They have been practising since then for a war that others never thought would come. 'Everyone laughed at us 'what the fuck are you doing, there isn't going to be a war'.' They have their own telegram group with 20,000 subscribers so residents of their neighbourhood can reach out directly when they can't get through to authorities. Some policemen from the area fled with their families in the first days of the war, and have not come back, the group said, making it harder to enforce order. And the new demographics of this largely working-class neighbourhood in eastern Kyiv, across the Dnieper River, have also made crime more of a risk. 'Many of the people who left (when the war started) were people with money to get away, and the ability to manage. The people who stayed are the poorest, those with no work.' They include addicts and alcoholics, like the man found stumbling around the garages. He was obviously inebriated, and claimed his home was nearby and he had been drinking for hours and simply missed the curfew. The men called up a local, who confirmed the man's wife would be waiting with a fury that would probably be more of a deterrent than any formal punishment, and sent him on his way. Sheriff's second-in-command goes by 'Kypish', a word for intense action or combat, because he enjoys being part of the action.  'My job is guarding a big shop because in the first day (of the war) it was all looted. It has electronic and construction materials,' he says. The problem is not restricted to the big city. Elsewhere, including the suburban town of Irpin, badly shelled then occupied by Russians and now infamous for atrocities, the invading troops were mocked for a rampage of theft. But in their wake, some Ukrainians took advantage of the abandoned houses. 'At the beginning we were catching 10 a day, now they are very few in number. They are all local, now they are waiting for trial,' said policeman Andrei Suhdolsky. Cars that have been recovered are kept at the police station for owners to collect; for other items it can be hard to prove ownership. However, no one is under suspicion for taking food, he added, because during the occupation people were starving. Back in the empty streets of night-time Kyiv, where the curfew runs from 10pm to 5am, there are also teenagers who don't want to be stuck at home, and some people who simply don't care about the rules and wander out after curfew for fresh air. 'There was a guy out, he said he wanted a walk. We made him do press-ups. One guy is maybe just a mistake, but if there are a lot of them, you have a problem. People here think curfew is just a joke the government made up.' After getting coffee at one of the few petrol stations that stays open all night for emergency workers, and wondering aloud why they hadn't had more call outs, they ran into a problem that has been growing since February - hedgehogs. Not the anti-tank defences set up to stop invading forces, but the small prickly animals. They have taken advantage of the suddenly empty streets to roam more widely than they used to, forcing the animal-loving patrol car drivers to swerve wildly or slam on the brakes, if they want to avoid squashing the little curfew breakers.", "8c84b5ba39d1f4dfda071683cc4fc06e4e3dde44d01f12fc9cc55b8f": "Late last month saw the release of Trevor Reed, a US citizen and former marine who had been detained in Russia since 2019 on a nine-year sentence for endangering the 'life and health' of Russian police officers. Now, Reed's release has increased pressure on the Biden administration to act decisively on the number of other American hostages being held around the world, often for years, without apparent progress toward their return home. One of those is 40-year-old Austin Tice, a former marine and freelance journalist for multiple media outlets, including the Washington Post, who was detained in Syria in 2012. Last week, Tice's parents, Debra and Marc, met with Biden at the White House, two days after Tice's mother, Debra, attended the White House Correspondents' Association dinner. She says she was caught off guard when Biden said at the dinner that he would 'like to meet you and Dad to talk about your son'. The Tices have said they believe that the president's personal involvement will signal to Syria that the US government views their son's freedom as a diplomatic priority. 'Knowing that Biden supports the efforts and wants the same things we want gives them license to pursue these things without worrying about repercussions or making a misstep,' Marc Tice told Axios. But the US maintains an official policy of non-engagement with the Assad regime, and Damascus has 'repeatedly made clear' that they will not negotiate on Tice's case with mediators. That's left the Tice's wondering how the administration plans to act on their son's behalf. 'I left the meeting thinking those were hugely uplifting words. I can hardly wait to see some action,' Debra Tice said. But she cautioned: 'We've had lots and lots of words in the past nine years and almost nine months. We need action.' Tice is a marine veteran who had traveled to Syria in May 2012 to report on the civil war's impact on the Syrian people. On his way out of the country three months later he was detained at a checkpoint in the southern Damascus suburb of Darayya. Five weeks later a 43-second video titled 'Austin Tice is Alive' was posted online showing him blindfolded and held by armed men. Six years later, in November 2018, the then special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, Robert O'Brien, said that US officials believed Tice was alive. He did not provide details. During a March 2020 press briefing, President Donald Trump called on the Assad regime to release him. 'We have one young gentleman, Austin Tice, and we're working very hard with Syria to get him out,' the president said. 'We hope the Syrian government will do that. We are counting on them to do that. 'So, Syria, please work with us. And we would appreciate you letting him out,' Trump added. The Tice family are now hoping that Reed's release in a prisoner swap for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a convicted Russian drug trafficker serving time in Connecticut, marks another rare moment of diplomatic energy around an issue that has largely been obscured under a crush of foreign and domestic political priorities by the last three successive presidents. On Wednesday, Elizabeth Whelan, whose brother Paul is imprisoned in Russia serving a 16-year sentence on espionage-related charges, joined a rally outside the White House to press for greater official engagement on the issue. 'This is not something a normal family, just an everyday family, has to ever deal with. It is horrific.' Whelan later said. She expressed disappointment that US diplomats had not secured Whelan's release alongside Reed. 'The fact that they couldn't get them both out at the same time has re-energized that effort, and I hope it brings back the attention to all of these cases.' The US government says that at least 55 American or legal permanent residents are being wrongfully detained or held hostage in countries including Venezuela, Iran, Afghanistan and Rwanda, according to the advocacy group Bring Our Families Home. The group gathered outside the White House on Wednesday to plead for the Biden administration's attention. Some at the rally said they had repeatedly tried to get a meeting with President Biden to discuss their family's case. 'You have to go to the president, the one who's going to have to make the tough decisions to solve these particular cases,' Whelan said. 'Either that, or there needs to be a better approach to wrongful detention so that we're not constantly knocking on his door.' Everett Rutherford, whose nephew, Matthew Heath, is jailed in Venezuela on terrorism charges, said the issue of American captives demands 'action from the man who occupies the house behind me'. In nearly all cases, the captives are being held by governments that view Washington as an adversary. Administration officials say the release of Americans wrongfully detained abroad is foreign policy priority. 'We are doing everything we can, almost all of it unseen, almost all of it unsaid in public, to do everything we can to advance the commitment that President Biden has to see these Americans who are wrongfully or unjustly detained around the world or in some cases held hostage around the world brought home,' state department spokesperson, Ned Price, said at a press briefing. The most recent of those classified as 'wrongfully detained' is Brittney Griner, the star center for the Phoenix Mercury, arrested in February at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport after a search of her luggage produced vape cartridges containing oil derived from cannabis. The special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, Roger Carstens, 'will go anywhere, he will talk to anyone if it means that we're able to come home with an American, to reunite that American with her or his family', Price said last week. Bill Richardson, the former New Mexico governor who has long been involved in efforts to free Americans imprisoned overseas, including in North Korea, is reportedly also involved in the effort to secure Griner's release. Richardson could not be reached for comment. Robert Saale, a former director of the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, an intra-agency operation comprising hostage recovery experts from across government that works out of FBI headquarters in Virginia, told the Military Times last year that Syria's complex dynamics had worked against Tice's release. 'It's almost like a perfect storm of circumstances, sort of inopportune times, where you've had chemical strikes by Syrians, followed by retaliatory strikes by the US government. It's kind of a two steps forward, three steps back process,' he said. Last week the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said the president's national security team would henceforth remain 'in regular contact with the Tices and other families of Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. 'We appreciate the bravery and candor of families enduring these harrowing experiences, and we remain committed to supporting them and, most importantly, reuniting them with their loved ones,' Psaki continued. Last summer, the Tices said they had grown increasingly frustrated with efforts to secure their son's freedom. 'We are also intensely frustrated by the irresolute, on-again-off-again involvement of our government and its insufficient resolve to secure Austin's release,' according to a statement. But following their meeting with Biden last week, the family expressed renewed optimism. 'Trevor walking free means Austin can walk free,' Debra Tice said. 'Because all of the things that I've been told that cannot be done obviously can be done. And now, I expect that they will be done.'", "e7f376e093716688a06c1c887bfd2f2544f219ab2a3495696aee52cd": "Northern Ireland has slipped into political crisis after Sinn Fein's triumph in the assembly election triggered calls for a referendum on a united Ireland and the Democratic Unionist party vowed to block the formation of a new power-sharing executive at Stormont. Jubilant Sinn Fein supporters celebrated across the region on Saturday when final vote counts confirmed a historic victory that turned the former IRA mouthpiece into the biggest party, with the right to nominate the first minister. Sinn Fein won 29% of the first preference vote and will be the biggest party in the Stormont assembly, a seismic moment for a state that was designed a century ago to have a permanent unionist majority. The party once led by Gerry Adams seeks to abolish what it considers an illegitimate entity and shuns the term Northern Ireland, instead referring to 'the North', presenting an existential challenge to the UK. Sinn Fein's MPs boycott Westminster. In a coded reference to Irish unification, Michelle O'Neill, the party's deputy president, and the first minister elect, said: 'It's a defining moment for our politics and for our people. Today ushers in a new era which I believe presents us all with an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality, and on the basis of social justice, irrespective of religious or social backgrounds.' It was time for Ireland north and south to discuss a new, shared island, she said. 'Let's have a healthy debate about what our future looks like.' Sinn Fein's leader, Mary Lou McDonald, had a message for unionists: 'Don't be scared. The future is bright for all of us.' She added there was a collective responsibility to get the government 'up and running quickly'. 'This is not a time for theatrics, this is not a time for playing games this is the time for grown-up sensible partnership politics, that's what people want,' she said. 'The idea, at a time of a cost of living crisis, that people would stand on the sidelines and allow people to struggle, and struggle badly, for us is unthinkable, so we would appeal to everybody to take stock.' Sinn Fein has been in power at Stormont with other parties for 15 years and has promised to make the region work - but it sent a stark message to Boris Johnson's government that a referendum on a united Ireland was now on the agenda. The party's soaring popularity in the Republic of Ireland, where it leads the opposition in the Dublin parliament, will add to No 10's alarm. Under the Good Friday agreement the secretary of state for Northern Ireland is supposed to call a referendum if it appears likely a majority wants a united Ireland. Polls show most people favour staying within the UK but Sinn Fein hopes to change the tide within five to 10 years. On Saturday night Brandon Lewis urged Northern Ireland's political parties to form an executive as soon as possible. 'Over the coming days I will be meeting with all the party leaders and will urge them to restore the Stormont institutions at the earliest possible moment, starting with the nomination of an assembly Speaker within eight days,' he said. 'The government remains committed to the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement and will continue to work with the Northern Ireland parties and the Irish government to deliver its vision for reconciliation, equality, respect for rights and parity of esteem. 'Together, we must move forward towards a brighter future - that means delivering for all the people of Northern Ireland.' Sinn Fein's victory set up a clash with the DUP, which lost its pre-eminence and slumped to second place, with 21.3% of the first preference vote, a humiliation that underscored a wider crisis engulfing unionism in the wake of the Northern Ireland protocol, which put a post-Brexit trade border in the Irish Sea. The DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, said on Saturday he would refuse to join a new devolved administration until the UK government 'dealt with' the protocol. That would paralyse Stormont, which would be run by a caretaker administration, and puts pressure on the prime minister to amend the protocol to end the stalemate. The impasse is expected to last weeks if not months and possibly lead to a new election. Last week, in a sign of uncertainty in the government over how to proceed, ministers in London made clear they would not be introducing a bill in this week's Queen's speech giving them powers to override the protocol, having previously briefed they would do so. On Saturday, having seen her party increase its number of council seats in Scotland, despite having been in power for 15 years, Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said Sinn Fein's performance in Northern Ireland had highlighted that there were now big questions around the future of the UK as a political entity. 'There's no doubt there are big fundamental questions being asked of the UK as a political entity right now,' Sturgeon declared. 'They're being asked here in Scotland, they're being asked in Northern Ireland, they're being asked in Wales and I think we're going to see some fundamental changes to UK governance in the years to come and I am certain that one of those changes is going to be Scottish independence.' The renewed battle over Northern Ireland's constitutional place in the union came despite a dramatic surge in support for the centrist Alliance, which soared to 13.5%, putting it in third place and showing the growing clout of a third bloc that eschews nationalist and unionist labels. Alliance deputy leader and MP Stephen Farry, said, despite the Sinn Fein success, most voters had supported parties that wanted the protocol reformed or removed. He urged the DUP to work with the other parties to solve the issue rather than 'plunge the UK into a new war with the EU'. Without a first minister and deputy first minister, the executive cannot function fully, with ministers limited to continuing but not making new policy, signing off budgets or introducing much needed health reforms. Senior DUP sources said they will seek an urgent summit with ministers in Downing Street to press home the message that their boycott could put the assembly on pause until Christmas. If no executive is formed the Northern Ireland secretary must call a new election, which must then be held within 12 weeks, pushing the chances of a full devolved government back to December.", "bcdd1fafd22c6f592d6ba86083e318db99e2dd4fd0692308a8a8fda4": "It was over the Thanksgiving holiday, catching up with old high school friends, that Frances Beal heard that Cordelia had died. Like the now 82-year-old Black feminist and activist, her friend had left home to go to college, but she didn't make it through her first year because, like anybody who wanted to terminate a pregnancy in America in 1958, she had been forced to undergo a backstreet abortion. 'She was dead because she'd had an illegal abortion. And it had gone bad. And if you take a look at the statistics, the number of woman that died from illegal abortions was tremendous,' Beal, who later joined the movement to legalise abortion, told the Observer. Now, more than 60 years after Cordelia's death and nearly half a century since Roe v Wade legalised abortion, she fears many more women could die after a leaked draft document revealed that the supreme court looks like it is preparing to overturn the landmark ruling. 'The overthrow of Roe v Wade equals the murder and assassination of women and that's something that I feel in my heart will happen again,' said the author of the pioneering 1969 pamphlet Double Jeopardy: To Be Black and Female. What happened last week should send an urgent warning signal not only to Americans but the world, she said, calling on people to take to the streets in their millions worldwide as they did following the police murder of George Floyd. 'Unfortunately, America often acts as a precursor of things to happen in other countries. And if they can attack and destroy a woman's right to choose an abortion in the United States it won't be too far before the right will be destroyed in other countries around the world.' She said women around the world needed to return to the attitude of women in the 60s to protect the lives of thousands whose lives would be put under threat. It's a basic human right for a woman to control her own body,' she said. The death of her friend enabled Beal to immediately take a strong stance on the issue of abortion access and she told her story to mass meetings in New York. To be facing the same struggle again is both depressing and angering, but she hopes it is an opportunity for women to organise and unite as they did in the 1960s and 70s. 'The question of access to abortion, even as it was legal, was somewhat limited because of class and racial differences. We don't forget that,' she said. 'But we can put aside those class and racial differences, as well as generational differences, and stand together and say: 'No, this is not something that we are going to accept. We didn't accept it back in the 1970s and we're not going to accept it today.'' Merle Hoffman, 76, has been on the frontlines of the movement for more than 50 years since giving up her plan to become a concert pianist. She founded Choices Women's Medical Center in Queens, New York, one of the first abortion clinics in the US. In 1989, she declared a 'state of emergency' in women's' rights in front of St Patrick's Cathedral with a huge coat hanger. Today she continues to use the coat hanger at protests and speeches, and she keeps it in her office. While the latest development is 'a tremendous disaster' and 'an egregious take back of a fundamental human and civil and constitutional right' she said it has been a very long time coming. 'They've been persistent, consistent and this has been their goal, and with the three new conservative judges on the court, they've managed to be in the position where they can actually do this.' Hoffman, who recently helped to found a new organisation, Rise Up 4 Abortion Rights, said it is a 'generational struggle' that she doesn't see coming to an end any time soon. 'It's strange, it's Kafkaesque. In a sense I'm reliving my youth.' After Roe v Wade, she said, many people 'metaphorically put their political feet up on their desks and said 'we've got it covered'.' She added: 'Well, you never have it covered. We have to fight issues in the civil rights struggle again, voting rights, all sorts of things, it's never covered because there's always opposition. It's a dynamic force.' Dr Nori Rost, a minister and clergy leader of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, was still at high school in Kansas when she attended her first pro-choice event in 1978. 'It was five years after Roe v Wade, so it was a strange mixture of jubilation and still maybe PTSD at where we had been because it was still so raw and recent in people's memories,' said Rost, now 59. She added: 'It's just shocking to think that we're back to where we were in 1972 - 50 years later, here we are in the same panic, in the same uncertainty about what's going to happen with people who need to access safe legal abortion.' She also fears the unravelling of abortion rights could also lead to the rollback of marriage equality. 'It's a very helpless feeling that five people can have the right to choose how millions of women in this country can access healthcare to have agency over their own bodies,' she said. 'It's very demoralising.'", "18b59571eef41e0e295345000d2dbe78f42035b467d3563e38ebae7d": "Three US tourists have died at a resort in the Bahamas after falling ill and another was airlifted to a hospital for treatment, island officials say.  Police were investigating and the cause of death was unknown but foul play 'is not suspected', the Bahamian acting prime minister, Chester Cooper, said in a statement on Friday. Their identities were not initially made public. The health minister, Dr Michael Darville, told Eyewitness News Bahamas on Saturday that some hotel guests went to a clinic on Thursday with nausea and vomiting, were treated and left. Three were later found dead. A fourth was flown to a hospital in New Providence. He said environmental health scientists, physicians and others were investigating to ensure there was not a public health hazard in the Atlantic island nation.

'Neve was so excited that it was Mother's Day she got up nice and early to share this lovely card! (Who doesn't love being compared to hot lava ...).' 'The downside is Clarke woke up feeling a bit average and has tested positive for Covid, so we have 7 days of family time ahead of us!' Arden said that she will continue working remotely during her isolation period. 'I'll be working from home so anyone who watches question time, or is attending my Business NZ speech on Wednesday, you'll still see me remotely!' 'Otherwise, a happy Mother's Day to everyone who plays mum in anyone's life. You are as magical as hot lava is to a three-year-old!' she said. If Ardern does contract Covid in isolation and test positive after Tuesday, she will be required to isolate for a further week - meaning she could miss New Zealand's budget on 19 May.", "16f6f036d88fd305de9093c25f6c1cedb7976b11b1e7763ca1ae651a": "Chris and Rosie Ramsey are laughing, and making me laugh, as they tell a story about the other night. 'At one point, this guy got up,' says Chris, 'and his beef with his girlfriend is about her toenail. He says: 'She keeps trying to make me cut her massive toenail.' So we were like, 'Let us see it then,' and she got up onstage and came to the sofa with the guests...' 'And she's absolutely stunning...' says Rosie. 'Stunning lass, gorgeous,' agrees Chris. 'And it was her little toe on her right foot...' 'Thicker than it was wide...' 'Like a solid Rice Krispie. And he tries. And the clippers just don't go down on it.' 'It was,' says Rosie, 'brilliant.' Welcome, gentle reader, to life with the Ramseys. Domestic, honest, intimate, silly, full of vaguely disgusting stories about everyday events you might not recount to your great-aunt, but you would definitely tell a friend. Perhaps you don't find a Rice Krispie toenail funny, but I'd say you probably would if Chris and Rosie were describing it. It is, as Frank Carson used to say, the way they tell 'em. They are funny people and, though this is not true of all funny people, they are funnier together than apart. At the moment, they're bustling around the rooms of a supercool east London house that's been hired for the photoshoot. 'Ooh, these chairs are nice, Chris,' says Rosie, about some outdoor seats. They're having their own new house done up (a six bed-er in the countryside near South Shields) and are at the garden-fouffing stage. 'Not sure about these table edges, though,' she says. 'No good for kids.' Chris is interested in the food on offer. 'All vegan?' he says. 'I'm starting to try that more. Though we did go to a London hotel for breakfast recently and when they said that the chia balls were all sold out, we weren't that disappointed. We are from the northeast.' Do you know the Ramseys? If you listen to their weekly podcast, Shagged Married Annoyed, you may well feel - as I do - as though they're your long-term friends. If you haven't heard it, let me sell it to you. It's an hour of them chatting to each other. Yes, there are regular items, such as the 'Lucrative sponsor opportunity', an excuse for them to bitch about something that's irritating, such as people who comment on how much luggage you have with you when you're on holiday, or who hold their dogs up for you to talk to when you're FaceTiming; more importantly, there's the 'What's your beef?' section where they both bring up something that has annoyed them about the other. Plus, reader's emails, which provide loads of the fun: the very first episode featured a woman writing in about treating her husband to 'his first foursome, next Wednesday'. Really, though, SMA is just an hour of daftness, of the Ramseys being silly and making each other laugh. Both from South Shields, the pair have been together for 10 years and are parents to two little boys, Robin and Rafe. Chris is a working comedian, appearing on Strictly and Taskmaster, and is currently touring the UK with his one-man show. But the Ramseys' humour isn't scripted: it bubbles up and out of their relationship. And it has made SMA one of the most successful podcasts in the UK. Launched in 2019, it immediately zoomed into the iTunes Top 10, where it stayed: it's the only podcast that has ever stayed in the Top 10 for a whole year. As of last month, it has 100m listeners. When they decided to take the show on tour last year, they sold out Wembley Arena in a day. And then they sold out the O2 (the only podcasters ever to do so: they were given a commemorative plaque). Now, they're about to do a BBC chatshow (the toenail story comes from a pilot programme they did the other day). Featuring celebrity guests and an up-for-it audience, The Chris & Rosie Ramsey Show has already been commissioned for two seasons. The website crashed when tickets went up online; they set it up again the next day and yes, it crashed again. Chris and Rosie aren't famous people trying to convince us they're normal; they're normal people who have become famous. 'Are we?' wonders Rosie. 'I don't feel like we're well-known at all. Maybe it's because we don't live in the hustle and bustle, or because we do the podcast at home, and you don't see the results of it all the time... I'm always excited when people come up to us. We try to be nice, and it's easy because people are nice to us.' 'My mam once saw Colin Firth checking into a hotel,' says Chris, 'with his kids and some family and he turned around and looked at her. And she loves Colin Firth. And poor guy, she says to this day he gave her a horrible look.' Rosie: 'He was just busy. He just looked over at a stranger.' Chris: 'She literally has never got over it. That tiny moment where this poor guy is on holiday and just glances at my mam, and my mam takes it utterly personally.' We settle outside in the spring sunshine, Chris in Ray-Bans, Rosie in big round sunnies, to talk about their telly venture. The show is being filmed in the same studio as Graham Norton's show and I can imagine a similar vibe: famous people on a sofa, funny audience interaction. 'It's even more about the audience,' says Chris. 'The guys have sent beefs in, but they don't know who's going to be picked. And we don't know either. We just take the beef out of the envelope and that's the first time we see it and we react.' This is exactly how they did their live show - 'for three-quarters of the show, we didn't know what we'd be doing,' says Rosie. It's the key to everything, they think. 'If someone says something that's really disgusting, if you already know what's going to happen, you're kind of in on it,' says Chris. 'It's about our bewilderment and dumbfoundment: 'What the bloody hell is this?' We don't over-rehearse. We're not those kind of people.' Rosie is excited about the show, but nervous: 'It's a world Chris has been in for a long time, and I haven't. It's really new to me.' Chris: 'But I keep telling her she's got no reason to feel nervous. Some of the lines she came out with at the pilot, off the cuff, so funny, so hilarious... She's so good at it.' He's right; it's Rosie who makes their show work. There are plenty of witty comedians out there, but not many with a funny life-partner who doesn't compete (John Richardson and Lucy Beaumont? Though their shows are written as though they're competitive). Unusually, it was Chris's audience that demanded Rosie join in: in 2019, when he was promoting his Comedy Central solo show, he did some Facebook Lives from home, and Rosie kept heckling. She proved so popular that when he actually did the show, the audience spontaneously chanted her name. No wonder they thought they might try something together. At the time Rosie was - and still is - a stay-at-home mum, setting up mother and toddler groups, gritting her teeth through long summer holidays. Before having children, she'd been a performer, dancing and singing in hotels abroad, working as a Pontins' blue coat, co-hosting a local radio show. She loved it, but had never had huge success. Born Rosie Winter, she's the middle child of three, to parents who are 'grafters': a dad who worked for the Prudential, 'going round houses, collecting mortgages', and a mum who was a nurse. At some point, her dad did a masters degree (he now works for the NHS as a drug and alcohol abuse worker); while he did, the family lived on income support. Rosie's young life was noisy and fun; she has 25 cousins and describes her family as 'big, loud, welcoming, loving, would give you the shirt off their back if you needed it. No money. But full of fun, always up for a laugh. Cry together, laugh together.' ('Every time they get together it's like a Christmas party,' says Chris.) Rosie was an outgoing child, 'a show off', convinced she was going to be an actor or a popstar. 'I don't even know if I was any good, I just loved the spotlight.' She auditioned for London drama schools, but her parents couldn't afford to send her there; she did open auditions for the West End, but got nothing. Chris: 'Didn't you get to the final five or something for a Lord of the Rings musical?' Rosie: 'I did! For the Hobbit part.' This makes Chris howl; he makes a note in his phone. They often do this, to remind them to talk about something in their podcast. One of them will do something silly and notice the other subtly (or not so subtly) jotting it down for later broadcast use. Chris also grew up in South Shields, close to Rosie, though they didn't know each other as kids. His parents, he says, are quieter. 'They would work during the week, go out Friday, go out Saturday, chill out Sunday. Very organised, very nine to five.' His dad worked at the pit, until the mines all closed and he went to work as a delivery driver; his mum worked for the NHS. They're both retired now and, along with Rosie's parents, help the Ramseys out with childcare. He is an only child - 'typical comedian,' says Rosie - who didn't really know what he wanted to do with his life, though he knew he liked making people laugh. He can remember being 11 or 12, and going on holiday with his parents and meeting some strange posh kids and thinking, 'I'll tell everyone about them when I get back. And when I did,' he says, 'there was this moment where all my mates were sitting cross-legged on a driveway and I was standing up next to the fence, on a little patch of grass, and I was telling them all about my holiday, and they were falling about. And something clicked.' He started constructing little routines in his head, but it wasn't until he left school and was at university that a friend, Carl Hutchinson, now also a comedian, told him about open spots at comedy shows. 'It was this moment where someone pulled the curtain back and went, 'There's a door here.' And I just belted through it and never looked back.' Chris can remember his first show; he told a joke about STIs and Marks & Spencer. It was at the Dog and Parrot in Newcastle. ('It's near the Arena,' says Rosie, 'and every time he does the Arena now, it's like: 'I was just over there, the Dog and Parrot.' Every time. I feel like you have to say it now, because if you don't say it, it's all going to go away.') Though they remember seeing each other around when they were young (Rosie dated an older guy from Chris's estate when she was 14), and went to the same sixth-form college, it wasn't until 2012, when they bumped into each other at a local nightclub, that they got together; once, Rosie said, she realised Chris wasn't quite as cocky as she'd thought. Chris appeals to women: his comedy audience has always skewed more female and it's similar for SMA, especially now Rosie's there. Fans tend to be younger than the Ramseys, in their early 20s, and what Chris and Rosie are about, very definitely, is bringing them all together. 'Some comedians can walk into a room,' says Chris, 'and they can do a massive bit on, like, Brexit. And they can split the room in half, and go, 'That was good.' But in my eyes, I think they died on their arse because half those people hated them. It's clever, but you're there to make them laugh, dude.' For this reason, on the podcast they steer clear of divisive topics, like football or politics, though I did notice that in one episode, they brought up the government's many lockdown cheese and wine parties. Rosie: 'We do talk about politics at home, we're interested in it. We live in this world and we're of an age where we've got mortgages, we've got children. But we just don't feel like it needs to be in our show. Also, I don't know about you, but I change my opinion all the time...' Chris: 'But when something is as cut and dried as, they had parties when we weren't allowed, there can't be anyone emailing in going, 'How dare you? They deserved those parties.' Wine and cheese parties, when people are waving at their grandkids through windows? I'm never going to change my opinion on that.' Rosie: 'There's nothing to argue about.' From there we veer off on to Will Smith (they are huge fans, especially Chris: 'It was awful, the Oscars, like watching your dad lose his temper properly, like him having a fight in the pub'); how Chris went away on tour just 10 days after Robin was born: 'Really, really hard,' says Rosie, 'and I tried to do everything myself'; how Chris is stuck in his ways: 'I listen to Absolute 80s, I've got the Guardians of the Galaxy playlist and I watch Family Guy and UFC on the telly'. They let each other speak, they chime in with jokes and support; they really do seem to have a good working marriage, and they're sure the podcast has improved it. After all, serious relationship counsellors often advise couples to have a weekly conference in order to talk through differences. 'Obviously we have rows,' says Rosie. 'We don't go straight to the podcast and laugh about it. You have time to mellow, and then you have a nice day, and you're friends again. Then being able to talk about it after is really healthy.' Chris: 'It can be really bad in the moment, because Rosie's better at it then, but, later on, I can pull it apart on the podcast and get an apology. It's a very clever system.' Rosie: 'Yeah, he comes on the podcast and annihilates me. And I'm like, 'But I won this in the moment!' Chris: 'Do you know what I remembered the other day? Years ago, before we did the podcast, your mam would come round, and you would kick off at me because I would roast you in front of people. I'd be like, 'Sandra, do you see what she's done with this dishwasher?'' Rosie: 'Yes, you did that all the time. I hated it. Why would you just rip the piss out of me in front of people?' Chris: 'And now we do it for a job!'

Speaking at a rally in Sao Paulo, where the one-time lathe operator began his spectacular rise to power as a union leader more than four decades ago, Lula publicly spelled out his ambition to reclaim the presidency for the first time. 'I am certain that we are going to manage to stage the greatest peaceful revolution the world has ever seen,' the 76-year-old leftist told thousands of supporters, who had gathered for the launch of what Lula called a cross-party anti-Bolsonaro alliance called Vamos Juntos Pelo Brasil, or Let's Pull Together for Brazil. 'We have a dream. We are moved by hope - and there is no force greater than the hope of a people who know they can be happy once more ... Once again we are going to care for Brazil and the Brazilian people,' Lula said. The seats before him were filled by a who's who of the Brazilian left, as well as celebrities, intellectuals, union leaders and grassroots activists who had travelled from all across the country - united in their desire to stop Bolsonaro returning to power when nearly 150 million Brazilians choose their next leader in October. 'Bolsonaro represents the death of our people, our extermination ... Lula's the opposite - he represents hope,' said Nathalia Purificacao, 23, an Afro-Brazilian activist from Bom Jesus da Lapa in the north-eastern state of Bahia. Ademario Nogueira, a 58-year-old campaigner from the capital, Brasilia, brandished a portrait of his bearded leader. 'He's the horseman of hope,' Nogueira said of Lula, a two-term president from 2003 to 2010 who was barred from the 2018 election after being jailed on controversial corruption charges that were annulled last year. Opinion polls suggest Lula is on course to win his sixth presidential run since he first tried to become the leader of South America's largest democracy in 1989. One survey, released on the eve of Lula's announcement, gave him a 13% lead over Bolsonaro in the first round and a 20% lead in a second round runoff. Sixty per cent of voters said they would not vote for Bolsonaro - who is widely blamed for mishandling a Covid outbreak that has killed nearly 665,000 citizens - under any circumstance. More than 60% believe the economy is going in the wrong direction, with rising inflation, high unemployment and a growing cost of living crisis. 'It's Lula's to lose, clearly,' said Felipe Nunes, the head of the polling group Quaest. Even so, in recent weeks there have been signs of nervousness among Lula allies and progressive Brazilians desperate to see the back of Bolsonaro, after a series of unforced bloopers from the veteran leftist. Last weekend Lula was forced to apologise after suggesting police officers were not human beings. This week he was criticised for claiming the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, were equally to blame for the war there. 'If Lula carries on with this verbal incontinence ... he'll give the current occupant of the presidential palace a serious shot at re-election,' the Brazilian author Paulo Coelho warned on Twitter. Some critics complain Lula has failed to offer a clear vision for the future and is relying too heavily on rekindling nostalgia over his two-term presidency, when a global commodity boom helped him pump vast sums into poverty reduction schemes and infrastructure projects. In an interview with Time magazine, published on the eve of Saturday's event, Lula declared: 'Instead of asking what I will do, just look at what I have done'. Those accomplishments - which included helping millions escape poverty and expanding access to education - were given centre stage at Saturday's event in Sao Paulo, the city to which a 10-year-old Lula moved in 1955, three years after his family fled rural hardship in the north-eastern state of Pernambuco. The auditorium was plastered with photographs remembering Lula's years in power. Before his speech, videos were shown in which he appeared alongside global figures such as Barack Obama, George W Bush and Queen Elizabeth. 'He's the best president in the history of Brazil,' said Nogueira, an activist from Lula's Worker's party (PT). 'Brazil is desperate to be happy again.' Lula, who was freed up to run in the 2022 election after the supreme court annulled his convictions, told supporters that at the coming election Brazil would have the chance to decide which country it wanted to be. 'The Brazil of democracy or authoritarianism ... The Brazil of knowledge and tolerance or the Brazil of obscurantism and violence, of education and culture or of revolvers and rifles.' 'It has never, ever been so easy to choose,' Lula added with a smile. 'And never has it been more important to make the right choice.' Also on show was Lula's attempt to build a broad coalition capable of defeating Bolsonaro, including parties from outside the left. Lula's running mate, the centre-right former Sao Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin, was unable to attend after contracting Covid but in a video message told the audience that unity was essential to protect democracy and defeat 'the most disastrous and most cruel government in Brazilian history'. Juliano Medeiros, the president of the leftwing Socialism and Liberty party (PSOL), said it was essential for the opposition to coalesce, as it failed to do before Bolsonaro's shock 2018 election. The anti-Bolsonaro movement also urgently needed to ensure the 2022 campaign was based on exposing Bolsonaro's failures and the real economic problems facing Brazil's 215 million citizens. 'In 2018 it was Bolsonarismo and the far right that set the agenda: it was all about anti-communism and corruption and culture wars. This time our challenge is to put unemployment, inflation, hunger and equality at the centre of the debate,' Medeiros said, as delegates streamed into the convention centre. Activists voiced optimism that Bolsonaro's days in power were numbered. 'I don't have the words to describe my happiness,' said Susy Keith, a 45-year-old producer from Rio who was dressed as a bright red star. However, many progressives feel profound trepidation over the coming months, with Brazil's pro-gun president billing the election as an epochal struggle between ultraconservative 'good' and the 'evil' left. 'My main worry is violence. I think there's a real chance we will see fighting in the streets. These are going to be the most polarised elections on Earth,' said Celso Rocha de Barros, a columnist for the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. On Saturday Lula urged supporters to resist provocation during the campaign and to face their opponents with love, not hate. 'We are going to win this battle for democracy with smiles, affection, love, peace and harmony,' he said.", "d1994f0a5be62d4a3bf5afd8f303c6639ff8ab66dfe65e891da74115": "At least 14 Cypriots were tortured then murdered by UK forces during an armed uprising in the late 1950s, according to newly unearthed evidence that raises fresh questions over another shocking chapter of Britain's colonial history. Testimony from British veterans and Cypriot rebel fighters, along with postmortem and morgue records, as well as previously undisclosed material from Cypriot archives, suggest that the victims died after being interrogated by UK officers. The dead, all men aged between 17 and 37, were arrested on suspicion of being part of the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters, a paramilitary organisation known as EOKA, which orchestrated a guerrilla campaign to overthrow British control in Cyprus. Photographs from the Cyprus National Archives corroborate signs of torture on their bodies. In some cases, the images appear to show mutilation of the genitals. A witness to one of the deaths said: 'I saw the soldiers pulling Nicos [Georgiou] out of his cell, almost unconscious, with foam coming out of his mouth. He was making an awful sound like a lion growling as he lay dying. They let him die on the cement outside.' Although claims that the British military used torture during their occupation of Cyprus have circulated for years, it is the first time that UK forces, including its intelligence services, are accused of a campaign of extrajudicial killings during the 1955 to 1959 uprising. In 2019, the UK government paid PS1m damages to 33 Cypriots who alleged they were tortured by British forces. Among them was a girl, 16 years old at the time, who said she was repeatedly raped by soldiers. Although the government insisted the payout was not 'any admission of liability', the fresh details will sharpen scrutiny over the true extent of atrocities committed during the campaign to end British colonial rule on the Mediterranean island. The new claims feature in a book, 14 Crimes of Empire, published in Greek, which investigates the circumstances behind the deaths of the 14 men. Elina Stamatiou, the Cypriot author who spent three years investigating the deaths, said the UK government needed to acknowledge its role in their fate. 'Justice must be served. I also think that an official apology to the families of these victims would be very important, even if it comes 65 years later. The families' wounds are still open,' she said. In what was known as the Cyprus emergency, EOKA launched an insurgency against British authorities who insisted that the island should 'never have self-determination'. In response to the insurrection, Cyprus was flooded with thousands of British soldiers in an ultimately futile attempt to crush the island's hopes of independence. Some 371 British soldiers died, compared with around 90 EOKA fighters. Among them was Georgios Christoforou, 18, who was arrested in the city of Paphos in 1958. Fellow detainees witnessed him being escorted into a British interrogation room and emerging with his 'face covered with blood and he could not walk'. One recalled 'moaning and noises' coming from the room and later heard Christoforou screaming. Another witness testified that he heard the teenager's interrogator say: 'If you do not tell us the truth, we shall kill you.' Images of Christoforou in the morgue show his face bloodied and disfigured. Clinical documents show that he died from internal injuries on 22 November 'whilst in custody from injuries due to a blow or fall or some other form of violence but there is no evidence to show when, where, how and in what manner he received the injuries which caused his death'. One of the youngest of the 14 men allegedly killed in detention by the British was 17-year-old Lucas Louka, an EOKA member who died in the city of Famagusta in 1958 after what appears to be a brutal beating from an English military police officer. Photographs from the morgue indicate signs of baton strikes on his back, with the fatal blow on the left side of his head. A friend of Louka's said he saw him being 'assaulted' by a British military captain. Another saw the teenager attacked 'with a heavy rod' by the same officer. The friend added: 'He started beating the deceased everywhere, on the head, body. I saw Louka lying on the bed and the captain beating him.' Veteran EOKA fighter Michalakis Moustakas described how Nicos Georgiou, 37, who was arrested in the village of Platres, died in detention. Held in a cell next to Georgiou, Moustakas said they were forced to sleep naked on cement, were fed urine, repeatedly beaten and dragged by their genitals. The witness, now 86, said he watched Georgiou being dragged out of his cell with foam coming from his mouth. 'Every night when I go to bed, I can still hear his growling sound while dying,' said Moustakas. Images taken in the morgue show Georgiou's body covered with bruises along with head injuries. British veterans who served in Cyprus have also offered accounts that contradict the UK's official version. A senior officer wrote an account of the death of EOKA member Spyros Hadjiyiacoumi. The late major Michael Stourton attempted to raise his concerns over the torture of the 27-year-old father of four at a British interrogation centre in the town of Kythrea. His efforts to flag the issue were quashed by Ministry of Defence censors who erased the chapter from the official history of the Grenadier Guards. Two other EOKA members who were tortured in the same hut as Hadjiyiakoumi but survived told how British interrogators placed a metal bucket on their heads and struck it, and stabbed their feet with a bayonet. The coroner's report from the time claimed the injuries 'were caused during an unsuccessful attempt to escape from lawful custody'. Another British veteran also offered key evidence into the death of another of the 14 - Andreas Panayiotou, a 31-year-old EOKA member who died in a Platres hotel requisitioned by the British army. Brian Robertson, 85, who served in Platres with the Gordon Highlanders from October 1955 to December 1956, said that a friend called Kevin Taylor, who served in the military medical inspection room, told him that a detainee had died after being tied up in a freezing water fountain all night. Robertson, from Aberdeen, said the chief doctor was apparently horrified and refused to sign the death certificate, forcing the officers involved to summon another doctor from the Cypriot capital, Nicosia. 'They had to get another old army doctor to sign the death certificate. I am certain the British did engage in the use of torture,' Robertson said. Two of the bodies of the 14 men identified by Stamatiou are still missing and are believed to be secretly buried. British accounts state that both men managed to escape from detention, though neither has been seen since. One of them - 27-year-old Nicolaos Yiangou - was last seen being driven away in a black Morris minor car after being interrogated by British secret services, police and soldiers. The British military continues to operate two bases in Cyprus, one close to the city of Limassol and one in Dhekhelia. The Foreign Office referred its current position to a 2019 statement from then Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan which said that the 'passage of time means that it is now no longer possible to establish all of the facts with certainty.' It added:  'The UK government acknowledges the strongly held views of many Cypriots about the emergency' and said that the violence was a 'matter of regret.'", "569efff6079a19c9bbdc86dabd30665ac438323186897d0f1da5b896": "", "11e0934a22b8794c2ed433a2e89c15fd8a88d217c49f601908ed7530": "Amber Heard was asked in court last week if she recognized the name Carly Simon, soon after her attorneys introduced an exhibit of a mirror that Johnny Depp had defaced in tight, punctuated script after severing part of his middle finger in what his former wife described as a drug- and alcohol-induced blackout. Depp's note read: 'Call Carly Simon. She said it better. Bye.' Heard testified she wasn't familiar with Simon or her work. But Depp, one can reasonably speculate, was referring to You're So Vain, Simon's 1972 hit. His attorneys may take up the issue on cross-examination the week after next. Or the week after that. So it goes with the Depp-Heard defamation case in Fairfax, Virginia. A cautionary tale, certainly, with disturbing allegations of domestic and sexual violence. But also a man-woman fight, part gender-switch Sunset Boulevard, part Mean Girls, with flashbacks and still images taken - appropriately enough given the sinister if not vampiric nature of the relationship - in Bela Lugosi's old house. Which narrative jurors choose will not be known until after 27 May, when attorneys will deliver closing arguments. For now, with the court out next week - the judge, Penny Azcarate, is at an unrelated judicial conference - jurors are left to mull the last two days of Heard's take on her turbulent marriage. 'Two skilled actors on the stand as witnesses could be equally resonant without regard to exactly where the truth is in their narratives,' said Nancianne Aydelotte, a New Jersey lawyer. 'This is very challenging for jurors, who might find what the plaintiff said to be compelling and is then equally moved by the defendant.' Heard's testimony, highly charged at times, has been delivered while keeping eye contact with jurors. Depp has kept his head down, occasionally consulting with his lawyers, usually when he seems to find something implausible - for example, that he ingested eight to 10 ecstasy pills in one sitting in Australia, or took quaaludes in Los Angeles. Heard's overall story is that she was courted and seduced, was bought a colt, and fell madly in love with a movie star - 'when I was around Johnny I felt like the most beautiful person in the world' - while the world beyond their 'bubble' was kept in abeyance. 'We weren't doing normal life stuff,' Heard said. 'We weren't stuck in traffic with each other, we weren't going to the grocery store and doing life. We were hiding in these places around the world.' That bubble, she testified, started to deflate when Depp began to disappear and she didn't know how to find or reach him. Heard argued that Depp became threatened by her career and jealous of her co-stars. She testified that Depp threatened her life shortly after the pair were married, and that just weeks later, in Australia while filming the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie, he sexually assaulted her with a bottle of Maker's Mark.'I'll fucking kill you,' Heard alleged that Depp yelled. 'I was scared,' she added. 'I had just married him.' Months later, Heard alleged, Depp broke her nose and ripped out chunks of hair in another violent encounter. Depp has testified that he never hit Heard, and that she was the one who was the abuser, including when she threw a bottle of vodka at him, severing his finger. Heard testified that in her effort to help Depp get sober, she sought help through Al-Anon, and sought to distance herself from the relationship, but was drawn back in whenever Depp achieved brief periods of sobriety and when the 'monster' that the pair called his intoxicated persona was subdued. But at each turn, she said, his efforts were hindered by an entourage - his security team, assistants, hangers-on - who shielded him from the consequences of his drug and alcohol use. In London, she said, his security carried him into their rented home 'like a baby'. Some of the most interesting testimony of the past week came from Depp's accountants. One estimated that Depp had lost $40m in earnings as a result of Heard's 2018 Washington Post opinion piece, in which she described herself as 'a public figure representing domestic abuse'. Hollywood dealmaker Richard Marks, a Depp witness, told the court that the film-making community had interpreted Heard's message loud and clear. 'That actor is synonymous with the product,' Marks said. 'When hiring that actor or actress, you want a reputation that supports the value that you spent on creating that product. Especially in the last five years, with the #MeToo movement, you wouldn't want negativity hiring an actor who, quote-unquote, had been canceled.' Outside of the proceedings, Heard's PR team have accused Depp of failing to take responsibility. 'One of Ms Heard's disappointments is Mr Depp's inability to distinguish fact from fiction - a malady which appears to have spread to his legal team,' a spokesperson said in email to reporters on Friday. A Depp flack countered that Heard had delivered 'the performance of her life' and that his attorneys look forward to cross-examining her. Public relations experts are divided over the consequences of Depp's $50m defamation claim and Heard's $100m counter-claim. 'This case should serve as a cautionary tale to high-profile people living in the public eye: when you decide to make an abuse allegation, or discuss your personal life in the form of an op-ed, a televised interview, or conversation with a reporter, you run the risk of having to publicly discuss all sorts of ugly private details,' says Evan Nierman at Red Banyan. 'It's remarkable that Heard chose to author the op-ed that started this entire saga, and that Depp decided to pursue legal action, given that both have more skeletons in their closets than a haunted house.' But Juda Engelmayer at Herald PR says that no matter what the verdict in the case, Depp has afforded himself the opportunity to make his case in the court of public opinion. 'He got to tell his narrative rather than have it be told by Heard in the Washington Post. He entertained, and ended up getting a lot of people, including female audiences members, on his side. That's how he wins, whatever the verdict, because he wants the world to see that he is still capable of producing fans and producing entertainment.' For Heard, the issue may be more complex. 'She was considered a hero for putting out her narrative, so now she comes out more of a hero for taking the abuse in her marriage, if believed, and for taking abuse in court last week when he was entertaining, witty, taking it lightly and getting laughs. 'She's coming off looking good also,' says Engelmayer. 'She's being strong, bold and unafraid, sitting up there telling her story. She's straightforward, and not backing away from it, and fighting for what she believes is right.' Depp, Engelmayer believes, will slowly find his way back into movies, though perhaps not as prominently as before. Heard, he says, also will find her way back. 'She'll get recast in some films to test the waters to see if she has that moxie. She was never as big as Depp, but a lot of studios may think putting her in is a good draw for women, and for progressives who think she was strong and deserves a chance. She'll get the roles, and the box office will tell if she can command them.'", "9e31642f8636428b59571029695a031c7ccd910fc6c495a302310bc2": "A Biden administration official warned Friday that there could be 100m Covid-19 infections this fall and winter, potentially spurring a surge in hospitalizations and deaths. The White House is preparing backup plans for providing vaccines to US residents if lawmakers refuse to provide more funds for coronavirus response efforts, the New York Times reported. The White House has ramped up efforts to boost the country's preparedness and urge Congress to allocate billions to buy additional vaccines, therapeutics and tests, but additional emergency funding is uncertain. Biden has requested $22.5bn for Covid-19; Republicans have pushed for just $10bn, however, and removed $5bn in international coronavirus assistance from this request, the Times said. The US coronavirus death toll is expected to reach 1m this week. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said last week that 60% of US residents have been infected with Covid-19, the Washington Post reported. The official's dire projection was based on several models, not new data, and was not a formal prediction. These models operate with the premise that Omicron and its sub-variants will keep driving community transmission - and that a significantly different strain will not emerge, according to the Washington Post. This prediction was also made with the assumption that there will not be additional federal aid, the Times reported. The model also assumed that many vaccinated people, and persons who were previously infected, would get Covid-19 again. Several public health experts say that a dramatic wave during cold-weather months is possible, as immunity from vaccines declines over time. This drop in immunity comes amid variants that are more capable of evading immunity - and as officials continue to relax public health restrictions, the Post said. The officials projected that the surge would start in the south - where vaccination and booster rates lag - as more people congregate indoors. Authorities fear the uptick will tear through the supply of tests and anti-viral treatments, leaving the US ill-prepared to combat the fall and winter uptick, the Post said. On Friday, the seven-day US average of new infections totaled almost 71,000 - more than twice the 29,312 weekly average just five weeks ago. Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina's school of global public health, told the Post: 'What they're saying seems reasonable - it's on the pessimistic side of what we projected in the Covid-19 scenario modeling run.' 'It's always hard to predict the future when it comes to Covid, but I think we're at a point now where it's even harder than normal,' Lessler continued. 'Because there's so much sensitivity, in terms of these long-term trends, to things we don't understand exactly about the virus and about [human] behavior.'", "3830a369a6d992e1d5241163202f46126bb27072435b191c58a934f2": "Afghanistan's Taliban leaders have issued an order that all Afghan women should wear the all-covering burqa in public. The move confirms the worst fears of rights activists and is likely to further complicate Taliban dealings with an already distrustful international community. 'We want our sisters to live with dignity and safety,' said Khalid Hanafi, the acting minister in the Taliban's vice and virtue ministry, as it announced a decree that evoked similar restrictions on women during the Taliban's hardline rule between 1996 and 2001. The Taliban previously decided against reopening schools to girls above the age of 12, reneging on an earlier promise and opting to appease their base at the expense of further alienating the international community. That decision disrupted efforts by the Taliban to win recognition from potential international donors at a time when the country is mired in a worsening humanitarian crisis. Shir Mohammad, an official from the vice and virtue ministry, said: 'For all dignified Afghan women, wearing hajib is necessary and the best hajib is chadori [the head-to-toe burqa], which is part of our tradition and is respectful.' The decree added that if women had no important work outside it was better for them to stay at home. 'Islamic principles and Islamic ideology are more important to us than anything else,' Hanafi said. Most women in Afghanistan wear a headscarf for religious reasons, but many in urban areas such as Kabul do not cover their faces. The Taliban have faced intense pushback, led by western governments but joined by some religious scholars and Islamic countries for their growing limits on women's rights. The US and other nations have cut development aid and enforced strict sanctions on the banking system, pushing Afghanistan towards economic ruin.

The former insurance boss was the first outsider to lead the now 157-year-old bank, which was in the middle of a period of intense upheaval. HSBC was slimming down its investment bank, selling poorly performing businesses and slashing thousands of jobs as it tried to adapt to the post-financial-crisis era. While Tucker was well equipped to guide the lender through that period of turmoil, he must now wrestle with a far bigger existential question - should the bank be broken up?  He has form on handling such decisions: as head of insurer Prudential in the late 2000s, he withstood calls for splitting the weaker UK business away from its more lucrative Asian operations, which made up more than half of profits from new business. Yet his resistance there ultimately proved futile. Prudential eventually did split - albeit nearly a decade after Tucker's departure. A similar dilemma now faces him at HSBC, after its largest investor, the Chinese insurance group Ping An, revived calls to separate the bank's profitable Asian business from the rest of the lender's operations. HSBC's Scottish founder, Sir Thomas Sutherland, envisioned a Hong Kong-based lender that would finance trade between Europe and Asia when he launched the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1865. But the bank's successes have largely mirrored the rise of globalisation, having splashed cash on a string of acquisitions since the 1970s - including Britain's Midland Bank in 1992 - as international business boomed. By the 2008 financial crisis - by which time HSBC had a presence in 86 countries and had long since shifted its headquarters to London - the bank's traditional home markets still accounted for most of its profits. 'It was strange situation in which the bank was making most of its money in territories it had originally been in before the global push abroad,' said David Kynaston, the historian and author of The Lion Wakes: A Modern History of HSBC. Subsequent shareholder pressure to capitalise on its strengths meant backtracking on some of those projects. Before publicly pushing for a breakup, Ping An had privately called for HSBC to get out of money-draining assets in the west, refocus on Asia, and embark on a cost-cutting scheme to trim excesses. 'Over the last 15 years or so, there's been quite a significant rowing back,' Kynaston said, noting HSBC's recent decision to ditch its retail banks in the US and France, and the shrinking of its footprint from 86 to 64 countries since the financial crisis. The financial arguments for pruning its global network have since been amplified into debate over a breakup. Ping An has expressed disappointment at the return on its investment, having seen the dividend cancelled during the first UK lockdown, and reinstated at only half the level seen before the pandemic. Some have suggested that any shareholder vote on a split of HSBC's Asian and western operations would also be a referendum on the bank's strategy under Tucker, a former trainee professional footballer and diehard Chelsea FC fan. Tucker clashed with, and had a hand in ousting, chief executive John Flint, who had been in post less than two years, in August 2019, before triggering a more ambitious cost-cutting agenda - involving about 35,000 job losses - under Flint's replacement, Noel Quinn. Ping An's calls for a split have added fuel to an already burning fire. HSBC's role straddling east and west has been eroded by an increasingly polarised political climate and a wave of protectionism that was turbocharged by Donald Trump's trade war with China and has gained further traction during the pandemic. Most notably, HSBC has struggled to navigate pressures from Washington and London on one side, and Beijing on the other, after the bank controversially accepted China's authoritarian crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong in 2020. Meanwhile, the fact that UK and US regulators have a hold over HSBC even though it makes most of its profits in Asia has ruffled feathers across its investor base. HSBC's leadership has consistently defended itself against political pressure to take a side in the crackdown in Hong Kong, and internally there is support for the bank's position, with some believing its single biggest advantage is in providing a platform for navigating such geopolitics, and ultimately allowing money to flow across borders regardless of regimes. Rowing back on its international ambitions would also have severe consequences beyond the bank's balance sheet. About 9% of funds linked to global trade run through its infrastructure, and a breakup would add further friction at a time when the world is still recovering from the pandemic, feeling the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine, and wrestling with rising inflation that has put pressure on supply chains. 'HSBC supports customers, corporates and institutions across key capital and trade hubs around the world,' the bank said in a statement. 'This network manifests itself in our leading global franchises across retail, wealth and wholesale banking. The most important thing for management to focus on is continuing to drive higher returns, as we have done very successfully, despite the disruptions of Covid-19.' Geopolitics and trade aside, British politicians also have a financial interest in keeping HSBC together. The Treasury will be acutely aware of the potential losses associated with a breakup: while hiving off HSBC's Asia operations would probably leave the UK retail bank intact, the exchequer's earnings through the UK bank levy would plunge. The banking sector surcharge, first imposed by former chancellor George Osborne in the wake of the financial crisis, taxes UK-headquartered banks on their global balance sheets rather than their local operations, ensuring that global lenders such as Standard Chartered and HSBC contribute more heavily to the British public purse. In 2019, HSBC paid an extra $988m (PS800m) to the Treasury as a result of the bank levy, more than six times the $154m it paid that year in UK corporation tax. The current chancellor, Rishi Sunak, may have been taken that income for granted when he announced plans to slash the bank levy from 8% to 3% from 2023. The Treasury declined to comment, saying any decision was a commercial matter for HSBC. However, it is the UK's grip on HSBC's finances that seems to have fuelled Ping An's calls for a split. Ping An - which is China's most valuable publicly listed insurer - first declared a 5% stake in the lender in December 2017, at a time when HSBC's shares were trading at 706p on average, and the bank was paying 51 cents a share in dividends. The investment was strategic for Ping An, which took on the shareholding through a life insurance arm that relies on dividend income to offset long-term liabilities. But by 2020, the world had changed. With regulators fearing the worst in the early days of the pandemic, UK banks reached an agreement with the Bank of England to scrap nearly PS8bn in dividends, ensuring that lenders had a strong enough capital cushion for whatever economic blows might ensue. The announcement, which meant HSBC would have to backtrack on promises to pay $4.2bn to shareholders, disturbed investors and reignited debates about HSBC's structure: a less lucrative European jurisdiction had been able to dictate major financial decisions to a bank that drew about two-thirds of its profits from a different continent entirely. But Ping An hung on. In September 2020, it gave HSBC a vote of confidence when it raised its stake to 8% and become its largest shareholder - right in the middle of the political row over the bank's support for China's controversial security law being extended to Hong Kong. The resulting calm was shortlived. Ping An faced further frustration when HSBC reinstated its dividend at just half the previous rate after the Bank of England lifted restrictions last year. HSBC executives met their largest shareholder regularly in the months that followed, though discussions turned tense at the turn of the new year. It is understood that they felt blindsided by Ping An's call for a breakup, having never been given official notice that the investor was calling for an outright split. It has been suggested that Ping An's decision to air its grievances via the press is a result of pressures over its own faltering fortunes. On the same day its breakup demands went public, it reported a 24% drop in first-quarter profits to 20.6bn yuan (PS2.5bn), which it blamed on market volatility. It also warned that the ongoing effects of the pandemic were creating a more 'complex, severe, and uncertain' environment for its global business. Some have also speculated that the insurance arm may be considering selling its stake in HSBC to release some cash and find a more lucrative home for its investment. In the meantime, HSBC's executives are expected to hold their ground when they speak with the insurer later this month. HSBC said: 'We believe we've got the right strategy and are focused on executing it. Delivering on this strategy is the fastest way to generate higher returns and maximise shareholder value.' Yet while Tucker may be able to douse this fire, the debate over HSBC's future is not going away.", "d9cc32cedadb3f2d9c2abb5b81c42a3683e0c0d8ac547752f1a9b769": "At least 26 people have been killed and a further 74 have been treated in hospital after a powerful explosion tore the facade from a hotel in the Cuban capital, sending plumes of dust into the air and leaving rubble strewn across the street in the historic centre of Havana. Speaking at the scene soon afterwards, the Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, ruled out a bomb and said the blast at the Hotel Saratoga appeared to have been caused by a gas leak. 'In no case was it a bomb or an attack,' he later told Reuters as he left the capital's Calixto Garcia hospital, where many of the injured were treated. 'It's just a very unfortunate accident.' The hotel was closed to tourists at the time of the explosion, but workers were inside. State TV reported search and rescue efforts were ongoing and said it was unclear whether additional victims remained trapped in the rubble. Photos published by government news media showed much of the hotel's outer wall blown away, exposing interior rooms, with clouds of dust billowing into the sky. Roberto Enrique Calzadilla, a representative of the military-run company that operates many of the country's hotels, said the 96-room hotel had been set to reopen in the next few days and that the workers on site were making final preparations. 'The workers were ... making repairs and doing all the work to open the property and in the morning they were resupplying the gas and it seems some accident caused an explosion,' he said on state television. Police and rescue workers flocked to the scene, cordoning off areas and buildings nearby, including the Capitolio building. Windows in the surrounding streets were blown out by the force of the explosion, and two hours after the explosion, an acrid smell lingered in the air. 'I was walking past when everything went white and I couldn't see anything,' said one woman who lives just a block from the hotel. Habaneros living in the colonial part of the city are accustomed to the sudden collapse of once-elegant buildings, which are often home to dozens of families but have received little maintenance for decades. But the thunderous noise the explosion made was something different: within 15 minutes of the explosion, more than 10,000 people had congregated outside the rubble-strewn structure, taking pictures and uploading videos. Yazira de la Caridad, mother of two, told AP that the explosion shook her home a block from the hotel. 'The whole building moved. I thought it was an earthquake,' she said. 'I've still got my heart in my hand.' The disaster was yet another blow to the island's struggling tourism industry, which the government relies on for hard currency but has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic and tighter US sanctions. 'It means that less tourists will come because of fear,' said Jiskli Aguila, 51, who works in a furniture factory, and was watching TV two blocks away when the explosion happened. 'And with the problems in the economy and the state of the country - it's just one thing after another.' The 96-room neo-classical-style hotel was remodeled by a British company after the fall of the Soviet Union and was considered the place to go for visiting government officials and celebrities for many years. Madonna and Beyonce have both stayed at the five-star hotel, although recently it had lost some of its shine with the opening of new hotels in Havana. The hotel had been set for a post-pandemic reopening in four days, according to its Facebook page.", "0b6b2811398f7630bc7c4b5b955e6b62b77c699e261da8629a363e6a": "In the half light of the approaching sunrise at Maroubra in Sydney's south-east, Joshua Hay clambers over rock ledges, feeling his way to the ocean's edge. Armed with his 1970s vintage rod, reel and bucket, he's aiming to catch luderick at 'the Stake', a popular but dangerous spot among rock fishers. To get to the Stake 'fishos' have to pass a sign reading 'three deaths' underneath a skull and crossbones - the tally of drownings in the area. Rain has been sprinkling down on the coastline overnight, and the rocks are wet and slippery. As Hay digs around for bits of seaweed - his preferred bait - foamy water laps at his ankles. 'You still get those butterflies,' he says with a grin. 'That's why they call it fishing, not catching.' The Stake is in the city of Randwick, where there have been 21 rock fishing fatalities since 2001 - making it the most statistically dangerous area for the sport in Australia. Rock fishing is the second-most common cause of drowning along the New South Wales coastline behind swimming. Despite its dangers, more than 1.2 million Australians go rock fishing every year, including a diverse group of migrants. Lin Yuan learned the art of rock fishing from 'Master Han', an experienced fisher who frequents Bare Island at La Perouse. 'My friend sent me a photo of him, and said, 'that guy always catches good fish',' he says. Nowadays, Yuan, Han and his friend head out when it's still pitch black about 5am, armed with a large net to keep caught fish and squid alive until they assess their haul at the end of the day. The smaller fish, or the less tasty, are returned to the sea. 'Around Sydney, there's not many secret spots anymore ... and you don't want to risk too much danger. It's a hobby, not what you do for a living,' Yuan says with a laugh. Yuan and his mates all wear life jackets and cleats. They have seen the dangers first-hand after watching a fisher get washed away at another La Perouse spot. 'Luckily his friend had a fishing rod, [and] he took off the hooks so they could grab the line and slowly fished him back in,' Yuan says. 'After he got out, everyone was still fishing, even himself.' Joint research by Surf Life Saving Australia and the University of Melbourne found that a misunderstanding of wave patterns among inexperienced fishers has led to the notion of 'freak' wave events. Study author David Kennedy said the notion of 'lone waves ... grabbing people out of nowhere' was a myth. 'Less experienced fishers [surveyed] tended to look closer at the base of where the waves were about to hit,' he said. 'People had seconds, at best, of warning when a wave was coming, whereas more experienced fishers were already looking offshore.' NSW councils have implemented a range of measures to reduce the risk of rock fishing, including mandating life jackets, increasing signage and running educational workshops. Randwick was the first council to make lifejackets compulsory in 2016. But a study released by the council the following year found their use had only slightly increased. Almost half of respondents to a council survey didn't think the use of lifejackets was necessary despite a majority being aware that there was a high death toll in the area. While Kennedy agreed rock fishing was 'inherently dangerous', he said risk would be substantially minimised with greater education and awareness of surroundings. 'You're in a remote environment and that's why people are doing it. You're in nature, and it's recognition [that] nature's boss,' he said. 'The element of danger is part of the excitement. 'Often the decision to go fishing is made when someone leaves home ... Once they've got down there, travelled a long way, it's a bigger call to not fish. People will put themselves into situations they might not have.' Central Coast fisher James Cross says when people tell him rock fishing is dangerous, he replies: 'It is, but no more dangerous than swimming.' This year has already been marred by a number of deaths, including a father and son who were washed off the rocks at Little Bay just down the coast from Maroubra in January. Fishers, including Cross, said La Nina had contributed to unfavourable conditions. Cross uses a canister lifejacket that can be inflated if needed, believing that being a strong swimmer, an inflated jacket may hinder his chances of returning to shore. 'I know a lot of people who've been washed off the rocks and they know a place to swim back in ... I fancy my odds, I wouldn't be out if it was wild,' he says. Cross has been hooked on rock fishing ever since his father-in-law came home with a bag of luderick and drummer for dinner. He has introduced several other people to the sport. 'People have gone, 'where do you keep getting this fish from?' because if I've forgotten a bucket I'll tie a net on the front of the car,' he says. 'It's a good conversation starter.' Cross gravitated to rock fishing for several reasons: foraging, environmental preservation and the adrenaline rush that comes with an unexpected catch. Then there's the 'therapeutic, meditative qualities of it'. 'One of the best times is the morning,' he says. 'You get up with head torches, watch the sun rise over the ocean ... Combine that with a sport you love, you're getting a bite and then you come home and have a coffee and breakfast and feel like the day is just starting.' Plus, the members of the community have each other's back. That's what Cross loves most. 'Going out and having a chat with the boys on the rocks ... You can sit down with someone you'd never have talked to and have a good yarn about the fish that got away,' he says. 'It brings out the best in people.' For Hay, fishing isn't just a hobby - it's in his bloodline. 'I've fished my whole life, my grandfather fished, my dad fished,' he says. 'There've been days with three of us when we've caught 30 fish in three hours, but some of the days I like most, I've gone way out, found a new ledge in the middle of nowhere, no one else is there, and I've caught fish. 'Or days fish are really hard to catch. You try two, three hours, and finally catch one. It's as satisfying as catching 10.'", "2fb3bbfd916cabd9d8cd8ace585103d6035d95e420cca6c610b3d26f": "", "cbf2b7fc176534a141b75e9c2f214c1996d3252eed44c035214f34f9": "", "bd3b98a9fc5c89e5e5036fe1e0b346d242cff6d8465472f98214e17e": "", "4d6a09848abaeb435310c9fcbb39fc5a0d81b49fe670a8f721f63e6e": "", "2c735449f436e4ca70a67967fc6832df14a450be8fbb5869faf19e15": "", "9c23bb7802d6a4a86eb25453dce84f673a90a702f2d662e6208fb464": "", "768e8b27902fef4d72a5187c30506ef0c39da868d1d312ed5ed65c56": "", "06c9b44bd76c6b0e314ab608cde4347e1ff6f83d4fb6fe23417ea290": "", "634a7ba8465ee5e5f738e844d8349ef552ae3b150627e7ab16bed38c": "", "4cc6c3a2a20e4235bcbcac12554c945c4b66adda5d201d55712b5827": "Maggie Mayhem knows when she decided to become a reproductive rights activist. At around 13 she discovered two conditions in her southern California Catholic girls school's manual: If a student was found to have had an abortion, they would be expelled, because abortion was against the teaching of the Catholic church. At the same time, the school would not accommodate a student who became pregnant. 'It taught me my reproductive system was something I should be afraid of, that it could have negative consequences for my life,' Mayhem says. 'I saw: 'there will be no sympathy for you. And anyone that you talk to about this poses a risk.'' She also saw beautiful things: friends helping friends to the abortion clinic. Teenagers taking care of teenagers, keeping grownups at bay. That solidarity led her to her current line of work. Mayhem - a pseudonym - is just one of many US activists vouching for self-managed abortions outside the gaze of the medical establishment. With a growing slate of abortion restrictions and the recent leak of a supreme court draft opinion indicating justices have already voted to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, activists like Mayhem say such measures aren't just necessary, they are also better than what's currently on offer. They are saying: abortion is your right - and you don't need to depend on doctors or the state for it. When most people think of self-managed abortion, they think of back alleys, coat hangers or throwing oneself down the stairs; of last resorts, despair, shame. But that is no longer the reality. Today, self-managed abortion often means taking pills that are available over the counter in many countries, with little risk of death or serious complications. Other times, it means using herbs, or vacuum aspirators, like the Del-Em (a homemade suction device created by activists in the 70s), under the watchful eye of somebody experienced - like a midwife or a doula - who can advise if things go wrong. Self-managed abortion is not a silver bullet. It carries with it the risk of prosecution, even though it is not illegal in most states. In April, a Texas woman was charged with murder for a self-induced abortion, even though there was no legal basis for the charges - as the district attorney admitted when he dropped the case. And not everybody wants to turn to a clandestine market for their abortion care. Some people feel more comfortable with a licensed practitioner. People want options. But for many,  options are fast receding. Those who look outside the medical establishment will find, often through word of mouth, an underground movement of doctors, midwives, doulas and activists - some trained by formal institutions, others by practitioners in the network. They will find those who mostly undertake legal work - sharing information from the World Health Organization about how to use medication to induce an abortion, for example. They'll also find some who do not - assisting with abortions later down the line, or giving medical advice when things go wrong. 'It is not a practitioner's or a government's job to give people power,' says Samantha Zipporah, an educator who refers to herself as a traditional midwife - Zipporah is not credentialed. Zipporah says she rejects state regulation of pregnancy care. To her, home-centered abortion care is far from a last resort or a reaction to a changing policy landscape. It's simply not something that should be dependent on an outside authority.'Throughout history, we have a much greater tradition of our fertility and reproductive capacities being social, spiritual and ecological rather than medical or political,' she explains. 'The medical-industrial paradigm, the church, the state - these institutions are set up in a way that requires obedience and submission,' she says. 'Our power was never theirs. Our bodies have power.' The advent of medication abortion has made the work of these activists easier - because it is easily available. Medication abortion is safer than Tylenol - resulting in a successful termination 99.6% of the time when used appropriately, with less than a 1% risk of complications, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The safety of other means used outside a clinical setting hasn't been sufficiently studied, but broadly speaking, existing data from recent years does not show elevated fatality rates from self-managed abortion. The FDA recently allowed people to receive abortion pills by mail, without needing to first visit a medical facility. But states seeking to restrict abortion have required in-person visits or have banned abortion telehealth services outright. That's just one reason activists want to cut out the middle man. Although the majority of abortions are completed with medication, only 21% of the US public know these pills exist. People can order them online but scam sites are common. So activists use in-person and virtual grassroots networks to share where to buy the pills, how to safely ingest them, what a normal response to them looks like and when to seek help. Crucially, they can explain the legal landscape - after all, if you turn up at the emergency room admitting you tried to cause your own abortion, you could face legal risk. But because medication abortion and complications from it look exactly the same, medically, as a miscarriage - people need not disclose they tried to induce their own abortion. Self-managed abortion can eradicate barriers, even in a world where in-clinic abortions aren't under attack. It offers privacy: the ability to have an abortion at home, away from protesters, or your community. It may offer cover from an abusive partner. And it means that people who live far away from a clinic, or can't afford to make the trip, can still access the procedure. 'It all comes down to someone assessing their own situation, and being able to make a decision about how to manage their reproductive care. There's simply no medical reason that abortion pills shouldn't be over the counter,' says a spokesperson for Mountain Access Brigade, a group that runs an abortion hotline in Appalachia and the south-east. 'To make people jump through these hoops: to go to appointments, to have a mandatory ultrasound - these things are designed to humiliate, shame and coerce them into changing their mind,' she adds. 'These pills are safer than aspirin. They're safer than Viagra. We let people manage very complex conditions at home - such as diabetes. And yet these pills are so restricted,' says reproductive rights activist Susan Yanow. 'People are afraid of them.' Of course, some doctors worry about self-managed abortions. The abortion pill is considered safe only until 10 weeks. People can still use it effectively up to 14 weeks, but the risk of complications goes up. Doctors worry about people estimating the wrong date of conception; that they may still be pregnant after taking the medication without realizing; or they will experience complications and end up in need of urgent help. 'I absolutely worry about people self-managing their abortions,' says Dr Mark Rosing, an obstetrician gynecologist who works in the Bronx, New York. 'A patient could hemorrhage, develop a severe infection and even die,' he adds. Rosing was in training in New York in the early 2000s, when he noticed patients in the emergency room talking about taking a 'star pill' before miscarriage. They were referring to misoprostol, one of the drugs used to induce a medical abortion, which was not widely available for abortion uses then. He presumes many people used the medication successfully and didn't end up in the emergency room. But those who did were panicked, scared of how much they were bleeding and sometimes hadn't successfully evacuated the pregnancy. He understands that in a landscape that looks increasingly likely to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, leading to bans in 26 states, people might not have a choice. 'I wouldn't blame them. People aren't going to stop trying to get what they need,' he says. Rosing was trained by many doctors who practiced before Roe v Wade, the seminal supreme court decision which established the constitutional right to abortion. His mentors and teachers told him about cases involving self-managed abortion, and the gruesome complications which haunted them. 'People came in with perforated uteruses, hemorrhage and severe infections. People lost their uterus and all kinds of things,' he says. 'I'm really afraid we're going back there.' The reality is that self-managed abortions don't look the same now as pre-Roe. There were 19 deaths related to 'illegal' abortions - those not performed by a licensed clinician - in 1973, the year Roe v Wade was decided, according to CDC data. In the last two decades, two people have died from an illegal abortion, while 103 have died from a legal abortion. The comparison is not like-for-like - hundreds of thousands of legal abortions take place every year in the US, whereas the full scale of self-managed abortion is unknown - but the dangers of self-managed abortion may be overstated. 'We are more capable of being able to understand our reproductive selves - and to manage that effectively and safely - than we've been led to believe,' says Vienna Farlow, a holistic healthcare practitioner. 'But the system is set up to say, you're too dumb to do any of this. And not only are you too dumb, your body doesn't matter enough for us to even care to tell you how to do it,' she expands. Activists believe much of the stigma around self-managed abortion was caused, in part, by a campaigning technique by the pro-choice movement - when abortion activists would hand out small coat hangers, defending the right to abortion by evoking images of dangerous procedures that are no longer the norm. 'That may have been very necessary or appropriate for the time, but it increased the fear of abortion and added a lot more abstract ideas of danger rather than demystifying what abortion is,' Mayhem says. Between 2017 and 2020, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, tried to understand the prevalence, effectiveness and dangers of self-managed abortions - the first ever such study to do so. They asked a random sample of 7,022 women if they had self-managed an abortion in their lifetime and 1.4% responded that they had, leading researchers to predict that something like 7% of all women in the US will self-manage an abortion in their lifetime. The researchers were surprised by the methods women use to induce their own abortions - booze, herbs, pills, even asking a partner to hit them in the abdomen. They thought medication abortion would be more prevalent. These methods were largely ineffective, but also largely not life-threatening. Of 92 participants who said they had tried to manage their own abortions, 27 were effective. Twelve said they experienced complications (defined as something requiring 'treatment by a doctor or nurse'). Nobody experienced severe complications. For one in five participants, not being able to locate an abortion clinic, or having to travel too far to get to one, was the reason the person attempted self-management. Forebodingly, the researchers pointed out: 'Unprecedented levels of new state-level abortion restrictions ... and the potential for a Supreme Court decision that could reshape federal Constitutional protections on abortion, suggest an urgent need to pay close attention to trends in [self-managed abortion] ... in the coming years.' While fears over medical difficulties abound when discussing self-managed abortion, incarceration is the bigger threat in the US. At least 17 people have been arrested in the US for charges connected to self-induced abortion. They include Jennifer Whalen, who served jail time for buying pills online for her 16-year-old daughter to have an abortion, after they couldn't access an appointment at a clinic. Some, like Purvi Patel in Indiana and Regina McKnight in South Carolina, were given decades-long sentences. Both were overturned, but not before each spent years in jail. But what are the risks of not getting an abortion? First, a lot more people will die during childbirth - which is 14 times more deadly than abortion. 'Abortion is a very safe procedure. And in the United States, staying pregnant is relatively deadly, because we have such an abysmal rate of pregnancy-related mortality and morbidity,' explains Dr Amanda Stevenson, who conducted research predicting how many more people will die if Roe v Wade is overturned solely because of the greater mortality risk of continuing a pregnancy. Her study found that, in the event of a nationwide abortion ban, pregnancy-related deaths would increase by 21% within two years. The numbers would be worst for racial minorities. Black people would experience the greatest rate of increase in deaths (33%), followed by Hispanic people (18%). Denying women access to abortion also increases their chances of life-threatening complications, financial hardship and prolonged domestic violence. But if more people know how to manage their own abortions, risks would be reduced, surmises Dr Stevenson. 'If the alternative is self-managed abortion, and that's because clinic-based care isn't accessible, then that's a whole lot safer than staying pregnant,' she says. Another midwife, who supports abortions outside a clinical context, points out the dangers associated with in-clinic abortions. She says she has supported people who have gone for an abortion in-clinic, and then found themselves with complications - like hemorrhage, or incomplete removal - who did not want to go back to the doctor. 'There's so many people that are sent home with pills, without any education about what [their experience should look like],' says the midwife, who did not want to be identified for legal reasons. 'I have supported people who have had incomplete abortions, and needed to go back to the clinic for a repeat suction a number of times, or have had infections and retained tissues, who did not go back to the clinic because the clinic was abusive ... because the clinical care was so impersonal,' she says. As Zipporah puts it, it's not about placing one treatment over the other, it's about giving people a choice. 'I am not demonizing medical care providers or medical care. I don't think that abortion should be only always in the clinic with a doctor or only always at home with a midwife. I believe that people need to have the education and support to do whatever the fuck they want. And to realize that they have options,' says Zipporah.", "fb906ed282d17dd156573d32f722bf2261df6e4e82313fe8846f7722": "Beneath our feet is an ecosystem so astonishing that it tests the limits of our imagination. It's as diverse as a rainforest or a coral reef. We depend on it for 99% of our food, yet we scarcely know it. Soil. Under one square metre of undisturbed ground in the Earth's mid-latitudes (which include the UK) there might live several hundred thousand small animals. Roughly 90% of the species to which they belong have yet to be named. One gram of this soil - less than a teaspoonful - contains around a kilometre of fungal filaments. When I first examined a lump of soil with a powerful lens, I could scarcely believe what I was seeing. As soon as I found the focal length, it burst into life. I immediately saw springtails - tiny animals similar to insects - in dozens of shapes and sizes. Round, crabby mites were everywhere: in some soils there are half a million in every square metre. Then I began to see creatures I had never encountered before. What I took to be a tiny white centipede turned out, when I looked it up, to be a different life form altogether, called a symphylid. I spotted something that might have stepped out of a Japanese anime: long and low, with two fine antennae at the front and two at the back, poised and sprung like a virile dragon or a flying horse. It was a bristletail, or dipluran. As I worked my way through the lump, again and again I found animals whose existence, despite my degree in zoology and a lifetime immersed in natural history, had been unknown to me. After two hours examining a kilogram of soil, I realised I had seen more of the major branches of the animal kingdom than I would on a week's safari in the Serengeti. But even more arresting than soil's diversity and abundance is the question of what it actually is. Most people see it as a dull mass of ground-up rock and dead plants. But it turns out to be a biological structure, built by living creatures to secure their survival, like a wasps' nest or a beaver dam. Microbes make cements out of carbon, with which they stick mineral particles together, creating pores and passages through which water, oxygen and nutrients pass. The tiny clumps they build become the blocks the animals in the soil use to construct bigger labyrinths. Soil is fractally scaled, which means its structure is consistent, regardless of magnification. Bacteria, fungi, plants and soil animals, working unconsciously together, build an immeasurably intricate, endlessly ramifying architecture that, like Dust in a Philip Pullman novel, organises itself spontaneously into coherent worlds. This biological structure helps to explain soil's resistance to droughts and floods: if it were just a heap of matter, it would be swept away. It also reveals why soil can break down so quickly when it's farmed. Under certain conditions, when farmers apply nitrogen fertiliser, the microbes respond by burning through the carbon: in other words, the cement that holds their catacombs together. The pores cave in. The passages collapse. The soil becomes sodden, airless and compacted. But none of the above captures the true wonder of soil. Let's start with something that flips our understanding of how we survive. Plants release into the soil between 11% and 40% of all the sugars they make through photosynthesis. They don't leak them accidentally. They deliberately pump them into the ground. Stranger still, before releasing them, they turn some of these sugars into compounds of tremendous complexity. Making such chemicals requires energy and resources, so this looks like pouring money down the drain. Why do they do it? The answer unlocks the gate to a secret garden. These complex chemicals are pumped into the zone immediately surrounding the plant's roots, which is called the rhizosphere. They are released to create and manage its relationships. Soil is full of bacteria. Its earthy scent is the smell of the compounds they produce. In most corners, most of the time, they wait, in suspended animation, for the messages that will wake them. These messages are the chemicals the plant releases. They are so complex because the plant seeks not to alert bacteria in general, but the particular bacteria that promote its growth. Plants use a sophisticated chemical language that only the microbes to whom they wish to speak can understand. When a plant root pushes into a lump of soil and starts releasing its messages, it triggers an explosion of activity. The bacteria responding to its call consume the sugars the plant feeds them and proliferate to form some of the densest microbial communities on Earth. There can be a billion bacteria in a single gram of the rhizosphere; they unlock the nutrients on which the plant depends and produce growth hormones and other chemicals that help it grow. The plant's vocabulary changes from place to place and time to time, depending on what it needs. If it's starved of certain nutrients, or the soil is too dry or salty, it calls out to the bacteria species that can help. Take a step back and you will see something that transforms our understanding of life on Earth. The rhizosphere lies outside the plant, but it functions as if it were part of the whole. It could be seen as the plant's external gut. The similarities between the rhizosphere and the human gut, where bacteria also live in astonishing numbers, are uncanny. In both systems, microbes break down organic material into the simpler compounds the plant or person can absorb. Though there are more than 1,000 phyla (major groups) of bacteria, the same four dominate both the rhizosphere and the guts of mammals. Just as human breast milk contains sugars called oligosaccharides, whose purpose is to feed not the baby but the bacteria in the baby's gut, young plants release large quantities of sucrose into the soil, to feed and develop their new microbiomes. Just as the bacteria that live in our guts outcompete and attack invading pathogens, the friendly microbes in the rhizosphere create a defensive ring around the root. Just as bacteria in the colon educate our immune cells and send chemical messages that trigger our body's defensive systems, the plant's immune system is trained and primed by bacteria in the rhizosphere. Soil might not be as beautiful to the eye as a rainforest or a coral reef, but once you begin to understand it, it is as beautiful to the mind. Upon this understanding our survival might hang. We face what could be the greatest predicament humankind has ever encountered: feeding the world without devouring the planet. Already, farming is the world's greatest cause of habitat destruction, the greatest cause of the global loss of wildlife and the greatest cause of the global extinction crisis. It's responsible for about 80% of the deforestation that's happened this century. Of 28,000 species known to be at imminent risk of extinction, 24,000 are threatened by farming. Only 29% of the weight of birds on Earth consists of wild species: the rest is poultry. Just 4% of the world's mammals, by weight, are wild; humans account for 36%, and livestock for the remaining 60%. Unless something changes, all this is likely to get worse - much worse. In principle, there is plenty of food, even for a rising population. But roughly half the calories farmers grow are now fed to livestock, and the demand for animal products is rising fast. Without a radical change in the way we eat, by 2050 the world will need to grow around 50% more grain. How could we do it without wiping out much of the rest of life on Earth? Just as farming is trashing crucial Earth systems, their destruction threatens our food supply. Sustaining even current levels of production might prove impossible. Climate breakdown is likely, on the whole, to make wet places wetter and dry places drier. One more degree of heating, one estimate suggests, would parch 32% of the world's land surface. By the middle of this century, severe droughts could simultaneously affect an arc from Portugal to Pakistan. And this is before we consider the rising economic fragility of the global food system, or geopolitical pressures, such as the current war in Ukraine, that might threaten 30% of the world's wheat exports. It's not just the quantity of production that's at risk, but also its quality. A combination of higher temperatures and higher concentrations of CO2 reduces the level of minerals, protein and B vitamins that crops contain. Already, zinc deficiency alone afflicts more than a billion people. Though we seldom discuss it, one paper describes the falling concentrations of nutrients as 'existential threats'. Some crop scientists believe we can counter these trends by raising yields in places that remain productive. But their hopes rely on unrealistic assumptions. The most important of these is sufficient water. The anticipated growth in crop yields would require 146% more fresh water than is used today. Just one problem: that water doesn't exist. Over the past 100 years, our use of water has increased six-fold. Irrigating crops consumes 70% of the water we withdraw from rivers, lakes and aquifers. Already, 4 billion people suffer from water scarcity for at least one month a year and 33 major cities, including Sao Paulo, Cape Town, Los Angeles and Chennai, are threatened by extreme water stress. As groundwater is depleted, farmers have begun to rely more heavily on meltwater from glaciers and snowpacks. But these, too, are shrinking. A likely flashpoint is the valley of the Indus, whose water is used by three nuclear powers (India, Pakistan and China) and several unstable regions. Already, 95% of the river's flow is extracted. As the economy and the population grow, by 2025 demand for water in the catchment is expected to be 44% greater than supply. But one of the reasons why farming there has been able to intensify and cities to grow is that, as a result of global heating, glaciers in the Hindu Kush and the Himalayas have been melting faster than they've been accumulating, so more water has been flowing down the rivers. This can't last. By the end of the century, between one- and two-thirds of the ice mass is likely to have disappeared. It is hard to see this ending well. And all this is before we come to the soil, the thin cushion between rock and air on which human life depends, which we treat like dirt. While there are international treaties on telecommunication, civil aviation, investment guarantees, intellectual property, psychotropic substances and doping in sport, there is no global treaty on soil. The notion that this complex and scarcely understood system can withstand all we throw at it and continue to support us could be the most dangerous of all our beliefs. Soil degradation is bad enough in rich nations, where the ground is often left bare and exposed to winter rain, compacted and wrecked by overfertilisation and pesticides that rip through its foodwebs. But it tends to be even worse in poorer nations, partly because extreme rainfall, cyclones and hurricanes can tear bare earth from the land, and partly because hungry people are often driven to cultivate steep slopes. In some countries, mostly in Central America, tropical Africa and south-east Asia, more than 70% of the arable land is now suffering severe erosion, gravely threatening future production. Climate breakdown, which will cause more intense droughts and storms, exacerbates the threat. The loss of a soil's resilience can happen incrementally and subtly. We might scarcely detect it until a shock pushes the complex underground system past its tipping point. When severe drought strikes, the erosion rate of degraded soil can rise 6,000-fold. In other words, the soil collapses. Fertile lands turn to dustbowls. Some people have responded to these threats by calling for the relocalisation and de-intensification of farming. I understand their concerns. But their vision is mathematically impossible. A study in the journal Nature Food found the average minimum distance at which the world's people can be fed is 2,200km. In other words, this is the shortest possible average journey that our food must travel if we are not to starve. For those who depend on wheat and similar cereals, it's 3,800km. A quarter of the global population that consumes these crops needs food grown at least 5,200km away. Why? Because most of the world's people live in big cities or populous valleys, whose hinterland is too small (and often too dry, hot or cold) to feed them. Much of the world's food has to be grown in vast, lightly habited lands - the Canadian prairies, the US plains, wide tracts in Russia and Ukraine, the Brazilian interior - and shipped to tight, densely populated places.  As for reducing the intensity of farming, what this means is using more land to produce the same amount of food. Land use is arguably the most important of all environmental issues. The more land farming occupies, the less is available for forests and wetlands, savannahs and wild grasslands, and the greater is the loss of wildlife and the rate of extinction. All farming, however kind and careful, involves a radical simplification of natural ecosystems. Environmental campaigners rail against urban sprawl: the profligate use of land for housing and infrastructure. But agricultural sprawl - using large amounts of land to produce small amounts of food - has transformed much greater areas. While 1% of the world's land is used for buildings and infrastructure, crops occupy 12% and grazing, the most extensive kind of farming, uses 28%. Only 15% of land, by contrast, is protected for nature. Yet the meat and milk from animals that rely solely on grazing provide just 1% of the world's protein. One paper looked at what would happen if everyone in the US followed the advice of celebrity chefs and switched from grain-fed to pasture-fed beef. It found that, because they grow more slowly on grass, the number of cattle would have to rise by 30%, while the land area used to feed them would rise by 270%. Even if the US felled all its forests, drained its wetlands, watered its deserts and annulled its national parks, it would still need to import most of its beef. Already, much of the beef the US buys comes from Brazil, which in 2018 became the world's largest exporter. This meat is often promoted as 'pasture-fed'. Many of the pastures were created by illegally clearing the rainforest. Worldwide, meat production could destroy 3m sq km of highly biodiverse places in 35 years. That's almost the size of India. Only when livestock are extremely sparse is animal farming compatible with rich, functional ecosystems. For example, the Knepp Wildland project in West Sussex, where small herds of cattle and pigs roam freely across a large estate, is often cited as a way to reconcile meat and wildlife. But while it's an excellent example of rewilding, it's a terrible example of food production. If this system were to be rolled out across 10% of the UK's farmland and if, as its champions propose, we obtained our meat this way, it would furnish each person here with 420 grams of meat a year, enough for around three meals. We could eat a prime steak roughly once every three years. If all the farmland in the UK were to be managed this way, it would provide us with 75kcal a day (one 30th of our requirement) in meat, and nothing else. Of course, this is not how it would be distributed. The very rich would eat meat every week, other people not at all. Those who say we should buy only meat like this, who often use the slogan 'less and better', present an exclusive product as if it were available to everyone. Campaigners, chefs and food writers rail against intensive farming and the harm it does to us and the world. But the problem is not the adjective: it's the noun. The destruction of Earth systems is caused not by intensive farming or extensive farming, but a disastrous combination of the two. So what can we do? Part of the answer is to take as much food production out of farming as we can. As luck would have it, the enabling technology has arrived just as we need it. Precision fermentation, producing protein and fat in breweries from soil bacteria, fed on water, hydrogen, CO2 and minerals, has the potential to replace all livestock farming, all soya farming and plenty of vegetable oil production, while massively reducing land use and other environmental impacts. But this remarkable good fortune is threatened by intellectual property rights: it could easily be captured by the same corporations that now monopolise the global grain and meat trade. We should fiercely resist this: patents should be weak and anti-trust laws strong. Ideally, this farm-free food should be open source. Then we could relocalise production: the new fermentation technologies could be used by local businesses to serve local markets. As some of the world's poorest nations are rich in sunlight, they could make good use of a technology that relies on green hydrogen. Microbial production horrifies some of those who demand food sovereignty and food justice. But it could deliver both more effectively than farming does. Such technologies grant us, for the first time since the Neolithic period, the opportunity to transform not only our food system but our entire relationship with the living world. Vast tracts of land can be released from both intensive and extensive farming. The age of extinction could be replaced by an age of regenesis. Of course, we would still need to produce cereals, roots, fruit and vegetables. So how do we do it safely and productively? The answer might lie in our new understanding of the soil. On a farm in south Oxfordshire, techniques developed by a vegetable grower called Iain Tolhurst - Tolly - seem to have anticipated recent discoveries by soil scientists. Tolly is a big, tough-looking man in his late 60s, with etched and weathered skin, a broad, heavy jaw, long blond hair, one gold earring, hands grained with earth and oil. He started farming without training or instruction, without land or any means to buy it. After a string of misadventures, he managed to lease seven hectares (17.3 acres) of very poor land at a reduced rent, 34 years ago. 'No conventional grower would even look at this ground,' he told me. 'It's 40% stone. They'd call it building rubble. It isn't even classed as arable: an agronomist would say it's only good for grass or trees. But over the past 12 months, we harvested 120 tonnes of vegetables and fruit.' Astonishingly, for these 34 years Tolly has been farming this rubble without pesticides, herbicides, mineral treatments, animal manure or any other kind of fertiliser. He has pioneered a way of growing that he calls 'stockfree organic'. This means he uses no livestock or livestock products at any point in the farming cycle, yet he also uses no artificial inputs. Until he proved the model, this was thought to be a formula for sucking the fertility out of the land. Vegetables in particular are considered hungry crops, which require plenty of extra nutrients to grow. Yet Tolly, while adding none, has raised his yields until they've hit the lower bound of what intensive growers achieve with artificial fertilisers on good land: a feat widely considered impossible. Remarkably, the fertility of his soil has climbed steadily. On my first visit, one June, I was struck by the great range and health of Tolly's crops. One plot was a blue haze of onion plants, another a patchwork of sea greens: young cauliflower plants, several kinds of cabbage and kale. There were rows of rainbow chard with gold, green, white and crimson stems. Broad bean pods had begun to sprout from tight pillars of flower. His potatoes were in full bloom, nightshade sinister, stamens like yellow stings. Courgettes extruded rudely behind their trumpet flowers. There were carrots, tomatoes, peppers, beans of all kinds, herbs, parsnips, celeriac, cucumbers, lettuces. He raises 100 varieties of vegetables, which he sells in his farm shop and to subscribers to his veg box. Separating the plots were untended banks, in which scientists studying his farm have found 75 species of wildflowers. These banks are an essential component of his system, harbouring the insect predators that control crop pests. Though he uses no pesticides, none of the vegetable plants I saw showed signs of significant insect damage: the leaves were dark and wide, with scarcely a hole or a spot. Almost single-handedly, through trial and error, Tolly has developed a new and revolutionary model of horticulture. At first it looks like magic. In reality, it's the result of many years of meticulous experiments. Two of his innovations appear to be crucial. The first, as he puts it, is to 'make the system watertight': preventing rain from washing through the soil, taking the nutrients with it. What this means is ensuring the land is almost never left bare. Beneath his vegetables grows an understorey of 'green manure', plants that cover the soil. Under the leaves of his pumpkins, I could see thousands of tiny seedlings: the 'weeds' he had deliberately sown. When the crops are harvested, the green manure fills the gap and soon becomes a thicket of colour: blue chicory flowers, crimson clover, yellow melilot and trefoil, mauve Phacelia, pink sainfoin. 'There's green manure under the green manure,' Tolly told me. 'As soon as we cut the bigger plants, it comes into flower, and the bees go crazy.' Some of the plants in his mix put down deep roots that draw nutrients from the subsoil. Every so often, Tolly runs a mower over them, chopping them into a coarse straw. Earthworms pull this down and incorporate it into the ground. 'The idea is to let the plants put back at least as much carbon and minerals as we take out.' Tolly tells me that 'the green manure ties up nutrients, fixes nitrogen, adds carbon and enhances the diversity of the soil. The more plant species you sow, the more bacteria and fungi you encourage. Every plant has its own associations. Roots are the glue that holds and builds the soil biology.' The other crucial innovation is to scatter over the green manure an average of one millimetre a year of chipped and composted wood, produced from his own trees or delivered by a local tree surgeon. This tiny amendment appears to make a massive difference. In the five years after he started adding woodchip, his yields roughly doubled. As Tolly explains: 'It isn't fertiliser; it's an inoculant that stimulates microbes. The carbon in the wood encourages the bacteria and fungi that bring the soil back to life.' Tolly believes he's adding enough carbon to help the microbes build the soil, but not so much that they lock up nitrogen, which is what happens if you give them more than they need. What Tolly appears to be doing is strengthening and diversifying the relationships in the rhizosphere - the plant's external gut. By keeping roots in the soil, raising the number of plant species and adding just the right amount of carbon, he seems to have encouraged bacteria to build their catacombs in his stony ground, improving the soil's structure and helping his plants to grow. Tolly's success forces us to consider what fertility means. It's not just about the amount of nutrients the soil contains. It's also a function of whether they're available to plants at the right moments, and safely immobilised when plants don't need them. In a healthy soil, crops can regulate their relationships with bacteria in the rhizosphere, ensuring that nutrients are unlocked only when they're required. In other words, fertility is a property of a functioning ecosystem. Farm science has devoted plenty of attention to soil chemistry. But the more we understand, the more important the biology appears to be. Can Tolly's system be replicated? So far the results are inconclusive. But if we can discover how to mediate and enhance the relationship between crop plants and bacteria and fungi in a wide range of soils and climates, it should be possible to raise yields while reducing inputs. Our growing understanding of soil ecology could catalyse a greener revolution. I believe we could combine this approach with another suite of innovations, by a non-profit organisation in Salina, Kansas, called the Land Institute. It's seeking to develop perennial grain crops to replace the annual plants from which we obtain the great majority of our food. Annuals are plants that die after a single growing season. Perennials survive from one year to the next. Large areas dominated by annuals are rare in nature. They tend to colonise ground in the wake of catastrophe: a fire, flood, landslide or volcanic eruption that exposes bare rock or soil. In cultivating annuals, we must keep the land in a catastrophic state. If we grew perennial grain crops, we would be less reliant on smashing living systems apart to produce our food. For 40 years, the Land Institute has been scouring the world for perennial species that could replace the annuals we grow. Already, working with Fengyi Hu and his team at Yunnan University in China, it has developed a perennial rice with yields that match, and in some cases exceed, those of modern annual breeds. Farmers are queueing up for seed. While annual rice farming can cause devastating erosion, the long roots of the perennial varieties bind and protect the soil. Some perennial rice crops have now been harvested six times without replanting. Perennials are their own green manures. The longer they grow, the stronger their relationships with microbes that fix nitrogen from the air and release other minerals. One estimate suggests that perennial systems hold five times as much of the water that falls on the ground as annual crops do. The Land Institute is developing promising lines of perennial wheat, oil crops and other grains. The deep roots and tough structures of perennial plants could help them to withstand climate chaos. The perennial sunflowers the institute is breeding have sailed through two severe droughts, one of which entirely destroyed the annual sunflowers grown alongside them. While no solution is a panacea, I believe that some of the components of a new global food system - one that is more resilient, more distributed, more diverse and more sustainable - are falling into place. If it happens, it will be built on our new knowledge of the most neglected of major ecosystems: the soil. It could resolve the greatest of all dilemmas: how to feed ourselves without destroying the living systems on which we depend. The future is underground.

Two stories surfaced in as many days in the American press this week, citing unnamed officials as saying that US intelligence was instrumental in the targeting of Russian generals on the battlefield and in the sinking of the Moskva flagship cruiser on the Black Sea. The initial report in the New York Times on Wednesday about the generals was partially denied by the White House, which said that while the US shares intelligence with Ukrainian forces, it was not specifically shared with the intent to kill Russian general officers. The next day, NBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post all quoted officials as saying that US intelligence had helped Ukraine hit the Moskva with anti-ship missiles last month, making it the biggest Russian ship to be sunk since the second world war. As a general rule, espionage is carried out in secret, though western intelligence agencies have turned that rule on its head over the past few months by going public with what they knew about Russian preparations for invasion, and then with daily reports on the battlefield and from behind Russian lines. The new disclosures are different however, as they concern what the US espionage agencies themselves have been doing, rather than commenting on the state of the war. In both cases, the US was claiming a hand in historic humiliations for Moscow and for Vladimir Putin, triggering warnings of unintended consequences. Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA official, said: 'My personal view is it's unwise. I am surprised at the extent of official confirmation of the role of US intelligence in the sinking into Moscow, and even more so the killing of the generals. 'The big concern is that this sort of public confirmation of this extensive US role in the setbacks dealt to the Russians may provoke Putin into escalation in a way that he might not otherwise feel it necessary to escalate.' John Sipher, who served for 28 years in the CIA's clandestine service, some of that time in Moscow, thought the decision to disclose details of intelligence sharing was misguided, but for different reasons. 'I just think it's disrespectful to the Ukrainians,' Sipher said. 'It's taking away from the people who are actually on the ground, who are taking advantage of the intelligence, who are collecting their own intelligence, who are fighting day and night.' However, he did not think that it significantly raised the risk of escalation between Russia and Nato. 'Putin understands how the game is played. He gets intelligence to try to kill Americans if the situation is reversed, as he did in Afghanistan and other places. The Russians have spent years attacking us with cyber warfare and disinformation,' Sipher said. 'So I don't think them being upset that America is sharing intelligence is a game-changer.' European officials made clear their own intelligence agencies would not be following the US lead. 'It's stupid,' one official said. 'I don't think it is a carefully coordinated leak.' An official from another European country cast doubt on the centrality of US intelligence to the Ukrainian targeting of Russian generals, saying the main factor was the predictability of Russian officers as they followed rigid Soviet-era doctrine. The breakdown in their secure communications equipment and the top-down hierarchy of the Russian army meant the top officers had to travel to the frontlines to be sure their orders were carried out and Ukrainian snipers were waiting for them. In the case of the Moskva, US officials were at pains to emphasise that Ukraine made its own targeting decisions, and drew information from multiple sources. 'We are not the only sole source of intelligence and information to the Ukrainians. They get intelligence from other nations as well and have a pretty robust intelligence collection capability,' John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said. 'They've been fighting this war against Russia for eight years. It's not like they are completely blind to the way Russia organises itself and the way Russia conducts itself on the battlefield.'", "2302ed9296dbb0866d75c839dc3f625a735a68b9b181e7c6b4f8332c": "", "b2f8a1ce441126d55a35f34c237a35278a00d3a8694c2c54ed2443bd": "The conflict in Ukraine is taking a 'heavy toll' on some of Russia's most capable units, the UK's ministry of defence has said in its latest intelligence report. At least one T-90M, Russia's most advanced tank, has been destroyed in fighting, the ministry added. The T-90M was introduced in 2016 and includes improved armour, an upgraded gun and enhanced satellite navigation systems. Approximately 100 T-90M tanks are currently in service amongst Russia's best equipped units, including those fighting in Ukraine, British intelligence claimed adding that the system's upgraded armour, designed to counter anti-tank weaponry, remains vulnerable if unsupported by other force elements. The report continued: Meanwhile, Ukraine's military command has said that Russia is continuing its assault on the Azovstal plant in Mariupol using tank and artillery fire, reports Reuters.  An additional 50 people have been evacuated from the besieged steelworks in Mariupol, pro-Russian forces have said.  The defence headquarters of Russian-backed Donetsk separatists said on Telegram that a total of 176 civilians have now been evacuated from Azovstal, reports Reuters, who could not immediately verify the claim.  It comes after about 50 civilians were moved from the plant on Friday to a nearby reception centre in territory held by the separatists and dozens of civilians were evacuated last weekend.  'Today, May 7, 50 people were evacuated from the territory of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol,' the separatists said. Russia's most senior lawmaker accused Washington of coordinating military operations in Ukraine, which he said amounted to the US 'directly participating in military actions' against Russia, Reuters reports. US officials have said the United States has provided intelligence to Ukraine to help counter the Russian assault, but have denied that this intelligence includes precise targeting data. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house of parliament, the Duma, wrote on his Telegram channel: It is 5.15pm in Kyiv. Here's where we stand: Good afternoon from London. It's Leonie Chao-Fong with you with all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email.  Russian shelling destroyed a museum dedicated to the 18th century philosopher and poet, Hryhoriy Skovoroda, in the Ukrainian village of Skovorodynivka, Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Sinegubov said. Overnight shelling struck the roof of the Hryhoriy Skovoroda Literary Memorial Museum, injuring a staff member, causing a fire that destroyed the building, Sinegubov said in a post on social media, adding: The most valuable items in the museum had been moved earlier to a safer place, Sinegubov said. Skovoroda, a famous philosopher and poet of Ukraine Cossack origin, spent the last years of his life on an estate of the local landowners in the village of Ivanovka, which was later renamed in his honour - Skovorodynivka, Reuters reports. Sinegubov continued: The head of Ukraine's negotiating team, Mykhailo Podolyak, a key adviser to President Zelenskiy, said more people would be interested in Skovoroda's philosophy and visit the museum after its restoration. Podolyak tweeted: Two Russian missiles hit locations near the Russian border in Ukraine's northern Sumy region today, local governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyi said. A border guard was wounded by the strikes on the Myropilske and Khotin municipalities, Zhyvytskyi wrote on Telegram. Russian forces fully withdrew from Sumy region in early April after advancing into parts of the region at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. It was not able to immediately confirm details of the report.  'It's heaviest of all for the boys,' says Irina as she watches her son, Denys, play one-twos with a new teammate on an artificial surface in Warsaw's northern suburbs. 'His father isn't here, and his older brother joined the army. It's just the two of us. The language barrier is hard for me, but I'm willing to go through all the difficulties. Everything we're doing now' - she motions to a fellow Ukrainian mother, standing along the touchline - 'is for the sake of our children's future.' Denys is one of nine young Ukrainian footballers given a place to play by Turbo Academy, one of the most highly regarded setups in Poland. Most are 13 or 14; they held genuine hope of careers in the game before Russia invaded their country and, while safety was the primary consideration upon leaving, maintaining their prospects was a vital factor too. Football has virtually ground to a halt while Ukraine is defended but Turbo are among numerous clubs in Europe trying to help its budding stars. 'Back home, our boys would put football before everything else,' Irina says. 'But now our house has been destroyed, the pitches bombed, and there is no way they can stay. Here, they are being given a chance.' Most of Turbo's intake are from the academy of the second-tier club FK Kramatorsk, 50 miles north of Donetsk in Ukraine's intensely troubled east. Irina and Denys were exceptions: they had, in fact, moved to Kyiv shortly before the invasion. Denys was ready to join Shakhtar's youth setup, which is based there, when life turned upside down. On 25 March the youngsters arrived, six with their mothers, at the Polish border town of Medyka. Turbo's goalkeeping coach, Grzegorz Jedrzejewski, had learned from a contact that a group of Ukrainian players were looking to leave. With help from the Polish Football Association, he arranged for a bus to collect them. 'We'd been waiting for a week to find out when they were coming,' Jedrzejewski says. 'They had been sheltering in basements, but then they decided the time was right to leave because of all the bombs, and I got the call. They travelled from Kramatorsk to Kyiv, then on to Medyka. I waited at the border, at night, shouting out names from a list. It was a group of people who had no idea what they would be doing from one day to the next. Only when I got there did I fully understand what Putin has done.' Several missiles hit the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa, the regional administration's spokesperson, Serhiy Bratchuk, said. The strikes hit the city after targets in the surrounding Odesa region had been hit by four missiles earlier in the day, Bratchuk said in televised remarks. He did not give further detail about the new strikes, saying that the facts were still being established. From Ukrainian MP, Lesia Vasylenko: Ukrainian journalist Olga Tokariuk said Russian forces were intensifying their attacks ahead of 9 May, Russia's Victory Day commemorating the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in the second world war.  Ukraine's regional military administration said Russia fired four missiles at Odesa earlier today, writing: There were no casualties from the missile strikes, it said.  The Guardian has not been able to confirm the details of the report. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it is hopeful that more civilians will be able to be evacuated from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. The Red Cross and United Nations have been working to get civilians out from the Azovstal plant, where an estimated 200 civilians along with Ukrainian fighters have been holed up for weeks.  Ukraine said 50 civilians were evacuated on Friday, but accused Russia of violating a ceasefire intended to allow dozens more still trapped at the plant to leave. In an interview with Swiss newspaper Neue Zurcher Zeitung, Dominik Stillhart, the ICRC's director of operations, said: He said it was 'extremely frustrating' that it took weeks of painstaking work to get Russian and Ukrainian authorities on board and to organise the logistic details for evacuations out of the southern port city. He added: The Ukrainian government has said that it has destroyed another Russian ship.  The ministry of defence claimed that Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 had hit the landing craft of the Serna project, tweeting: 'The traditional parade of the Russian Black Sea fleet on May 9 this year will be held near Snake Island - at the bottom of the sea.' Pro-Russian separatists in Moldova claim they were hit four times by suspected drones overnight near the Ukrainian border. The interior ministry of Transdniestria released photos of craters it claimed had been created by the strikes and said nobody had been injured.  It comes after nearly two weeks of similar reported incidents in the Transdniestria breakaway region, raising alarm internationally that Russia's war in Ukraine could spread.  Russian forces have held a dress rehearsal for a planned military parade to commemorate Victory Day in Moscow on Monday.  An RS-24 Yars intercontinental ballistic missile rolled through Red Square as part of the rehearsal, while warplanes and helicopters flew overhead, troops marched in formation and artillery vehicles drove by.  The holiday traditionally marks the defeat of Nazi Germany during the second world war, but this year many Russians will be thinking about their troops in Ukraine, reports the Associated Press.  G7 leaders, including the US president, Joe Biden, plan to hold a video call on Sunday with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, ahead of the holiday in a show of unity, the White House has said.  Jill Biden has praised the Romanian government and aid organisations for their help for Ukrainians during a visit to Bucharest - but warned that it was 'just the beginning'. The US first lady made the stark assessment following a briefing at the US embassy, where she was told that Romania had received nearly 900,000 refugees since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Saturday marked the second day of a four-day trip to Romania and Slovakia intended to show US support for Ukrainian refugees.  'It's amazing. It's solidarity here in Romania that you're all working together,' she said. 'I think this is really, unfortunately, just the beginning. Just the beginning.' During the visit she also asked about mental health services and summer schools for students, the Associated Press reports.  'The Romanian people are amazing, to welcome all these refugees into their homes and offer them food and clothing and shelter and give them their hearts,' she added. 'I think the world knows that.' US president Joe Biden has announced another package of military assistance for Ukraine as dozens of civilians were evacuated from Mariupol's besieged steelworks, the last pocket of resistance against Russian troops in the pulverised port city. Worth $150m, the latest US security assistance for the 'brave people of Ukraine' would include artillery munitions and radars, Biden said. A senior US official said it included counter-artillery radars used for detecting the source of enemy fire, and electronic jamming equipment. Friday's new batch brings the total value of US weaponry sent to Ukraine since the invasion began to $3.8bn (PS3bn) - and the president urged Congress to further approve a huge $33bn package including $20bn in military aid, 'to strengthen Ukraine on the battlefield and at the negotiating table'. Biden and leaders of other G7 nations will hold a virtual summit with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Sunday. They are expected to discuss western support for Kyiv in its struggle against Russian president Vladimir Putin's invasion. It comes as the UN security council issued its first statement on the war in Ukraine, but withheld from using the words 'war', 'conflict' or 'invasion'. The statement instead 'expresses deep concern regarding the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine' and voiced 'strong support' for teh UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, in seeking a peaceful solution to the 'dispute'. 'The security council expresses deep concern regarding the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine,' read the statement released on Friday night. Russia, which has a veto in the council, has stymied all prior bids to adopt a statement on Ukraine. The video was a terrible way for Vadim Yevdokimenko to find out that his father had been murdered. Alexei had been missing for weeks, since he went out in early March to scavenge firewood for cooking in their shattered, Russian-occupied town of Bucha. Yevdokimenko and his mother, Lilia, clung to a fading hope that he might have been captured and taken across the border, and that he would return in a prisoner exchange - the fate of some Ukrainian men. But this week the 20-year-old student barber spotted his father's face in footage of Ukrainians tortured and murdered during the occupation. The only solace the family can reach for now is giving Alexei a decent burial, but they cannot find his body. So they had come to wait outside a white tent set up in the grounds of Bucha hospital, where French forensic investigators were swabbing a queue of quietly desperate people for their DNA, to see if any of them have relatives lying in the nearby morgue. After weeks of exhumations, the morgue holds more than 200 bodies that have not been identified. Some were buried without documents and are waiting to be claimed, but many are too disfigured by their deaths, or their treatment after death, to be identified by sight. 'This is the first time we have done this. At first we didn't know how many people would come,' said Andrei Turbar, the deputy prosecutor for Bucha district, as dozens of relatives filled in forms and waited for their tests. The crowd underlined how many people are missing in just one small suburban town outside Kyiv. Ukrainians who saw their loved ones killed or have collected their bodies for burial are grappling with terrible grief. But thousands more are dealing with a loss compounded by the agony of uncertainty. Some are searching for children or parents, a spouse or siblings who went missing when the Russians were slaughtering civilians. Others got bad news from a friend or an image online, but have not been able to find the remains of the person they loved.", "b0cc68ad5e39b2e454ba60518dbd1aefdd5b4d51ff1e759d73131c40": "'They were tears of happiness at first,' says 23-year-old Oksana Balandina of her first dance with her new husband, captured on video by a nurse and now shared across the world. Six weeks ago, Oksana stood on a mine as she was returning home with her then partner, Viktor Vasyliv, also 23, after venturing out to collect some supplies for elderly neighbours on their street in Lysychansk, an east Ukrainian town on the frontline of the war with Russia. Oksana, a paediatric nurse, and mother of Diana, 5, and Illia, 7, was, according to medics, fortunate to survive the blast, but she lost both her legs and four fingers on her left hand. Since then she has had moments of utter despair, screaming out that she wants to die, says Viktor, a carpenter, as he crouches by her wheelchair. Today, however, drinking a takeaway coffee and taking in the sun outside Lviv's municipal hospital, Oksana - quick to smile - says she feels stronger and grateful, as she dusts some tree blossom off her husband's cheek. In part, she says, that is due to an outpouring of support from strangers around the world touched by that moment two weeks ago in the hospital ward when her husband gently lifted his bride, dressed in white, and held her tight as she buried her face in his shoulder and they swayed to tinny music playing on a laptop. Oksana posted the video on the social media site TikTok and she has since put up other short pieces of film of her trying to keep fit to music since the incident. They have been viewed many thousands of times, provoking the vital comments of support that Viktor says his wife has so treasured during these hard weeks. 'The dance was a complete surprise,' she says. 'We had come back to the hospital from the registry office and Natalia and Olesia [hospital volunteers] had brought a dress and a laptop for music. Natalia said, 'What kind of wedding is that without a dance?'' 'It was pure joy and happiness,' she adds of her response to Viktor picking her up. 'But then the realisation came. It's not how I wanted my first dance to be.' There have, of course, been innumerable other difficult moments, not least explaining the injuries to her children, who are staying with their grandfather in the Poltava region to the east. Oksana and Viktor, who are waiting to be taken for rehabilitation at a specialist hospital somewhere in the European Union, have not been able to see the children for weeks. But the memory of that day, and the precariousness of life in Ukraine today, is itself hard to get over, the couple say. The retelling only emphasises Oksana's extraordinary strength. 'We were coming back home and there's a stream at the back of our garden, so we wanted to make a shortcut and took a dirt road,' says Oksana. 'We knew this way very well. I was in front and my husband and friend behind, and I saw there was a missile not far from us, I turned towards Viktor, I yelled, 'Honey, look.' He looked at me and I just suddenly flew into the air, I heard a loud noise in my ears. I looked at my feet and they weren't there. Just bones.' Viktor ran to her. He was breathless, caught in a panic, he says. 'In my head I thought it was over for a moment,' he recalls. 'Then she started to move; she yelled to me to call the ambulance. But they refused to come close because they were afraid of the mines. They said it needed to be cleared.' The couple's friend called Oksana's stepfather on the phone. 'So we carried her with her stepdad and our friend, we carried her to the ambulance. Oksana, despite all the shock she was in, was in charge of everything. She pushed me and I went out of shock, she was the one who told me to call the ambulance. I don't know when would I have come to my senses if she didn't tell me. Then she helped the paramedic.' Oksana explains: 'The paramedic was a young inexperienced girl - apparently she had never seen anything like this. So I helped her. I knew my veins better. I asked for oxygen but they didn't have any. When we came to the hospital, I saw my mom. I saw her and cried 'Mummy', and I lost consciousness.' Oksana does recall brief snippets of the conversations of the medics working to save her life. 'When we were on the way to the hospital, the paramedics were saying, 'If only she was able to make it to the hospital.' When we came to the hospital, the doctors were saying, 'If only she was able to make it through the surgery.' But when the anaesthesia wore off and I came back to my senses, I realised - that's it. I have nothing. I was panicking, I didn't want to live, I didn't want my children to see me like this.' Oksana was transferred from Lysychansk to the city of Dnipro, 200 miles farther west. 'The doctors did an amazing job. They helped me a lot,' Oksana says. 'I realised my life was not over. I need to move on and I need to move on for the sake of my children.' Viktor adds: 'She was very depressed - she yelled she didn't want to live. But in Dnipro there were amazing rehabilitation doctors. They inspired Oksana. And then there was TikTok. She started to post some videos, got a lot of positive comments, and it helped to boost her morale.' Viktor proposed on the 27 April and they were married the next day. 'I just posted these videos just for myself,' Oksana says, 'I didn't think about becoming popular - I just wanted to document the process of recovery. How the rehabilitation goes ... and later, when I will hopefully have prosthetics, I will learn how to use them.' Viktor adds: 'It helps her. Whenever she has a minute, she is trying to read comments to her videos. She smiles, she is happier.' Oksana says she is determined to rebuild her life and continue her career in medicine - in the field of rehabilitation. 'And to show to the others with my own example that you can't give up, that everything is possible and you should keep living no matter what.'", "29e967e846ad6d39a82f0cdc654b7655f50fcc6d30b139a4e62d5ad5": "US president Joe Biden has announced another package of military assistance for Ukraine as dozens of civilians were evacuated from Mariupol's besieged steelworks, the last pocket of resistance against Russian troops in the pulverized port city.

Russia, which has a veto in the council, has stymied all prior bids to adopt a statement on Ukraine. In his latest national address, Zelenskiy said more than 40 women and children had been evacuated on Friday from the Mariupol steelworks after spending two months in underground shelters and that 'diplomatic options' were underway to 'rescue our soldiers'. The Russian defense ministry gave a figure of 50 civilians evacuated, including 11 children, saying they were handed over to the UN and Red Cross, which are assisting in the operation. It said the 'humanitarian operation' would continue on Saturday. About 200 civilians, including children, were estimated to still be trapped in the Soviet-era tunnels and bunkers beneath the sprawling Azovstal factory, along with a group of Ukrainian soldiers making their last stand. Russia announced a daytime ceasefire at the plant for three days starting on Thursday but the Ukrainian army said Russian 'assault operations' had continued by ground and by air. Ukraine's Azov battalion, leading the defence at Azovstal, said one Ukrainian fighter had been killed and six wounded when Russian forces opened fire during an attempt to evacuate people by car. Azov battalion leader Andriy Biletsky wrote on Telegram on Friday that the situation at the plant was critical. 'The shelling does not stop. Every minute of waiting is costing the lives of civilians, soldiers, and the wounded. Ten weeks into a war that has killed thousands, destroyed cities and uprooted more than 13 million people, defeating the resistance at Azovstal and taking full control of strategically located Mariupol would be a major win for Moscow. It would also be a symbolic success as 9 May approaches, the day Russia celebrates the Soviet victory over the Nazis in the second world war. Ukrainian officials believe Moscow is planning a parade in Mariupol but the Kremlin denied any such plans. White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, noted that the G7 meeting will come a day before 'Victory Day' and the leaders will demonstrate 'unity in our collective response' to 'Putin's war'. 'While (Putin) expected to be marching through the streets of Kyiv, that's obviously not what's going to happen,' Psaki said. Since failing to take Kyiv early on in the war, which began on 24 February, Russia has refocused its offensive on the south and east of Ukraine. Taking full control of Mariupol would allow Moscow to create a land bridge between separatist, pro-Russian regions in the east and the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014.

So everyone lining up outside the tent in Bucha has come with the bleakest of hopes - to continue in limbo, confirm a death, or find a body they will be able to bury but not recognise. The UN's top human rights envoy, Michelle Bachelet, highlighted the torment of those with missing relatives 'desperate to know where they are, if they are alive, and how they can get them back', in a speech to the security council on Thursday. Vera Kunayeva and Olga Zaetz are friends whose sons were neighbours and went missing together in early March. The two women are praying their DNA will not match any of the bodies, so they can carry on believing the missing men may be prisoners somewhere in Russia, as Yevdokimenko and his mother did until a couple of days earlier. 'We came to do the DNA tests but we hope it is useless, and shows they are alive,' said Kunayeva, whose 40-year-old son, Vadim, is her only child, a family man with two teenagers. Zaetz's missing son Maxim is a factory worker and at 33 still her baby, the youngest of three brothers. The men went out at 5pm, neighbours said, and were never seen again. 'They started volunteering the first day when the Russians arrived, taking aid to older and vulnerable people,' Zaetz said. 'I wasn't worried because they were always doing it, they were used to helping.' The area was isolated by Russian troops, half-destroyed by shelling and then occupied, so residents who were hungry and reduced to cooking on open fires had to rely on each other for aid. Kunayeva's eyes filled with tears as she described what the village had been through, and remembered Vadim. 'We want this over, we want victory and the Russians destroyed.' The number of unidentified bodies in this small suburban town goes up and down daily, said Turbar. Even as some victims are identified by tattoos, scars or other marks, Bucha's sandy soil is still giving up more grim evidence of Russian brutality. 'In the beginning it was 40 or 50 people exhumed a day. It is going down now. Yesterday we had seven, today four,' Turbar said. Volunteers are helping retrieve bodies from shallow graves, because authorities cannot keep up. Many are only discovered when residents who fled return. 'People are coming back to find a grave in their garden,' Turbar said. 'Perhaps a person driving in a car was stopped by Russians at a checkpoint and they shot him there. Later they let local people bury the body in a nearby house. That wasn't a single incident, it was systematic.' Some of the bodies that cannot be identified were burned, some partly destroyed by the force of explosions that killed them. Russian soldiers intentionally disfigured the faces of some victims. Other corpses were left in cars or on the street so long that decomposition rendered them unrecognisable, after locals were banned from burying them or too afraid to attempt it as fighting raged. The overwhelming scale of atrocities has led to cruel confusion and bureaucratic layering of pain on top of terrible grief. At the morgue where Yevdokimenko went after seeing the video, he was presented with a single severed leg that workers insisted was all that remained of his father for burial. 'They were trying to push a body on me. [Dad's] cards were in the pocket but I think someone must have taken them,' he said. The trousers and shoe did not belong to his father, he said. When he challenged the workers they admitted that chaos often engulfed their efforts and confided that one body bag they opened this week contained three legs. A small town police force, government and hospital used to dealing with alcoholics, petty thieves and a few dozen deaths a year before Russia's invasion could hardly have been adequately prepared to handle one of the biggest war crimes investigations of the century. 'I am still afraid to walk around because I remember there was a Russian tank here or here. At the very end when they knew that they were leaving, they went street to street just killing everyone, grannies, grandpas, someone who was just sitting outside smoking,' Yevdokimenko said, adding that most of the victims were men. 'My classmate, who was 20, was shot because the Russians didn't like his trousers. There are only women left in my circle [so many of the men were killed].' Despite the scale of the challenge, Turbar says the town is determined to seek justice for the dead, and warn Russian forces still fighting in Ukraine - and reportedly committing fresh atrocities - that they cannot brutalise and murder with impunity. 'Emotionally it is very hard to look at these people, some of them I knew before, all the buildings that have been destroyed,' he said. 'But I feel an extreme responsibility to the people of Ukraine to collect evidence so we can take [the Russians] to court. 'What is happening here is nothing compared to Kharkiv and Mariupol, [the number of atrocities uncovered] are going to get even worse. For Bucha, it is over, but there it is still going on, civilians are still dying.'", "84bdc8398b4471bede186f3b4888c64b2e9956749ed03535a0dea090": "", "66149d20707d60a10c9f1c65a0dfe6084ba6cb0274da9ebc03fbe9f4": " Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. The last stronghold of resistance to Russia's siege of Mariupol, the sprawling Azovstal steelworks, has come under intense bombardment this week amid speculation, as Andrew Roth reports, that Russia aims to use the city as a prop in festivities to mark Victory Day on 9 May. This week hundreds of people have been evacuated from the city to safety. Among them, Natalia Usmanova told journalists that she felt her heart would stop as Russian bombs rained down on those hiding in a Soviet-era bunker underground. Azovstal evacuees who arrived in Zaporizhzhia were emotional. 'We are so thankful for everyone who helped,' said Anna Zaitseva, holding her six-month-old baby. 'There was a moment we lost hope, we thought everyone forgot about us.' Elina Tsybulchenko, another evacuee who made it to safety, said: 'They bombed like every second ... You can't imagine how scary it is when you sit in the shelter, in a wet and damp basement which is bouncing, shaking.' As the week ground on, fierce fighting moved inside the steelworks as more civilians fled the city on evacuation buses following weeks of brutal bombardment that have reduced much of it to rubble. Others remained trapped inside the complex. The UN described the city as a 'hellscape'. Roth explained why Mariupol is so important to Russia: the city that few Russians would have imagined as a prize before the war is home to a leading iron and steelworks that played an important role in the city's economy. It was a vibrant port with an active civil society that had withstood the Russian-backed advance in 2014, when Russian artillery came close enough to Mariupol to bombard the city's outer districts, before being driven back. The Kremlin could be keen to take the city as a strategic point in its goals to build a broad 'land bridge' to occupied Crimea, to gain access to another deep-water port that it used to transport coal, steel and grain, and as a symbolic victory - the largest city yet taken by Russia, which has failed to conquer Kharkiv or Kyiv. Amid mounting fears among western officials that Russia's war in Ukraine could drag on for months or years, the Kremlin appears to be focusing its operations around the city of Izium as part of renewed efforts to seize the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Peter Beaumont writes that the new focus of the Kremlin's war - aimed at building the land bridge from the Russian border to Crimea and beyond - has come with a shift in tactics to a slower and more deliberate advance as the Russian military has continued to struggle with logistics and other problems in managing its campaign. The latest stage of the offensive has been marked by an increased concentration of artillery, and the use of artillery fire, to support the slowly advancing Russian troops, with a Pentagon official describing 'slow and uneven' progress in fierce fighting in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. In Donetsk, the streets are empty. Emma Graham-Harrison and Vera Mironova report on the desperate and aggressive draft campaign by Russian-backed separatists controlling parts of eastern Ukraine driving many military-aged men into hiding. The separatist region backed and recognised by Russia announced its draft on 19 February, a few days before the invasion of the rest of Ukraine. To be exempt from the draft, you have to be signed off by senior government officials, who are one of the few groups to be spared the draft. In late March, pro-Russia authorities upped the age limit of the draft in Donetsk from 55 in 65, and on Saturday authorities announced mobilisation in Kherson, a region largely captured by Russia after the war began. Twice, authorities have tried to lure men out of hiding by claiming the draft was over. But when men came out of hiding, many were seized and drafted. Now, husbands, sons and brothers are living in basements and locked indoors at the homes of friends or relatives where no military-age men are registered as residents.  This week's string of mysterious blasts in Transnistria have become a warning sign for many to get out. And as men from the Moscow-backed separatist region in Moldova are being mobilised to fight alongside Russian troops, Paula Erizanu reports of waves of people fleeing to Turkey, Poland and the Czech Republic. On Monday, government buildings were hit by what appeared to be rocket-propelled grenades. The days that followed saw blasts hitting a Russian-broadcasting radio tower and shots reportedly fired near a Russian arms depot. Transnistria, near the Ukraine border, is predominantly Russian-speaking. And the growing concern on the ground is that Moldova could become the next front of the Ukraine war. In 1992 Moldova broke away from the Soviet Union, a year after the region declared its independence. This followed a five-month war where Russian forces intervened on the side of the separatists. No country, not even Russia, has recognised the self-declared Transnistrian Moldovan Republic, but the 'frozen conflict' has kept Moldova partitioned between Russia and Europe ever since. Now, many fear that last week's explosions may be the start of a dangerous thaw. Isobel Koshiw and Lorenzo Tondo report on civilian Ukrainians with no previous experience in exhumation wearing gardening gloves and volunteering to collect hundreds of bodies of those executed and buried in towns bordering Ukraine's capital. Thrust into what has been called one of the worst atrocities in Europe since the second world war, small-town police forces are relying on these ordinary civilians to help. According to Ukrainian prosecutors, more than 1,000 bodies have been recovered so far - many of whom were killed by bombs, making their remains harder to find. Ukrainians are inking the fight for their country on to their bodies, with artists getting requests for tattoos of molotov cocktails, anti-tank missiles and even a type of bread that has become an unlikely symbol of national identity because Russians struggle to pronounce it. Emma Graham-Harrison reports that as people filtered back to Kyiv after Russian troops abandoned their attempts to seize it, tattoo artists noticed an increasing demand for art that paid tribute to this spring of tragedy and violence, and to Ukraine's spirit of resistance. 'I wanted to capture this moment,' said Mariika, a tattoo artist who now has an anti-tank hedgehog on her leg and a molotov cocktail on her arm. For several Saturdays she has joined a group of tattoo artists gathered in a Kyiv party district for a fundraising day at a nightclub, currently out of action because of the war and curfew. Anyone can turn up for a tattoo, and the price is whatever they can afford to donate to the Ukrainian armed forces. Our visual guide to the invasion is updated regularly and can be found here.

In a statement on Friday night, the ministry said that Daniele Franco had signed the decree based on evidence that the owner of the Scheherazade, which has been undergoing a refit at a shipyard in Tuscany since September, has 'significant economic and business connections' with 'prominent elements of the Russian government and with others subject to EU sanctions'. The statement did not name the owner of the vessel, but said the ministry had asked the EU to place the individual on to the sanctions list. The yacht has been blocked pending the adoption of further restrictive measures. The order came amid fears that the vessel, said to be worth $700m (PS530m), was about to leave the shipyard in Marina di Carrara. The Scheherazade has been under investigation since March for potential links to sanctioned Russians, including Putin. A report in the New York Times said that it had been moved out of dry dock and into the water on Tuesday. The newspaper cited a crew member who said it could leave the port imminently. A spokesperson for the Italian Sea Group, a company that repairs and builds luxury yachts, told the Guardian that the vessel was scheduled to set sail by the middle of June.  Marianna Ferrante, the company's marketing director, said: 'Maintenance work is progressing and there are no scheduled departures anytime soon.' The company originally said the EUR6m refit would be completed in early 2023. The yacht is said to be equipped with a spa, swimming pools, two helipads, a wood-burning fireplace and a pool table designed to tilt so as to reduce the impact of the waves. Finance police in Marina di Carrara boarded the Scheherazade in early March as EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs kicked in over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They seized ownership documents from the yacht's British captain, Guy Bennett-Pearce. At the time, US officials said they were also investigating whether the yacht belonged to Putin. Activists working with the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny have also claimed Putin is the owner. A source at the finance police said the investigation was 'very complex' owing to a web of company names that could be concealing the real owner. 'As you can imagine, after all this time, it's not been easy [to identify] an owner, because of all the companies in between,' the source said. 'There is no more information we can give, and asking if it belongs to Putin is like a lottery.' The source would not confirm whether or not police were preparing to seize the vessel. An investigation by La Stampa newspaper in March linked the Scheherazade to Eduard Yurievich Khudainatov, the former president of the Russian state oil firm Rosneft, via a shell company registered in the Marshall Islands. Khudainatov is not on the sanctions list.", "5b0c61f36ce83240acb6c8c91a47b2fe7e77c277994382ee2c29a117": "Michelle O'Neill, set to become the first nationalist first minister of Northern Ireland, delivers a speech at the Magherafelt count.  She opens congratulating everyone elected to the assembly from 'across all parties and of all constituencies'. 'I really look forward to working with all of you, each and every one of you, in the days and weeks ahead,' she says, adding that the results represent a 'defining moment for our politics and for our people'. 'Today ushers in a new era which I believe presents us all with an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality, and on the basis of social justice,' she says. 'Irrespective of religious, political, or social backgrounds, my commitment is to make politics work. My commitment is to work through partnership, not division. 'We will work with those who serve, of all other political perspectives. We will work together. We will show respect and we expect to be shown respect. There is a space in this place for everyone.  'I will provide leadership which is inclusive, which celebrates diversity, which guarantees rights and equality for those who have been excluded, discriminated against, or ignored in the past.' Sir Keir Starmer said he is 'confident' that he did not breach lockdown rules by having a beer and curry at a campaign event. The Labour leader spoke after Durham constabulary confirmed it was investigating claims an evening event attended by the Labour leader with other senior party figures and activists last year might have broken social distancing regulations. Starmer said: 'As I have explained a number of times, I was working in the office, we stopped for something to eat. 'There was no party, no breach of rules, I am confident of that.' Speaking during a visit to Scotland, the Labour leader added: 'The police have obviously got to do their job but meanwhile I am here in Scotland because we have had a fantastic set of results.' He also said that while he called for Boris Johnson to quit after he was fined for attending a party at Westminster during lockdown, he would not be resigning. Sir Keir Starmer's leadership has made Labour 'credible again', the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, added. He was asked by the PA news agency if it was a problem that Labour had made significant gains in London but not in the so-called red wall. He said: 'I'm the mayor of London, not the mayor of red-wall seats. 'I'm really pleased and proud that here in London we have had historic results in seats in central London, in inner London and in outer London. 'Some for the first time ever like Barnet, Westminster the first time since 1964, Wandsworth the first time in 44 years. 'What Keir Starmer has shown in his leadership is that we're credible again.' Sir Keir Starmer's gathering in Durham is 'a million miles away' from Boris Johnson's lockdown rule-breaking, according to the mayor of London. Sadiq Khan was at the Eid in the Square celebrations at Trafalgar Square on Saturday. He told PA: 'Keir is quite clear. No rules were broken. 'He was working incredibly hard all day, had supper in the evening. 'The prime minister who makes the rules, breaking the rules. But also a culture in Downing Street where it's bring your own bottles, it's karaoke machines, it's garden parties. 'Very, very different to what Keir is alleged to have done.'

The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, has been on the broadcast media today insisting Boris Johnson remains an electoral asset and urging his fellow Tory MPs not to act against him over the party's local election results.  Speaking on Sky News, he said: 'If you look at the way that Boris cuts through in places like Nuneaton, places like Newcastle-under-Lyme, other parts of the country as well - Harrow in London. 'People don't like to vote for split parties, for teams that are divided. We are stronger when we are united and that would be my message to all my colleagues.' The elections saw the Conservatives lose almost 500 seats and control of 11 councils, including former Tory strongholds in Westminster, Wandsworth, and Barnet. Read the full story here.  The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, has said Labour's performance on Thursday marked a recovery from a 'near death experience'. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'We know we've got to rebuild trust. We had a terrible near death experience at the last general election, so we're not taking anyone for granted.  'But I think what we saw in the results on Thursday is a firm foundation for going on to win the next general election.' The Liberal Democrats say the British electorate have put Conservative MPs 'on notice' and that they risk being ousted if they keep Boris Johnson as prime minister. The Lib Dems have so far won 867 seats, a net gain of at least 189.  Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald are clapped in by supporters as they arrive at the count in Magherafelt.  In a piece from Edinburgh, historian Rory Scothorne reflects on the Tories' woes in Scotland, where they have been replaced as the second party by Labour.  'Despite a respectable result last year when they held steady at Holyrood, under Douglas Ross's leadership the Tories have failed to renew the sunny centre-right sensibility cultivated by Ruth Davidson, who fronted their recent revival,' he says.  '[Ross's] flip-flopping over Johnson's fitness to be prime minister - calling for resignation before withdrawing the demand - has only reinforced the sense of a man out of his depth.' Scothorne adds that, despite Labour's gains, the SNP still reign supreme, and that Scots are unlikely to deliver Keir Starmer a majority any time soon.  '[Scottish Labour Leader Anas] Sarwar has made small inroads into the softest, most discontented bits of the SNP vote via single transferable vote. But it is not yet enough to swing a first-past-the-post election away from the SNP, so long as independence delivers 40% of voters into the latter's camp,' he says. 'Labour could irritate the SNP, however, simply by returning to main opposition status, and shedding the doomed aura that has shrouded their manoeuvres since 2015.' Read the full piece here.  A picture from our correspondent Lisa O'Carroll at the count in Magherafelt, where Sinn Fein's deputy leader, Michelle O'Neill, and the party president, Mary Lou McDonald, are expected shortly.  Supporters and Sinn Fein's newly-elected assembly members are seen waiting to greet the pair. Sam McBride, Northern Ireland editor of the Belfast Telegraph, says Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is 'at best delusional' to claim the DUP has performed 'extremely well' in the assembly elections.  The DUP Leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, has insisted his party is doing 'extremely well' in the Stormont Assembly election.  The party is set to lose its place as the largest in the assembly to Sinn Fein, which has so far won 21 seats to the DUP's 18. Sinn Fein also has the largest vote share, winning 29% of first preference ballots to the DUP's 21%. Speaking to reports, Donaldson said that unionism had 'held its ground' and that, taken as a bloc, unionist parties would still hold the most seats in the assembly.  'I think there is a lot of spin around results and I'm very pleased with how the DUP has done in our constituencies,' he said. Of the 90 seats up for grabs in the Northern Ireland assembly, 64 have so far declared a result. Here's how things stand.  Sinn Fein has won 21 seats, and is on track to be the largest party overall. The Democratic Unionist party, previously the largest party in the assembly, currently has 18 seats, and will become the second largest.  The Alliance party currently has 13 seats, while the Ulster Unionists have six and the SDLP have four. The Traditional Unionist Voice has one seat, and former DUP member Alex Easton has been re-elected as an independent in North Down. Get all the latest figures on our results page.  A good point from writer Ben Phillips. Sinn Fein's victory in Northern Ireland is certainly significant, but it's worth remembering that, under the terms of the Good Friday agreement, the first minister and deputy first minister are the joint heads of the regional government. The fact that the largest party gets to appoint the first minister is symbolic. Our colleague Rory Carroll looks at what to expect in Northern Ireland in the coming days, given that the DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, said he would not join a new administration until the UK government 'dealt with' the protocol, the post-Brexit deal that puts a trade border in the Irish Sea. Read the full report here.  The BBC's Jayne McCormack reflects on the outcome for the Green party in Northern Ireland. Nicola Sturgeon has said that Sinn Fein's performance in Northern Ireland has shown there are 'big questions' around the future of the UK 'as a political entity'.  Scotland's first minister told PA Media:  However, despite the changes she predicts, Sturgeon said all of the nations of the British Isles will continue to co-operate regardless.", "ef17254265eea3465a1727ed24514512f8603cc9712c94efbaf487fd": "Ferdinand Marcos, the dictator who ruled the Philippines from 1965 to 1986, was the nation's most decorated hero of the second world war. Under his rule, the armed forces were the most advanced in Asia. Even more impressive: his family owns enormous quantities of gold, enough to save the world (it was given to Marcos by a royal family as payment for acting as their lawyer). It will be shared with the people if they regain power. The claims are all false. But that hasn't stop them from echoing across social media, saturating news feeds across the Philippines. Ferdinand Marcos left office in disgrace 36 years ago, ousted by the People Power Revolution, which drew millions on to the streets and forced the family to flee the presidential palace by helicopter. But tomorrow, the Marcos family is poised to make its comeback. Some 67.5 million Filipinos will go to the polls to decide who should replace the populist president Rodrigo Duterte who has reached the end of his six-year term and is barred from running again. Marcos' only son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, known as Bongbong, is favourite to be elected - opinion polls put him far ahead of Leni Robredo, a former human rights lawyer and the current vice-president. A recent survey by Pulse Asia suggests he is the preferred candidate of 56% of voters; Robredo is favoured by just 23%. Analysts have decribed the race as a struggle over the truth, and the culmination of a decades-long campaign to rewrite history and rehabilitate the Marcos name. The election is not being fought just with data and evidence, said Ronald Mendoza, dean of Manila's Ateneo School of Government: 'It's a battle of disinformation.' The Marcoses and their supporters have sought to revise the story of their era and of martial law imposed in 1972, often described as one of the most painful episodes in the country's history. They deny or dismiss the widespread torture documented by rights groups, the extrajudicial killings and the plundering of billions of dollars. Instead, the period is portrayed as a golden age of peace and prosperity. For survivors of the Marcos regime, the acceptance of such accounts by significant sections of the public is incomprehensible. 'If ever he wins, he will be winning on the basis of false narratives and historical distortion,' said Bonifacio Ilagan, convenor of Campaign Against the Return of the Marcoses and Martial Law. 'I lived through the military dictatorship. I have been imprisoned twice. I have been tortured. I had my sister disappeared and most probably killed, friends suffering the same. And now Marcos Jr is making a comeback. It is horrible. It is like a nightmare,' he said. Partnerships have formed to tackle false online claims, including #FactsFirstPH, formed by media outlets such as Rappler, which was cofounded by Nobel laureate Maria Ressa, which has joined with church groups, researchers and others. Tsek.Ph, a coalition of universities, journalists and civil society groups, also corrects false claims on soical media online. 'Every day we sift through this tsunami of disinformation, and decide which ones to fact check. There are just too many,' says Maria Diosa Labist, associate professor at the University of the Philippines' Department of Journalism, and a coordinator of Tsek.Ph. Tsek.Ph runs a tipline where the public can report questionable posts, while researchers also sift through social media for viral disinformation. Its analysis shows that both Robredo and Marcos have been the subject of false claims. But disinformation about Robredo has been overwhelmingly negative, questioning her competence and character. Of the false claims about Marcos, almost all sought to enhance his image, or that of his family. Many relate to his father's era: for example, wrongly claiming that no Marcos critics were arrested during martial law, or that all ill-gotten wealth cases against the family have been dismissed. On TikTok and YouTube, accounts aligned to Marcos seek to glamorise the dynasty, with montages of archive footage, and clips of his sons who are adored by a younger supporter base. 'Marcos Jr himself, his political career and accomplishment aren't really impressive,' said Fatima Gaw, assistant professor of communication research at the University of the Philippines College of Mass Communication. His appeal hinges on his promise to restore his father's legacy, which is the centre of online campaigns. At a recent Marcos concert in Bulacan, the mood was nostalgic. The crowd, dressed in Marcos red, sang along to 70s and 80s rock songs. Attendees spoke fondly of the past. 'His father did a lot of things [for the Philippines]. He built highways, bridges, hospitals,' said Zenaida Catindig, 59. Catindig does not believe the Marcos family stole money from the Philippines. 'If there's a case, they should be in jail right now. They're not in prison. Why are they free, if they are corrupt?' she said. The family has faced a raft of cases, and it has been ruled at home and internationally that the Marcoses possessed ill-gotten wealth. Marcos Jr's mother, Imelda, infamous for her collection of 3,000 pairs of shoes, is appealing a 2018 criminal conviction on seven graft charges. John Agbayani, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government, which was set up to investigate and recover the Marcos family's funds, told Reuters last week that it had retrieved about $5bn, and that a further $2.4bn was bogged down in litigation. More remains missing. Despite such evidence, supporters are unconvinced. 'The Marcos family was wealthy even before they entered politics,' said Catherine Dayao, a 22-year-old student attending the Bulacan concert. Marcos was a lawyer for a royal family, she said. Her brother, a history teacher, told her. 'I can see in him the qualities of his father,' Dayao said, explaining his appeal. 'Bongbong will bring back discipline to Filipinos.' Surveys suggest Marcos is the preferred candidate among all age groups. However, analysts point to the large number of younger voters in the Philippines, who have no memory of martial law. 'There is exposure to disinformation even at very young ages,' said Mendoza. 'They appear to have planted the seeds for future success.' Ensuring there is factually accurate information about the Marcos era should become increasingly crucial even for future elections, he said. Filipinos have ranked at the top of global surveys for time spent on social media, increasing the country's vulnerability to disinformation. Social media platforms were manipulated by president Duterte as he campaigned for election in 2016, and have been weaponised to silence criticism of his administration. One Facebook official described the country as 'patient zero' in a fake news crisis that has grown to threaten democracies around the world. Yet researchers say that what is happening now is far more organised and insidious than Duterte's troll farms. In 2016, the Philippines was experiencing the mere infancy of disinformation campaigns, said Gaw. 'Fast forward six years from then and we see there's actually a whole supply chain that performs this information work for the Marcoses,' she said. If a criticism of Marcos Jr is reported in mainstream media, a counter narrative is quickly provided by a network of online influencers, Gaw said, describing the system as far more industrialised. Proving that such accounts are funded by the Marcos family, or determining the size of the misinformation business is challenging. But it is clear that spreading misinformation is easy work, and it pays, adds Gaw. 'It's so profitable that even if you don't believe in Marcos Jr you would promote him.' Marcos Jr has denied the existence of any organised disinformation campaign. However, in January, Twitter suspended hundreds of accounts that were promoting his campaign for violating its rules on spam and manipulation. Researchers in the Philippines have long accused social media companies of failing to take online misinformation seriously, and of allowing their platforms to be exploited. While Filipinos are among the most keen users of social media globally, these platforms have moderation policies designed with a western perspective, prioritising areas such as alt-right content, said Gaw. 'In the Philippines there's really no alt-right version of things. It's just different political families battling for power.' Tsek.ph does not have a special arrangement with platforms to remove false content, though some members are accredited as third-party fact checkers with Facebook. Of the posts the Tsek.ph coalition reports, it has no idea how many are removed. Stories often reappear and move between different social media sites. Often, claims have been circulating for years and become entrenched within some online communities. Trying to counter such beliefs, in a country where the media has been maligned, threatened and harassed, is an uphill battle. Ilagan fears the election of Marcos Jr would curtail freedoms, and scupper efforts to regain the family's ill-gotten wealth. It would also further distort democracy, he said. 'I think the Marcoses planned the whole thing since they were ousted from the presidential palace. They had all the time, and all the money to design a comeback.' 'How can democracy be true when a handful decides the fate of the greater majority?'

The huge success of Covid vaccines in countries able to get them has led to sharp declines in deaths and severe disease from the virus, even though the latest Covid variant, Omicron, has spread rapidly. 'We need a new vaccine to stop transmissions and there are lots of interesting ideas,' said Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University and a former member of the UK vaccine taskforce who has worked on the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid jab. 'Deaths from the disease, those really awful deaths, had largely been eliminated by the late spring [2021], and they rumbled along, at a very low level and very close to baseline, and they've continued to rumble along almost in a flat line since then,' he said. The baseline represents the number of UK deaths that should be expected based on average mortality data before the pandemic. However, the spread of coronavirus remains a problem, leading to hospitalisation of vulnerable people, keeping many off work and leaving a number of people with long-term health issues. Scientists are pinning their hopes on nasal sprays, rather than shots in the arm, which aim to produce strong immune protection in the nose and throat, to block Covid infections at the gates. More than a dozen trials are under way. 'It's an interesting question whether any of the [current] vaccines have a long-term future,' Bell said. 'None of them are very good at stopping transmissions,' he said and as variants emerged 'they get less good over time' at preventing people becoming sick. 'So you've got a couple of choices. You can make a new vaccine every time you see a variant and it may be less good than the original vaccine so you end up chasing your tail. You could probably use the existing vaccines to boost the elderly people at some sensible interval, preventing them from dying. We have to wait and see if we do see more deaths in that population ... but we haven't seen them yet.' The Canadian immunologist also said 'the booster had no impact on deaths, despite all the rah-rah,' suggesting that two vaccine doses were enough to prevent death and serious illness. 'The booster was driven by the perceived need to increase neutralising antibody levels,' he said. 'This might have some impact on transmissions and symptoms, although we all know it does not do much for Omicron transmissions, but protection against mortality has other correlates and the death rate in doubly vaccinated people looks very low. Indeed the vast majority of deaths are unvaccinated.' The UK's current spring booster campaign, the fourth jab, is targeted at the over-75s, care home residents and those who are immunocompromised. Bell is in favour of another round of booster shots in the autumn for those over 65 and vulnerable people with poorer immune systems, but like some other experts, said he saw little point in offering repeat vaccinations to healthy younger people, children and teenagers, unless a more serious Covid variant emerged. He said he was 'not massively enthusiastic' about immunising very young children. 'Their risk of severe illness is low with Covid and they almost never die. If we had a great transmission blocking vaccine then doing kids would make sense but we don't. Most of the world is going to get Covid, we need to get used to it.' He estimated a 'very high' chance that any new variant will be relatively mild, like Omicron, while the chances of a more lethal variant emerging were 'very low but not nothing'. 'We need to be on the lookout for a highly pathogenic variant that might start killing people at scale and is evading the vaccine response but we see no sign of that today.'", "dea9ca351fec8ad27e5113305993735e4dfa391339bbd7af68806352": "A patient is being treated at a specialist unit in London after they were diagnosed with monkeypox, a rare viral infection. The person had recently travelled to Nigeria, where they are believed to have contracted the illness, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Saturday. They are being treated in an isolation unit at Guy's and St Thomas' infectious disease unit. Although monkeypox can be spread during close contact with an infected person, the agency said it did not spread easily and most people recovered in a few weeks. As a precaution, the UKHSA said its experts were working closely with the NHS and would be contacting those who may have had close contact with the person, including some passengers who were on the same flight. Early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other areas of the body. The rash progresses through different states until it forms a scab which falls off. Dr Colin Brown, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UKHSA, said: 'It is important to emphasise that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low.' He added: 'UKHSA and the NHS have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed.' Dr Nicholas Price, director of NHSE high consequence infection diseases (airborne) network and consultant in infectious diseases at Guy's and St Thomas', said: 'The patient is being treated in our specialist isolation unit at St Thomas' hospital by expert clinical staff with strict infection prevention procedures.' The NHS said infection could be caught from infected wild animals in parts of west and central Africa and was believed to be spread by rodents. Only a few people have been diagnosed with monkeypox in the UK, all of whom had either travelled to west Africa or been in close contact with somebody who had. According to Public Health England, monkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when outbreaks of a 'pox-like disease' were found in monkeys in captivity for research. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Since then, it said, most cases have been reported from DRC and Nigeria, but there have been a handful of cases further afield. In 2003, cases were recorded in humans and pet prairie dogs in the US after rodents were imported from Africa. In December 2019, a patient was diagnosed with monkeypox in England, which PHE said was the fourth case diagnosed in the UK since the first imported cases the year before. There have also been cases in Israel and Singapore.", "014fcf14e4671dccb43eed7537ce1afdeaa08826d0bceb73590e8a11": "At the height of Hong Kong's protests in the summer of 2019, angry pro-democracy legislators shouted in the Chinese territory's legislative council: 'down with John Lee!', as the veteran security chief defended his force's treatment of the protesters and journalists. 'I hope people will understand the chaotic situation and the pressure faced by each and every one at the scene on that day,' Lee said, unapologetically. 'I hope members of the public will not vent their dissatisfaction of the government on police officers, because they are only discharging their duties.' On Sunday Lee, 64, who built a long career in police and security and oversaw the the heavy-handed crackdown on anti-Beijing protesters in 2019, is set to become Hong Kong's new chief executive in a single-candidate selection process to succeed Carrie Lam. Like Lam, he was among the first Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials to be on the US sanctions list for their role in eroding the city's once-guaranteed rights and freedoms. But despite the controversy, by the time the leadership poll takes place more than half of the nearly 1,500 people selected to cast ballots would have already showed their support to Lee - guaranteeing him victory. 'By picking John Lee as the candidate without competition, Beijing is sending a message to the outside world,' said Ho-fung Hung, a Hong Kong-born professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins and the author of the book City on the Edge: Hong Kong Under Chinese Rule. 'The message is that Beijing has cemented control and will continue its tough policy in Hong Kong,' he said. Lee joined Hong Kong's police force as an inspector in 1977. He rose through the ranks and, in 2017 became the head of the government's Security Bureau. Like many of his peers, he speaks fluent English and was educated abroad, holding a master's degree in public policy and administration from Charles Sturt university in Australia. In the last few years, Lee has shown his staunch support for Article 23 - the controversial national security law that was passed in 2020. The legislation bars secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces. Since its enactment, dozens of pro-democracy legislators have either been arrested or have moved abroad. Au Nok-hin, who led the chanting of 'Down with John Lee' in that council session three years ago, was among the 55 members of the opposition who were arrested under the national security law last year. Lee's opponents worry that the former security tsar would eventually turn Hong Kong into another mainland Chinese city by further eroding its once-proud traditions - for example, of press freedom. Last year Lee oversaw the freeze of media tycoon Jimmy Lai's assets, which eventually led to the closure of one of the city's most popular pro-democracy tabloid newspapers, Apple Daily. In November Lee told RTHK, the local public broadcaster, that the government was looking into 'different tactics' to target 'fake news' through legislation. A few months before, the city's new police chief, Raymond Siu, called for a 'fake news' law to tackle 'hostility against the police'. Despite being a sole contender for the top job, Lee has in the past weeks been seen making policy pledges and receiving a growing number of supporters from the city's establishment. On 20 April 148 high-profile figures, including tycoon Li Ka-shing and film star Jackie Chan joined his campaign as advisers. Lee is widely seen as a 'dependable and devoutly loyal' figure to Beijing. Dissenting voices have largely disappeared following last year's electoral changes that allowed only 'patriots' in legislature polls. Before the December vote, Lee warned that candidates who had been banned from running for failing the 'patriots' criteria would try to thwart the elections. 'We have to make sure that they will not succeed,' he said. Analysts say that stability and security will be Lee's main focus. In a closed-door rally on Friday, Lee met with more than 1,000 local figures who will vote and urged the public to have a 'collective mindset'. His supporters also praised him for 'helping Hong Kong to restore order from chaos'. According to a 44-page manifesto published last week, Lee's priority would be to enact Article 23 of the city's constitution. Previous Hong Kong administrations had repeatedly tried - but failed - to make it happen.  'But whether he would enact Article 23 is a moot point', said Prof Steve Tsang, a Hong Kong politics expert at SOAS in London. 'This is because the state security apparatus is already in place through the national security legislation. Therefore, there's no guarantee they'd end up doing that.' Hung said that Lee's security background inevitably sends a strong message, but looking at the dynamics between Hong Kong and Beijing over the course of the Covid outbreak in the city earlier this year, one could also see the ultimate limit to Beijing's sway in the city. 'It seems to me that Beijing still has not decided how to strike a balance between security and maintaining Hong Kong's unique role as an offshore financial centre. The tug-of-war is going to continue for some time under Lee's watch,' he added.", "41f66e447b6a723ade8202e45898966498eaed7136e903f9d5b3ab4f": "An Indian climber died has during a summit push on Mount Kanchenjunga, the world's third highest mountain, an official said. The death is the third to be reported on Nepal Himalayas during the current climbing season which started in March. Narayanan Iyer, 52, died at around 8,200m (26,900ft), while trying to reach the 8,586 metre (28,169 feet) peak on Thursday, said Nivesh Karki, an official of the hiking company, Pioneer Adventure, that organised the expedition. 'Iyer's guide advised him to turn back after he was feeling unwell but he refused,' Karki said while confirming the death. 'He was slower than others and we had two guides assist him. He was very exhausted, couldn't continue and collapsed.' There were several other teams on the mountain, including a Pakistani group that saw one of its members, Sirbaz Khan, become the first person from that country to climb 10 peaks over 8,000m high. Last month a Greek climber and a Nepali Sherpa guide died on other peaks. Mountain climbing is the main tourism activity and a key source of income as well as employment in Nepal, which has eight of the world's 14 highest mountains including Mount Everest. More than 900 foreign mountaineers have received permits to climb 26 Himalayan peaks in Nepal, including Mount Everest, during the current season ending in May.

The Bathophilus flemingi, also known as the highfin dragonfish, was captured on video by a team of researchers in Monterey Bay, California. Named after the mythical creature, the torpedo-shaped fish is a predator that roams the depths of the ocean. The fish can grow up to 16.5cm in length and has long thin rays for fins. Scientists think the wing-like filaments can detect vibrations and can alert the fish of oncoming predators and prey. The dragonfish uses a sit-and-wait tactic in which it hangs motionless in midwater and waits for unsuspecting crustaceans and fish to feed on, according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI). It also uses a bioluminescent filament that extends from its chin. 'It uses that to attract prey that see the spot of glowing light and get drawn to it because they think it's something small enough that they can eat,' Bruce Robison, a senior scientist at MBARI told Live Science. Upon encountering its prey, the fish will open its jaws, revealing a set of sharp teeth, and snap its mouth shut. 'In more than three decades of deep-sea research and more than 27,600 hours of video, we've only seen this particular species four times! We spotted this individual just outside of Monterey Bay at a depth of about 300 meters (980 ft),' the researchers said in a YouTube video caption of the dragonfish swimming. The fish captured by researchers on camera had a bronze hue unlike that of any other deep-sea species. 'They are just amazing animals, and part of what is appealing is that color pattern,' Robinson said. He added the bronze hue could probably be a type of camouflage as it absorbs the blue light that reaches the ocean's depths. As a result, the fish blends into its dark environment and becomes nearly invisible. 'But when we shine our white lights on it, it's just gorgeous,' Robinson said.", "a1159151373153de162ae55807c7bf433a12596b3e4c64484ef24246": "Abba pulses through the nightclub and I dramatically burst into tears due to a recent breakup. I apologise for my outcry to friends over a late-night takeaway. I watch The Worst Person in the World on a Sunday night solo date and weep into my popcorn. I meet my mum for lunch and wail over a jacket potato. 'I'm...' I start. She interjects. 'Stop. Saying. Sorry.' I was born the year Prozac came to market in the UK. In 2004, by the age of 14, I was a Prozac user. It's strange to think that as a young, confused teen, I had been part of a profound social-historical change. Before the mid-2000s, adolescents taking psychiatric medication experienced a hefty stigma. If, like me, you were born in the 1990s, you've lived through a psychopharmacological breakthrough. In 2021, the number of teens taking antidepressants in the UK reached an all-time high. And, according to the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, the number of patients under 17, medicated for anxiety, rose by 26% between 2015 and 2020. In the wake of the breakup, I decide to make a trip home to my parents, so I can wallow, yes, but also so I can trail through a box of psychiatric medical notes from my adolescence that I find in the loft. 2004: 'Your daughter is describing a classical description of florid depersonalisation. This is normally onset by a trauma. The standard treatment is a few weeks on SSRIs. I suggest we start her on Prozac. It's not yet licensed for her age, but I think it's our best port of call.' Depersonalisation is a type of anxiety disorder that can manifest as a feeling of being disconnected or detached from the world. For some people, including my teenage self, it can feel as though the world is like a movie that we are watching rather than being a part of. When I ask my mum about those difficult years, she tells me she had no idea what was wrong with me. 'You were struggling and it had gone on so long. You were desperate. We didn't really talk about mental health before you came along. Other than Auntie Nancy' - my 101-year old great-aunt, who had shock therapy after witnessing someone get crushed by a train - 'but even she kept it all hushed up. Me and Dad, we didn't really know much about it.' I try to push her further. The psychiatrist said depersonalisation is often brought on by trauma. I search for environmental triggers. 'It was so physical,' my mother says. 'I tried my best to talk things through with you, to calm you. But you were getting worse and it was hard to watch. So I went to the GP and she referred me to a child psychiatrist.' I still remember how it manifested physically. It began way before the depersonalisation days of my teenage years. I was 10 when I developed an unbending need to 'organise the house' before bedtime. I'd spend an hour lining up all the kitchen utensils in a straight line, followed by the ornaments in the living room. The finale took place in my bedroom. I'd spend an infuriating amount of time putting my slippers in the 'right' place, making sure my cupboard doors were perfectly shut, lining my curtains up 'correctly'. If I didn't, something horrible would ensue, probably involving freak accidents, cancer and a family member. Or so I convinced myself. And then when my teenage years hit, the anxiety became more extreme. I first experienced a depersonalisation attack just before my GCSEs in a busy Topshop store and became convinced I was in the midst of a dream so took to shaking a poor, helpless stranger to 'wake me up'. Those waves happened countless times. Eventually, that dreamlike state went from lasting for short periods to becoming chronic. I was so disassociated, so ghost-like, I felt I was experiencing two worlds unfolding at the same time: my external reality and the chaotic internal experience in my head. No wonder my parents felt desperate. 'I didn't know what to do,' my mother says. 'I remember Dad was watching The Sopranos around the time we took you to the psychiatrist. Remember Tony mentions Prozac? We felt relieved! To hear someone else mention it all. It made us feel less alienated.' Mum would try to reassure me, saying: 'I'm diabetic, I use insulin. You're anxious, you use Prozac.' That was the tagline for SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors): it prioritised the scientific cause and put the social on the backbench. We know now that the serotonin-imbalance theory (that anxiety and depression were caused by low levels of serotonin) is not the answer. 'There is not a single peer-reviewed article that can be accurately cited to directly support claims of serotonin deficiency in any mental disorder, while there are many articles that present counterevidence' (2014, Lacasse and Leo). And yet I, and millions of other teenagers, swallowed the narrative that we were chemically unwell and muted the social context surrounding it. I was hugely fortunate that I didn't experience an intense traumatic event. But, there were some pretty evident triggers leading to my highly anxious state. I spent two years, as a young kid, out of school filming a television soap surrounded by adults and adult issues (drugs, sex and secrets). Weekends were spent with my tight-knit family at my aunt's house. She was paralysed from her neck down due to MS. Each Sunday we witnessed her body decline and her struggle increase while having to keep up a stifling veneer of loud positivity. I couldn't handle the emotional silence.  Alongside all of that, transitioning to being a teenager is a universally terrifying experience. For my age group, it was the era when the internet unleashed its dirty claws and our carefully constructed world became an intense flood of terrorist attacks, celebrity breakdowns and misogynistic porn that I couldn't get my eyes away from. And although I was one of the lucky ones to receive Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, my sessions focused more on 'coping' than 'feeling'. So, I clung tightly on to the more palatable belief that I was 'ill' and with medication I'd be 'well'. 2005: 'She's been complaining of a number of symptoms. It seems she is highly anxious. Previously she had depersonalisation. I recommend we put her on Escitalopram.' I ask Mum if they were nervous about me taking Prozac. 'It wasn't something we wanted to do. It felt like there was no choice. It was urgent and we were out of our depth.' And it worked. Before, I couldn't get through a night without waking in the early hours fuelled with adrenaline, with my legs cycling in the air - in the midst of a panic attack. I couldn't get through a day without ringing my mum, filled with terror, from the school toilets. I felt like I had very little control over my thoughts and experiences. Soon, though, with the help of my nightly pill, the voice in my head, my distorted reality and general existentialism dissolved and finally I was able to focus on things other than my own draining existence. The SSRIs potentially saved my life, but they also changed my life. While my peers were experiencing the dark depths of emotion, I had learned to distrust myself. To Kill a Mockingbird was one of the GCSE texts at the time. My love for it was shaded by a selfish preoccupation. Atticus tells Scout: 'Before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.' I remember reading the line aloud in class and spiralling. 'How can I live with myself if I don't know who I am without these drugs pumping around my brain and body?' I'd been on the medicine for at least a year and the question made me bereft. When our culture tells us that our teenage years are the most critical and formative stages for our search for selfhood, how are the psychologically medicated meant to take part in this rite of passage? And I can only imagine how this must feel even more pressing for teenagers now growing up in an era that worships 'self love' and pays homage (and money) to nurture the 'authentic self'. These were the years of impending firsts that would shape my future. I'd yet to have my first kiss let alone my first sexual experience, my first friend breakup, my first grief; I didn't know my social niche, my political leanings, the music I liked, the type of relationships I wanted to build. I didn't know myself. And the films I was watching and the books I was reading were telling me that during these core years, I would work out my identity. Problem was, I was pilled up. The idea of introspection filled me with horror; it was the very act that earned me the 'mental health patient' status in the first place. Rather than allowing space and time to listen to my emotions and responses, I disregarded them as meaningless chemical mutations. 2008: 'I think it would help if we increased her citalopram. The panic isn't subsiding, so I think this will do us good.' And so I cracked on, while other teens were rebelling or arguing with their parents or having their hearts broken, and committing to the rollercoaster highs and lows of puberty, I wasn't really. I got good grades, I kissed boys, I pursued my dream of acting, I swallowed my pills and I got on with it. Adolescent psychiatrist Professor Peter Hill, who headed Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at St George's, University of London and later worked as a consultant psychiatrist at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, explains: 'We have to be careful about the chosen dosage of SSRIs and medication that we administer to young people. It needs to be part of the discussion when deciding on a treatment plan... Young men and women can experience loss of libido and this is particularly important to consider during the ages where many experience a sexual awakening. Problem is, GPs are time-poor and resource-poor, which leaves them with little else to do than prescribe.' At 23, now on a 20mg dose of citalopram, I was in a rehearsal room with a cast of actors taking part in a bizarre acting technique known as 'emotional recall'. That meant summoning traumatic moments from our past and reliving them in front of an audience. I watched as 14 young people broke down to the applause of our director. And then it was my turn - I was reliving the death of my aunt. Her decline from MS to ovarian cancer. I built the space, set the scene, and then... Nothing. I felt nothing. Dead. Numb. In that moment it dawned on me, I hadn't cried for the entire time I had been on medication. That was my trigger. Within a matter of weeks, I sought help to deprescribe myself in a slow weaning-off process. 2013: 'We can decrease your citalopram now. If your anxiety increases, come back to me.' I recall the first time I cried again: I was watching The Curious Incident of The Dog in The Night-Time and a golden retriever puppy pops its head out of a gift box. I was so enthusiastic about the tears pouring out of me they basically stopped immediately. My mum laughs when I tell her. 'I was so nervous when you came off about how you would deal with things without medication. I didn't know if you had the tools to get through.' I was nervous, too. The process of untangling 'normal emotions' and my medical judgment of them has been a long and ongoing task. I've found myself clinging on to various other numbing devices to swerve me from looking inwards, but slowly and with some integrative therapeutic help I started to allow myself to 'feel' without immediate analysis. I experienced and breathed into my anxious edges. Professor Hill tells me: 'We don't know the long-term chemical effects of SSRI use when prescriptions are continued for years. If possible, caregivers and medical professionals need to be cautious about treating young patients year in year out.' No randomised clinical trials have yet been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of long-term treatment in primary care. This is an infuriating fact to hold while acknowledging the current state of the mental healthcare system. Young people are at the mercy of their doctors and their caregivers and most are doing the best they can with what they've got. And what they've got is pretty dire. The NHS had 4.3m referrals for conditions such as anxiety and depression in 2021, and 25% of them were for children and teenagers. So it's no surprise that so many GPs are reaching for medication while their patients slowly climb up the waiting list for therapeutic help. I ask my mum if she'd change anything. 'About medication?' I nod. 'I don't think I'd do anything differently. They brought you back to us.' She reflects the question. 'Do you wish we handled it differently?' I think about the day I met the psychiatrist as a 14-year-old scared of the world. I imagine him taking off his glasses and rather than reaching for a prescription for the wonder drug of the decade, he leans forward on his chair and says, 'Daniella, I understand.' He says: 'Being a teenager is a pretty insane experience.' He acknowledges the reality of it all. 'It's scary to see a family member get sick, it's scary to realise your parents are flawed, it's scary to notice the systemic injustice in the world and the overwhelming pressure to work out your view on things.'  He'd offer me some psychotherapy, he'd advise me to visit my aunt alone, and hold her hand, and ask her how she feels about facing her impending mortality. He'd urge me to limit my time in front of screens and to spend more time outside. He'd remind me to eat well and suggest joining a sports team. He'd smile and tell me to fancy whoever I wanted. He'd encourage me to spend time with friends and to not be afraid to tell them how I'm feeling. He'd tell me to write to my MP to prevent our national mental health services from being decimated and reassure me that it's possible to make change in the world. And after, he'd send me on my way and ask me to come back in a week to decide if I want to start taking Prozac. My hunch is, this wouldn't have made a single bit of difference and I'd come back the following week even more bereft and desperate for medication. By the time I found myself in the psychiatrist's chair in 2004, I felt like I was living in a pretty disgraceful dimension; I was terrified. I reply to my mum. 'No. I needed an intervention. I just wish I hadn't viewed my experience purely as a biomedical imbalance that needed to be fixed. I wish it had been less binary.' My mum agrees. 'We've all changed. We've all developed. There's more emotional space for all of us now.' My mum and I clear away the papers, come down from the loft and watch Notting Hill on her bed. I laugh wildly and then cry immediately. My mum hands me the tissues and I stop myself apologising for the tears.", "82c80a98876ab8f681c4a4e127083aab9aca43247ed3a2dce5e7c8f5": "Savita Halappanavar was 31 years old when she died of blood poisoning nearly a week after she arrived at University Hospital Galway (UHG) in Ireland complaining of intense back pain. Halappanavar, a dentist from Karnataka, in south-west India, was 17 weeks pregnant with her first child and went to hospital with her husband, Praveen, on Sunday 21 October 2012. Within hours, doctors said a miscarriage was inevitable, even though a foetal heartbeat could be heard. By this point, Halappanavar was in 'unbearable' pain and 'very upset', according to healthcare staff. The plan was, she was told, to 'wait and see' if she would miscarry naturally. At the time, Irish law stated that abortions were permitted only if there was a 'real and substantive' threat to a woman's life. By Tuesday, there had been no miscarriage. The couple asked whether one could be induced but were told by the doctor: 'Under Irish law, if there's no evidence of risk to the life of the mother, our hands are tied so long as there's a foetal heart[beat].'  Halappanavar developed a high fever. On the Wednesday morning, the medical team diagnosed infection and, later, septic shock. Her condition was deteriorating rapidly. A plan was made, but not enacted, to give Halappanavar a drug to induce abortion. According to the Health Service Executive inquiry, by this point, the death of the foetus was certain and the appropriate treatment was to terminate the pregnancy because of the risk to Halappanavar's life. Halappanavar spontaneously miscarried mid-afternoon on Wednesday and was admitted to intensive care. She was now critically ill with severe sepsis and multiple organ failure. She suffered a cardiac arrest and died in the early hours of Sunday 28 October, almost a week after being admitted. The case sparked outrage in Ireland and highlighted how the law put women with life-threatening medical conditions at risk in Irish hospitals. In media interviews, Halappanavar's husband revealed that he and his wife had repeatedly asked for the pregnancy to be terminated but had been refused and told: 'This is a Catholic country.' Protesters took to the streets, calling for accountability and change, accusing the Irish state of failing to protect its citizens. An Amnesty International report in 2015 said her 'entirely preventable death was a consequence of Ireland's restrictive abortion law'. Anti-abortion campaigners said the case was being exploited by those with an agenda to liberalise Ireland's laws, and the Catholic church declared that a woman had no more right to life than the foetus. The government, under intense public scrutiny, carried out multiple inquiries into Halappanavar's death. In the HSE's final report, the investigation team stated that a termination of pregnancy was medically indicated and would have been performed in 'other jurisdictions'. In May 2018, Ireland voted by a landslide to repeal its near-total ban on abortion. The referendum - in which 66.4% voted Yes, a majority of 706,349 - drew the highest turnout for a ballot on social issues. Olga Reyes, 22, waited in pain for hours at the hospital ward in 2006. She had already been turned away from one hospital but arrived at the next one with the proof that she needed urgent care: an ultrasound scan from a private clinic that showed an ectopic pregnancy was rupturing her fallopian tube. The fertilised egg had implanted itself outside her womb and the embryo, at about six weeks old, could not survive but was threatening her life: Reyes was bleeding to death. Doctors delayed treatment, fearful of the repercussions of the ban on therapeutic abortions that had been introduced only months earlier, in November 2006. By the time they took Reyes for surgery it was too late. The 22-year-old law student, who had celebrated her wedding only two months earlier, suffered repeated heart attacks during the operation and died from cerebral arrest due to haemorrhaging. In a report published the same year on the banning of therapeutic abortions in Nicaragua, the rights organisation Human Rights Watch said she should have been treated immediately under government rules on ectopic pregnancies, but the contradictory new ban on therapeutic abortions meant doctors feared intervening. Only days after the law was changed, another young woman, the same age as Reyes, spent days asking for treatment from a local hospital without success. When she was transferred to another hospital it was, again, too late. She died of a cardiac arrest. The penal code Nicaragua introduced to enforce its ban included prison sentences for anyone performing abortions, as well as the women seeking them, regardless of whether their lives were in danger. It was because of this, her husband told the media, that Reyes was left bent double in agony in the hospital ward. The young women's deaths did not alter the course of Nicaraguan law. After the ban on therapeutic abortions in 2006, more amendments brought a blanket ban by 2008, with no exceptions for saving the woman's life. The morning before her death, Izabela* texted her mother from the hospital. 'The child weighs 485g. For now, because of the abortion law, I have to stay in bed and they can't do anything,' she wrote. 'They will wait for the baby to die or for something to start happening. If it doesn't then great, I can expect sepsis.' Izabela, 30, owned a hair salon in Pszczyna, a small town in Silesia. On her Instagram account Pani Iza, as she was known to customers, would regularly post photos of her influencer-worthy wedding coiffures and hair transformation. Her clients did not spare compliments. 'The best hairdresser in the world, you can see that she loves her job,' reads one of the last online reviews dated June 2021, a month before Izabela died. 'Thanks to her, I went from black to blonde and my hair survived!' When her waters broke at 22 weeks, Izabela thought it was stress. She had spent the day at hospital with her nine-year-old daughter, who had fallen from her scooter. Izabela was taken to hospital the next day, though no treatment was undertaken until the next morning. 'They can't do anything, because then it'll look like they did it on purpose,' she texted her mother, to explain why doctors were not inducing the birth hours after the waters broke. 'They have to wait for it to happen on its own. And if it doesn't, then we're waiting for the heart to stop beating,' she wrote. 'The woman is like an incubator. And the baby is suffering too - it has nothing to breathe with.' According to a Polish law introduced in 2021, abortion is legal to save the health or life of the mother and in cases where the pregnancy is a result of rape. Previously, the procedure could also be legally carried out in cases of severe foetal abnormalities. Although the doctors could have legally aborted, they chose not to until it was too late. The law that would have allowed them to do this was 'difficult to apply in practice', says Jolanta Budzowska, the lawyer representing Izabela's family in a court case against the hospital. 'If they carry out an abortion too early and the prosecutors then decide that there was no danger to the mother [at that point] they can face up to three years in prison. Consequently, doctors are more cautious in their decisions.' As doctors waited for the foetal heartbeat to stop, women on Izabela's ward recall her pleading with the staff. 'She felt that something was not right. But they kept telling her that the heart is beating, and that as long as the heart is beating this is the way it must be,' one woman told Polish media. 'I can still hear her words to this day: that she wants to live, she doesn't want to die, that she has people to live for,' the woman said. After nationwide protests, the hospital where Izabela died was fined 650,000zloty (PS120,000) by the Polish health service. The court case against the doctor responsible for Izabela during her stay at the hospital is ongoing. The hospital's director resigned in March. Manuela*, a mother of two from El Salvador, did what most people would do when she fell ill while pregnant in 2008: she went to hospital. Tragically, she miscarried, but instead of medical and social support, she was handcuffed to her hospital bed and interrogated by police. Manuela, 33, whose full name has never been made public, was charged with aggravated homicide under El Salvador's draconian anti-abortion laws, and sentenced to 30 years in prison. She died of cancer two years later - a disease that activists say was ignored and left untreated during her incarceration. 'The stories of women in El Salvador who have been unjustly criminalised for experiencing obstetric emergencies, as happened to Manuela, should also serve as a global example of the terrible consequences of criminal restrictions on access to a service such as abortion,' says Carmen Martinez, an associate director in Latin America for the Center For Reproductive Rights, a US-based human rights organisation. Last November, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) ruled that the state was responsible for Manuela's death, having violated her rights to life, health, judicial protections and guarantees, freedom from discrimination and gender violence. The court ordered El Salvador to pay reparations to the young woman's family and to reform its strict abortion laws and healthcare policies. 'There is no doubt that Manuela suffered an obstetric emergency,' stated the landmark ruling. 'Such situations, as they are medical conditions, cannot lead to a criminal sanction.' El Salvador has some of the world's most restrictive abortion laws. Since 1998, the procedure has been banned without exception, including in cases of rape and incest. Over the past 20 years, more than 180 women have been jailed for murder for having an abortion after suffering obstetric emergencies, according to rights groups. 'I remember my mum, she gave us advice and never left us alone. It is painful to grow up without a mother because that love is incomparable,' Santos de Jesus, Manuela's eldest son, said in a statement before the hearing in March last year. 'I ask the state not to do these things because they left us abandoned without a mother.' At the time of the ruling, many women's rights activists believed that the Americas could be on the path to further liberalisation of abortion laws - and decriminalisation gains in Colombia and Argentina fuelled those hopes. However, the leak of the US supreme court's draft opinion to overturn Roe v Wade has many rights groups worried that progressive policies may remain out of reach. 'The threats to abortion rights in the US matter to all of us because it is a terrible precedent at the international level,' Martinez, one of the lawyers who argued Manuela's case before the IACHR, says. 'This does not mean that what happens in a court like the one in that country can affect the achievements we have made in El Salvador and throughout Latin America, and for which we will continue to work with more enthusiasm. 'Roe v Wade must be protected as well as all laws that have advanced in the decriminalisation of abortion in the world. The fight for our rights has no borders.' Mildred* was a 15-year-old girl from Manyani estate in the Kenyan city of Nakuru. She was admitted at the Nakuru Level 5 hospital last summer with acute abdominal pains and uncontrollable vomiting. She died writhing in pain, 20 weeks into a pregnancy she had tried and failed to end using herbs and salt. Her anguished father, David, explained that the family did not know about her pregnancy. Mildred had travelled to the family's rural home in Bungoma, where, her family believe, she tried to end the pregnancy with the help of an older woman she knew there. 'I did not know that my daughter attempted to terminate her pregnancy using a mixture of herbs, concentrated drinks and salt, a secret she kept close to her heart,' her father says. 'I wish my daughter had accessed a safer abortion ... terminating the pregnancy was a better option to her happiness than trading her life with herbs that caused her infection and painful death,' he says. At the same hospital, two years ago, Betty* died after trying to use detergent to end her pregnancy. The pain of the loss is still raw for her mother, from Racecourse estate, in Nakuru. 'I thought my daughter was suffering from malaria. She had severe headache, vomiting and complained of a severe headache,' she says. Betty died on 19 May 2020 in agony. 'It is sad that my daughter suffered in silence. I would have supported and walked with her in her pregnancy journey, and guaranteed her a safe delivery,' says her mother. 'It pains me that she died such a painful death, yet I could have helped raise the baby as she continued with her studies.' Her mother claims Betty was encouraged to take the detergent by her peers for fear of being forced to drop out of school and the stigma that comes with a teenage pregnancy. Kenyan society views teenage mothers as failures, with a number being denied education and forced into early marriages, often with abusive men. 'I wish there was a way of stopping my daughter from dying,' says her mother. 'I trusted she would save me from poverty.' In Kenya, abortion is outlawed under the constitution, with the exception of pregnancy from rape, pushing women and girls into crude methods of abortions, risking their health and their lives. According to the most recent Demographic Health Survey, 35% of maternal deaths in 2014 were as a result of unsafe abortions. Dr Susan Gitau, chair of the Department of Counselling Psychology at Africa Nazarene University, says many of those who survive such unsafe procedures suffer lasting trauma. 'Psychological counselling is key, counselling that should be done within 48 hours,' she says, 'because abortion is illegal, girls do not access this.' * Names have been changed to protect identities.", "9570ebbff569269a7dbdc385389456158be87747a357bbd8ac70ff2f": "Sir John Bell, the Canadian immunologist, is a familiar sight to locals along the stretch of the Thames near his home in Wallingford, just outside Oxford, where he and his wife can often be seen rowing in a double scull. During the pandemic, Bell's voice became familiar to millions of radio listeners too. As news broke that a viable Covid-19 vaccine was on its way, following successful trials by Pfizer and BioNTech, Bell was asked on BBC Radio 4 whether the world would now return to normal. His response was an emphatic 'yes, yes, yes'. His words not only lifted spirits: they moved markets. As regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, and an early member of the government's vaccine taskforce who had worked on Oxford University's Covid-19 vaccine with AstraZeneca, the 69-year-old's words carried weight. Last December, he confidently predicted that Omicron was 'not the same disease we were seeing a year ago' and that high Covid death rates in the UK were 'now history'. Speaking to the Observer in a restaurant on Oxford's high street, sipping a cup of tea, Bell is still upbeat. 'The vaccines have had a very powerful and durable effect on death ... most people who have had the vaccine are completely safe,' he says. 'People dying now, since last July, are Age 69 Family Married with three children. Education Attended Ridley College in St Catharines, Ontario; studied medicine at the University of Alberta, graduating in 1975; Rhodes Scholar in medicine at Oxford University; postgraduate training in London and at Stanford University.

How he relaxes Rowing or sculling on the Thames, swimming in the university pool, hiking and cycling. unvaccinated. That's tragic,' he adds, while acknowledging that frail elderly people and the immunocompromised are also at greater risk. For that reason, he says, it would be sensible to give more booster jabs in the autumn to people over 65 and those with poor immune systems, while healthy younger people, children and teenagers don't really need them - unless a more severe Covid variant emerges. 'Two things could happen: one is that the vaccines genuinely last a year or 18 months against death, or we get a variant which is much more pathogenic, in which case we need another one [vaccine],' he says. He sees a 'very high' chance that if a new variant emerges, it will be relatively mild like Omicron, while the chances of a more lethal variant are 'very low but not nothing'. The main challenge now is to come up with a jab that stops transmission of the virus, but Bell is optimistic about the second generation of Covid vaccines, which are expected to be on the market within one to two years. A nasal spray could stop transmission, he and other scientists hope, while vaccines that use T-cells to kill infected cells could offer longer-lasting immunity than current jabs and may also be better at fighting virus mutations. While there is plentiful global supply of vaccines, they remain very unevenly distributed, and many people in poorer countries have still not had a single dose. Bell is proud of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, of which close to 3bn doses have been sold in 180 countries, and at not-for-profit pricing until late last year. However, despite being billed as a 'vaccine for the world', it was at the centre of a political controversy a year ago, with accusations over efficacy, supply and side-effects. Bell says the 'uninformed' comments made by politicians such as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, cost many lives at the time because people worried about the safety of taking the jab, in particular in Africa. Macron's comments were hyped up by social media, a campaign 'provoked by third parties' designed to cause disruption, he says. 'Imagine if you are living in [former] French West Africa and the president of France says: 'don't use this vaccine'. Imagine what you think if you're the guy on the street. Vaccine hesitancy in Africa has been driven by uninformed bad press, and the problem is no one is accountable for it.' While the AstraZeneca shot has not been approved in the US, Bell thinks it will continue to be used across the world as a booster jab, and studies have shown it to be particularly good at boosting Chinese-made Covid vaccines, in African, South American and some Asian countries. Bell, who has dual citizenship, has kept his Canadian accent. He drives a Tesla, but is regarded as pretty down-to-earth by colleagues. His former headteacher at Ridley College has described him as very humble for a man who has served several prime ministers as one of the UK's top epidemiologists. He was born into a family of scientists - his mother taught pharmacy at university while his father was a professor of haemotology and his grandfather a professor of anaesthetics. Bell studied medicine in Canada and at Oxford, before eventually becoming a regius professor in the subject (a chair originally sponsored by King Henry VIII), setting up three biotech companies and advising the UK government on its life science strategy. He misses lab-based research, he says, but 'you can't do everything'. Appointed UK life sciences champion in 2011, Bell has been advising the government on how to turbocharge the industry, which is second only to the US's in size. According to figures from the BioIndustry Association (BIA), PS4.5bn of investment poured into UK biotech last year, a 16-fold increase from 2012. 'Now that we've done Brexit, for better or worse, this is the one thing we have to do: to make ourselves a success in terms of growing new, exciting companies with exciting science-based discoveries that we then go and sell to the world.' Bell chairs Immunocore, whose treatments use the body's immune system to kill cancer. Its drugs are developed in Oxford, but it is listed on America's Nasdaq exchange, where valuations are higher. 'We have lots of startup capital but we've got no growth capital,' Bell says. 'The City of London with its great financial institutions, pension funds and insurance companies - they do not invest in private companies.' There is hope: the government wants to make it easier for pension schemes to invest in illiquid assets to improve returns for savers, and is running a consultation. If the rules are changed, he says, 'I'll be the first guy dancing in the street.'", "d1482ac17e93939e6af60bb9be584c82e8b4e348ffa7377e0047bc72": "", "ac070e5317c087664c530e3927bfacb3998871d434362a924e2e4ba3": "", "531424144daa07d9d07799734d9bff2c615553470fd4ac63f2b66f7d": "", "4884ac7dacf9e2c8de2c6e07dca2e8d5786898bb1727a95e8f0be21c": "", "0642786fb5168b3b84f402aa3aeaf5f5c4b0e117128cedc6e77c90b9": "", "be454522d39e354a3e71a06d7761dbc7f1975212ebc94a2f7bb2d6cc": "", "2614432cc04571fc06473b79f6747cd32c6424a71ec32a14a77ad77e": "", "522dcccb80c14ed5ae42f1a6ddab8b0743c553902540ca3e8560be76": "", "ad8e50525672caac3559caa6b2333504edc068614ab1ce145aa59d6f": "", "5a856a9bef66402a6778afa6bffb6e4707f54f61b6386988ad5869a6": "", "597db7a0534501ff22028b4a90f0a801489f45cc976159100a715e49": "", "763730a4393cda3f037c25bd5d32f89b62504879403a018772e4d5f6": "", "29e17e4f27c9db91f144f1f86644208987ca4c465375e54ae65491b0": "", "48e94d72c489c14282b88feb65ae5afd9b39a0fcaf9b98f55cbf1fa4": "", "b0a4f29d314408a4283661c7ab6e83f482650634d2af9a5fef99ed8f": "", "8847653df7ac7b487f3c2a0d6a02cd6f09d5d6a960f1e5013a25b13d": "", "c97ab39a3925fe558e6853bbe2654059d60064719dee915daeff86e5": "", "2bf0b595c79770cc40bb38896deaac9689a13562fe81e15d6255d9ba": "The world's most polluting companies have a moral and legal obligation to address the harms of climate change because of their role in spreading misinformation, according to an inquiry brought about by Filipino typhoon survivors. Experts say the long-awaited report published on Friday, which concludes that coal, oil, mining and cement firms engaged in 'wilful obfuscation' of climate science and obstructed efforts towards a global transition to clean energy, could add fuel to climate lawsuits around the world. The inquiry by the Philippines Commission on Human Rights began seven years ago after a petition by survivors of Typhoon Haiyan and local NGOs. As well as considering the human rights impacts of climate breakdown in the Philippines, it drew on scientific, legal and personal evidence from around the world to examine the role played by 47 of the world's most polluting companies in the climate crisis. During hearings in Manila, London and New York, the commission heard from survivors of extreme weather disasters who appealed directly to the companies to respect their human rights. It concluded that the world's most polluting companies are morally and legally liable for the impacts of the climate crisis because they have engaged in wilful obfuscation of climate science and obstructed efforts towards a global transition to clean energy. It said they may also be held to account by their shareholders for continuing to invest in oil exploration for 'largely speculative purposes'. The commission called on governments to phase out fossil fuel projects and keep new coal, oil and gas in the ground, provide incentives for renewable energy, and ensure businesses are subject to strong corporate responsibility laws. Yeb Sano, the executive director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia, which helped bring the original petition, said the report was a 'vindication' for the millions of people whose rights were being breached by the companies behind the climate crisis. 'This report is historic and sets a solid legal basis for asserting that climate-destructive business activities by fossil fuel and cement companies contribute to human rights harms. The message is clear: these corporate behemoths cannot continue to transgress human rights and put profit before people and planet.' While the commission does not have the power to hold the companies legally responsible or to fine them, experts hope the report will inform the development of new laws and lawsuits in the Philippines, and the vast body of evidence it has collected will be used by policymakers, lawyers and climate campaigners around the world. Carroll Muffett, the president and CEO of the US-based Center for International Environmental Law, described the result as a watershed moment in climate accountability that built on other recent court lawsuits, such as last year's ruling by a Dutch court that Shell had to cut its emissions by 45% by 2030. He said the commission's conclusion that states are responsible for protecting their citizens from climate-related human rights abuses by businesses 'should send shock waves through the oil industry'. The commission's chair, Roberto Eugenio Cadiz, said it had provided 'every opportunity' to companies under investigation to participate in the inquiry, even travelling to countries where many of the firms had their headquarters, but none took up the offer. Several challenged the commission's jurisdiction over them in writing and argued that climate change was not a violation of human rights. Publication of the report was repeatedly delayed, to the growing frustration of the petitioners, many of whom were also affected by the more recent Typhoon Rai, but they are glad it has finally come out. Sano said the commission set a 'courageous example' for other human rights institutions and governments around the world and called on the incoming Philippine government to adopt its findings.", "59ba556f19de051dff32509d476d41e66bbccfbcf822dca6eb256449": "Arizona water authorities are bracing for additional cuts to the quantity of water supplied by the Colorado River, prompting calls for more aggressive conservation measures to prevent further reductions. Officials in Arizona state predict that these cuts could come as soon as August, the Phoenix NBC Affiliate 12 News reported Friday. These expected cuts stem from the effects of a decades-long megadrought, which has been greatly exacerbated by the climate crisis. Moreover, the Colorado River, which provides water to almost 40 million people, has been imperiled due to decades of overuse. The river's reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, have seen worsening declines in their water levels. Arizona is typically granted 2.8m acre-feet of water from the Colorado River. The US Bureau of Reclamation, which manages water and hydropower in the south-west, declared its first water shortage in 2021; federal mandates and state-based efforts resulted in Arizona leaving 500,000 acre-feet 'behind Hoover Dam' this year, according to AZCentral.com. The Bureau of Reclamation makes mandates based on water levels in Lake Mead, which are determined by upstream disbursements from Lake Powell. The water level in Lake Powell has approached the minimum required to produce hydropower that provides electricity for several million residents, AZCentral.com said. Arizona's department of water resources, and Central Arizona Project (CAP), have insisted that the state must take further measures to save water. Tom Buschatzke, the water department's director, said that if the reclamation bureau predicts further cuts in 2023, 'there should be serious consideration by water providers to start going down that path'. 'Most of the water use is outside the home,' Ted Cooke, CAP Deputy director, reportedly said to 12 News. 'It's in the yard, it's pools, it's plants, it's lawns.' While Arizona water providers have never required residential water reductions, some city governments did curtail their own usage amid a severe dry period in 2004. Buschatzke said that if water from the Rocky Mountain snowpack does not boost the reservoirs in 2023, a more serious shortage could impact Arizona cities' water supplies. 'Look at all of those factors and it's probably time to start doing something at the homeowner level or the business level,' Buschatzke told AZCentral. 'I can't dictate that, but I might urge those folks to consider doing that.' Officials said that Arizona homeowners are not likely to see 'dry taps' anytime soon, as there have been initiatives to store unused Colorado River water in underground aquifers. However, it's possible that cities will consider tapping these reserves for outdoor purposes, which could start depleting them - without any clear path to replenishing the water, AZCentral.com reported. In addition to Arizona, potential water cuts next year could also impact Nevada and Mexico and, eventually, California. 'The gravity of the immediate situation is serious,' Buschatzke, told The Los Angeles Times. 'We expect further significant actions to reduce water use will be required.'", "b660b3eb2cb3b270e7e34ec662cc6690b3ad74114d8718ccca17ced6": "If you want to know who the world's richest man has on speed dial, then a regulatory filing on Thursday provided an insight. Elon Musk announced a score of new backers for his $44bn (PS35.6bn) Twitter takeover, including Oracle tycoon Larry Ellison, the crypto market's leading trading platform, the Qatari sovereign wealth fund and a Saudi prince. If this was Tesla's boss displaying his power network, it was also an admission that - despite recent words to the contrary - the numbers behind his audacious bid do matter. Discussing his offer last month, Musk said: 'I don't care about the economics at all.' For some of Wall Street's biggest banks, Tesla's shareholders and even Twitter users, the economics are very important indeed. The initial funding package behind the takeover, which requires shareholder approval,was initially split into three elements: $21bn in equity, or Elon Musk's own cash; $12.5bn of loans secured against Musk's shares in Tesla, the electric carmaker that he runs; and a further $13bn in loans from a group of seven banks, secured against Twitter itself. That changed on Thursday. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the equity commitment had risen to $27.25bn, helped by a group of 18 investors including Ellison ($1bn), the Binance trading platform ($500m) and Qatar Holding ($375m), an investment arm of the Gulf state's wealth fund. They are putting in $7.1bn, plus a contribution from the Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who also plans to roll his $1.9bn Twitter stake into the deal rather than cashing out. As part of this reshuffle, the loans secured against Musk's 15.7% stake in Tesla have been halved to $6.25bn. The bank loan commitment stays the same. Musk's comment about the economics of the bid, in an interview at a TED conference in mid-April, came before he confirmed hastily put-together funding for a takeover. It was a move that swayed shareholders in Twitter and the company's board, who accepted the bid days later. But the off-the-cuff nature of his comments belie the serious nature of the financial commitments the Tesla tycoon is making. Some experts point to a high-risk structure, regardless of last week's changes - and what it means for the company he is buying. 'Musk hasn't provided a lot of detail about his business plan for the company,' says Jill Fisch, a professor of business law at the University of Pennsylvania. 'Although he has taken steps to reduce his risk by bringing in additional investors, he still has a lot of personal exposure financially, he is paying a high price based on Twitter's existing business model and he has large loans from the banks. Given the size of Musk's personal financial exposure, he will be under pressure to run Twitter to make money, both to manage his own financial risk and to repay the bank financing.' First, let's look at Musk's commitment. Last month he revealed he had sold $8.5bn worth of shares in Tesla since announcing the takeover, presumably to help fund the deal. His stake in Tesla, which forms the core of his wealth, is integral to financing the deal. If you strip out new investors and Prince Talwaleed's stake, plus Musk's own $3.9bn stake in Twitter, he still needs to provide around $14.3bn of equity for the deal. A simple reading of this would be: he owns $155bn in Tesla shares, so contributing just over $14bn should be easy.  But it is not quite as straightforward as that. According to a filing with the SEC, Musk has already pledged 92.3m of his 163m Tesla shares as 'collateral to secure certain personal indebtedness'. Then there is the $6.25bn already pledged for the deal - in an arrangement known as a margin loan, where the borrower could be required to make good any shortfall in the value of the shares that the debt is secured against. Presuming the loan-to-value ratio of 20% in the original margin loan agreement is carried over, this means a further 35.8m shares are tied up. So, looking at Musk's total shareholding, this leaves him with about 35m unpledged shares worth $30bn. In theory, these could be pledged or sold to raise the remaining $14bn of cash needed for the deal. But Musk tweeted on 29 April that he had 'No further TSLA sales planned after today'.  Drew Pascarella, a senior lecturer of finance at Cornell University, says he would be surprised if Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street bank that has played the lead role in the debt financing, had not carried out some form of due diligence on Musk's commitment. 'There is no way Morgan Stanley would have proceeded as they did unless they had looked in Elon's eyes and seen some evidence that he could come up with that money.' The Tesla chief executive has other sources of wealth, including Tesla shares already sold, his SpaceX rocket business and his Boring Company tunnelling firm. He is also in line to receive $20bn worth of Tesla share options (based on Friday's share price), although he cannot cash these in for five years. According to calculations by CreditSights, a credit research firm, the bank financing alone will leave Twitter highly leveraged once the deal is completed. Twitter's gross indebtedness will be nine times its underlying Ebitda - a measure of profit - for 2021, says CreditSights. 'That is very high and certainly not a comfortable amount of leverage,' says Jordan Chalfin, a senior technology analyst at CreditSights. It is against the backdrop of these numbers that Musk has floated ideas such as charging a 'slight' fee for commercial and government users, although it will stay free for casual users.The New York Times also reported on Friday that Musk expects to pay down the $800m-$900m debt interest costs with free cash flow that he expects to grow to $9.4bn by 2028, although in the short term it looks like it will be tight. According to Chaflin, a proxy for Twitter's ability to cover its debt interest would be subtracting Twitter's capital expenditure costs - $1bn last year - from the company's Ebitda. Stock market analysts' forecasts for Twitter Ebitda, according to a Reuters poll, is $1.4bn in 2022 and $1.8bn in 2023. It could be a squeeze.  'The extremely high levels of debt Elon plans to saddle Twitter with come at a high price - investment for growth,' says Cornell's Pascarella. 'A technology company like Twitter needs to invest in itself to continue to innovate and grow. Post deal, most of Twitter's cash flow will be used not for investment, but to service debt.'Speaking about Twitter at a recent conference, Musk said: 'I mean, I could technically afford it.' He can, but some users might have to pay.", "34a17a45ba9e3f975e776a6adb98a042845ee9c163d90a61f53880e9": "A speech by the home secretary, Priti Patel, was disrupted on Friday evening after pro-refugee activists infiltrated a Conservative party 'spring dinner'. Eight young social justice and climate campaigners from Green New Deal Rising disrupted the Bassetlaw Conservative Association Spring Dinner and demanded she drop controversial plans to offshore asylum seekers to Rwanda. As Patel started to address the party faithful, activists stood up, one by one, to condemn the offshoring plans and called on Patel to abandon them. 'As young people wanting to live in a fair and compassionate society, we are disgusted by your treatment of refugees,' said one of the activists, as plain-clothed security personnel appeared swiftly and removed the protesters from the building. Attendees at the Conservative dinner could be heard on video footage of the incident chanting: 'Out, out, out'. The group targets politicians and other establishment figures and disrupts meetings they attend to challenge their stance on social justice and climate change issues. This tactic is becoming increasingly popular among activists. Extinction Rebellion recently disrupted HSBC's AGM singing a variation of Abba's Money, Money, Money, changing the words to 'money, money, money, it's so scummy, in HSBC's world'. Hannah Martin, from Green New Deal Rising, said: 'The plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda is inhumane and will lead to the destruction of people's lives and further harm those people who are seeking safety.' 'Those who stand for climate justice also stand against Priti Patel's cruel plans that demonise people who are escaping terrifying situations as they bear the brunt of the multiple crises of war, poverty and the climate catastrophe. We want Priti Patel to drop the dangerous Rwanda migration plan and provide support and safety for migrants, refugees and people seeking asylum.' The plans to offshore asylum seekers to Rwanda were announced on 14 April and are the subject of several legal challenges. Initially the government suggested that the first removals would take place very soon but the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has now indicated it is likely to be several months before anyone is forcibly removed to the African country. Many asylum seekers have reported being terrified of being sent to Rwanda. A Home Office spokesperson said:'The world-leading Migration Partnership will overhaul our broken asylum system, which is currently costing the UK taxpayer PS1.5bn a year - the highest amount in two decades.It means those arriving dangerously, illegally or unnecessarily can be relocated to have their asylum claims considered and, if recognised as refugees, build their lives there.'

In a written ruling, US district judge James Donato in San Francisco rejected Trump's argument that Twitter violated his right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the first amendment of the US constitution. Twitter and other social media platforms banned Trump from their services after a mob of his supporters attacked the US Capitol in a deadly riot on 6 January2021 . That assault came after a speech by Trump in which he reiterated false claims that his election loss in November was because of widespread fraud, an assertion rejected by multiple courts and state election officials. Trump's lawyers alleged in a court filing last year that Twitter 'exercises a degree of power and control over political discourse in this country that is immeasurable, historically unprecedented, and profoundly dangerous to open democratic debate'. At the time of removing Trump's account permanently, Twitter said his tweets had violated the platform's policy barring 'glorification of violence'. The company said then that Trump's tweets that led to his removal were 'highly likely' to encourage people to replicate what happened in the Capitol riots. Before he was blocked, Trump had more than 88 million followers on Twitter and used it as his social media megaphone.", "434cb632e083b0b44df445cdc6a689a36941a916fb7e03bc7c13b24a": "Spending time in the great outdoors is good for your mental health, according to a growing body of research. For example, getting out and about in forests and parks has been shown to increase happiness and alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. But are the benefits universal? A review paper notes that most studies in this field look at rich, white, western populations, and scientists say this results in an incomplete picture of the health benefits. Carlos Andres Gallegos-Riofrio, of the University of Vermont's Gund Institute for Environment, whose findings have been published in Current Research in Environmental Sustainability, says indigenous populations like those he studies in South America have different relationships with nature to other people. He says it is important to learn how their mental health is affected by this different rapport. Gallegos-Riofro and colleagues at the University of Vermont examined 174 peer-reviewed studies from the last decade and found more than 95% of research was conducted in high-income western nations of the US, Europe and east Asia. Only 4% of studies looked at nations of medium income, such as India, and no low-income countries featured in the studies. Only one study took place in Africa and one in South America. Of the participants whose ethnicity was known, most were white. Rachelle Gould, a researcher at University of Vermont's Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, said: 'There's nothing necessarily wrong with the existing findings, those findings are important, but we have reason to believe they may not apply to the entire population. In order to allow this work to influence sustainability action and to move us towards sustainability, we need to know which of these effects are universal and which are culturally specific.' Making this distinction can lead to fair policy changes, Gould says. The study builds on the concept of 'Weird psychology', a term coined by the evolutionary biologist Joseph Henrich. The acronym refers to how experiments that focus mainly on college students from western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic (Weird) parts of the world cannot allow scientists to draw universal conclusions about human behaviour. 'This research strikingly demonstrates a massive bias in the sampling of global populations towards those that are Weird,' said Henrich, who was not involved in the study. 'This limits our ability to generalise about the phenomenon under investigation.' Henrich said it would be useful to expand research to include more diverse populations and use culturally sensitive tools adapted to the people being studied.", "853aedae345ec6fcba6db373136598dd82073fd61acf09e2ab8f03ac": "Sri Lanka's president has declared a state of emergency for the second time in five weeks, giving security forces sweeping powers as a nationwide strike demanding his resignation brought the country to standstill. A spokesperson for Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he invoked the tough laws to 'ensure public order' after shops closed and public transport was halted on Friday by unions blaming him for the unprecedented economic crisis, which has ignited weeks of unrest. Earlier on Friday, police used teargas and water cannon to disperse students attempting to storm the national parliament demanding Rajapaksa resign. The state of emergency gives powers to security forces to arrest and detain suspects for long periods without judicial supervision. It also allows the deployment of troops to maintain law and order in addition to police. 'The president used his executive powers to invoke emergency regulations to ensure the maintenance of essential services and public order,' the spokesperson said. He said the laws will go into effect from midnight on Friday. Rajapaksa had declared an earlier state of emergency on 1 April, a day after thousands of protesters attempted to storm his private home in the capital. That emergency was allowed to lapse on 14 April. But protests have escalated since then. The new emergency declaration came as thousands of demonstrators remained outside Rajapaksa's seafront office, where they have been protesting since 9 April, and smaller groups tried to storm homes of other key government politicians. The 85,000-strong police force had stepped up security for all ruling party legislators.

Andrew Wilhoite, 40, of Lebanon received 60 of the 276 total votes on Tuesday for Republicans for three positions on the Clinton township board, Boone county election results showed. Wilhoite was arrested in late March in connection with the death of 41-year-old Elizabeth 'Nikki' Wilhoite, whom, the authorities suspect, was killed by a blow from a gallon-sized concrete flower pot, the Indianapolis Star reports. He has been held since then in the Boone county jail without bond, charged with murder. Indiana police allege Andrew Wilhoite struck Nikki Wilhoite in the head with a blunt object, knocking her out. He then put her in a vehicle and drove to a creek a few miles from their home and dumped her body there after dropping it from a bridge, police allege. Police found Nikki Wilhoite's body on 26 March partially submerged in about three feet of water. Court records indicate Nikki Wilhoite filed for divorce on 17 March. The couple had been married for 12 years. Andrew Wilhoite's jury trial is scheduled for 29 August, court records show. If he is convicted of a felony before the 8 November general election, he would automatically be removed from the ballot. No Democrats have filed for the board. 'Under our legal system, every person is innocent until proven guilty,' said Brad King, co-director of the Indiana Election Division. A message seeking further comment was left on Friday by the Associated Press for Wilhoite's attorney. The township board has three members and only three people stood for election.

Some had studied the video frame by frame to identify their loved one. Others knew in an instant that one of the men being murdered in the Tadamon massacre was their family member who had vanished nine long years ago. Ten days after the Guardian revealed the massacre carried out and filmed by Syrian forces in a suburb of Damascus, a fuller picture is emerging of the men who were killed, and unusually outspoken family members are demanding answers of a rattled Syrian regime - which has released a few hundred prisoners in an apparent attempt to quell the outcry. A total of six men shown in their last moments of life in the gruesome video have now been identified. Many were Palestinians from the nearby Yarmouk refugee camp. Several more were local residents. Their families have little clue about why they were captured. But for the first time since the outset of the war, officials are under pressure to provide responses to a seething Syrian street. Regime reaction so far has been to offer concessions; an amnesty law for terrorism offences that did not involve killing, an anti-torture law passed by decree, which many in Damascus feel is almost mocking them, and a new defence minister, who has no ties to the security machine accused of directing the slaughter in Tadamon. The first prisoner release did not go quite to plan, if indeed it was the regime's intent to represent a new benevolent side, when up to 20 men were dropped off from a prison truck in a central Damascus square on Tuesday. Their faces gaunt, skin pallid and eyes staring vacantly into the middle distance, the men looked like human wrecks, pale imitations of the photos held by family members who wept as they received them. All week a vigil ensued, with thousands lining the streets of the Syrian capital waiting for those incarcerated in Bashar's dungeons - in this case, the infamous Sednaya prison on the outskirts of the capital. Family members of the Tadamon victims, meanwhile, were finally able to hold vigils of their own, for men they had long believed were lost in the darkness of Sednaya. Among them were the parents of Wasim Siyam. 'I was expecting everything, that he'd have lost an eye, that he'd have been tortured, but I wasn't expecting that they do this to him, it's the absolutely worst,' his mother told the al-Araby network. 'I thought he was held by the regime. He left the house at 6am. I gave him his clothes, I had them hanging to dry, he wore them and I told him: please don't go. At 12.40 his phone dropped off the cell network. We asked the government for a family record and they had him down as alive. Justice must be served.' Siyam's father told Orient TV he recognised his son by the way he ran: 'My friend who lives in the Netherlands sent me this video and I watched it once, twice, three times and I noticed one of them ran in a familiar way and it was my son.' Siyam was 33 years old when he was murdered and had two daughters, who are now 15 and 13. His father told Orient Radio of having to tell his granddaughters. 'On Monday, on the first day of Eid ... their grandma showed [the daughters] the video and told them: this is your father. I used to lie to them and tell them that their dad was alive and working. One of them would tell me: 'OK but I just succeeded in my exams, isn't he going to come and get me a present?'' A Facebook page, Yarmouk Camp News, carried more news about Siyam. A school friend, Rami Jalbout, who is now a lawyer, said: 'He was hard-working. His grandfather owned the bakery and he used to work in it, he lived above it. He had a very special laugh and was a very kind person.' The next three victims identified were the Turkmen Syrians Shaman al-Daher and his sons, Omar and Mutlaq. Omar and Shaman were identified being executed by family members who refused to provide their names to the website Zaman al-Wasl. They also identified Mutlaq, whom they said was already dead in the pit. Shaman was 63 years old and was arrested with his sons during a raid on his house on 16 April 2013, the day of the massacre. The fifth victim identified was Louay al-Kabra, another resident of the Yarmouk refugee camp, according to the Action Group for the Palestinians of Syria. Louay was a first responder and had been reported missing earlier that month. Said Ahmad Khattab, a barber, 27, was another Palestinian victim from Yarmouk. A friend said on Twitter that he was the grandson of a leader of a 1936 Palestinian revolt against the Ergun. 'Today, 74 years after that massacre, I forced myself to watch this video ... and saw Said the grandson get executed the same way his grandfather was but this time by Arabs who claim they are resistance.' Yarmouk had been long held up by the Syrian regime as a showpiece to its commitment to the Palestinian cause. But regime raids later in 2013 forced most of its residents into exile, some for a second time. Many remain in Lebanon, afraid to return. Prof Ugur Umit Ungor, from the University of Amsterdam's Institute of Genocide and Holocaust Studies, who revealed the massacre along with his colleague, Annsar Shahhoud, said the overwhelming reaction to the revelations had left him feeling ambivalent. 'You don't want to re-traumatise people and cause more suffering, but on the other hand there's no point keeping bad news from people,' he said. 'So it's the lesser evil, that's a thin consolation but it's all I have. 'I cannot and do not want to imagine the feelings of those family members the very moment they saw the video and recognised their loved ones. I just hope this research puts an end to the horrific feeling of endless waiting for a disappeared, and hopefully they can mourn the person now.'", "bf7bbe3b43aeb00e3aae57096a327337a87ec91c63588c9bb7463cbe": "", "2417f5a7a5f56ebad194e2cfcea39bdbcaac2fe66f4581120a0dc43a": "", "50fcb3045adfdc56659b6e93a66a9abeabec8f88803f068f4e6b8744": "", "e9b18b24c3ef415ec535158f29b00544610530018b9926ae7d315eee": "", "70cd7382a2586dc25bc3e1558ee76f6b2f691b8c8817f373e478b4f9": "", "25d243687ef0e1861e1b87cb08f577f10405eb1c75ce2210d558c572": "", "e4aa81a105da682d31b5d334f66486dfdb9f0060778ac0c4a81a72f7": "Dr Tracy Dennis-Tiwary was a professor of psychology, immersed in research - evaluating which mental health treatments worked and why - when she first became aware of an uptick in anxiety. This was some 15 years ago in New York City. 'I work closely with practising clinicians and I remember one of them saying, 'I'm seeing all these parents and kids coming in and they're talking about anxiety the way we used to talk about stress,'' she says. 'Everything is about anxiety.' Back then, Dennis-Tiwary believed treatments would make a difference. 'I thought we were going to claw this back, but the opposite happened.' Instead, that uptick became an avalanche. Today, anxiety disorders are the most common mental health issues in the US, affecting 30% of adults. In the UK, prescriptions for anti-anxiety medications have almost doubled over the past 15 years, with a sharp rise among the under-25s (in the US, says Dennis-Tiwary, prescriptions have quadrupled). In 2021, a survey of 8,000 children led Oxford University Press to name anxiety as the 'word of the year'. 'It's the word on everyone's lips, the challenge of the moment,' says Dennis-Tiwary. 'We have reconfigured ourselves to think of ourselves as an anxious society. We have a million great self-help books, scientifically validated treatments; we have 30 different anti-anxiety meds but the field has not kept pace with the treatment and prevention of physical disease. None of it is sticking. 'I was part of the problem, however well-intentioned, until I started to wake up about a decade ago and began thinking, 'Wait a second. What are we saying to people?' The idea that anxiety is something to manage or eradicate, a habit to be broken, is wrong and actually doing us harm. It's literally a recipe for more anxiety.' This is the central message in Dennis-Tiwary's new book, Future Tense. She concludes that the problem isn't anxiety itself, but our beliefs about it and our attempts to avoid it, which are not only destined to fail, but also to make us weaker and more fragile. It's a vicious cycle. To help reframe anxiety as an ally not an enemy, Future Tense takes a deep dive into the emotion itself. 'Anxiety is very different to fear,' says Dennis-Tiwary. 'Fear is the certainty that something bad is happening to you. Anxiety is about uncertainty; it's the feeling that something bad could happen, but might not. It's the discrepancy between where you are and where you want to be.' So you're anxious about failing your exams. About that lump. Finding your first job. 'Anxiety is designed to feel bad - your heart races, your blood vessels contract - so you sit up and listen,' she says. 'But unlike fear, anxiety contains hope. Our dopamine levels increase - that's the feelgood hormone that happens when we're rewarded.' The distant prospect of acing those exams, of getting a clean bill of health or landing your chosen career is the dopamine talking. Anxiety can focus the mind, drive you to revise harder, to see a doctor, to seek new pathways towards your chosen career. 'It's a horrible emotion, it feels terrible,' says Dennis-Tiwary. 'But it's a beautiful emotion, too.' The key distinction between anxiety and an anxiety disorder is functional impairment - when our ways of coping impede on normal life. Perhaps we stop leaving the house. In cases of obsessive compulsive disorder, we might create rituals to dampen the feelings. Dennis-Tiwary advocates treatments like exposure and response prevention, a cognitive behavioural therapy, which helps patients confront whatever they are anxious about. But her biggest wish is to change our approach at a much earlier stage so that anxiety won't drift into a disorder. 'First, it's the understanding that being anxious is not a malfunction, it's helpful and useful,' says Dennis-Tiwary. 'If you wake up with that feeling, it's worth tuning in and sitting on it for a while. Why are you feeling like this?' She gives the example of her first pregnancy when she learned that her son would require open-heart surgery within months of his birth. Her anxiety was off the scale, but it energised her to do everything in her power to minimise the odds of the worst outcome imaginable. She gathered knowledge from every paper ever published about her son's condition, she found the best possible surgeon, she planned for every contingency. Anxiety helps us forge forwards with creative solutions, but there are times when there is little we can do to address a future uncertainty. Dennis-Tiwary suggests many ways of coping here. Connecting with friends and family is a soothing first step. Cultivating things that immerse you in the present moment is also helpful. 'Mindfulness is one technique, but whatever works for you. Exercise is an incredible way to find flow and bring yourself to the present. Music - whether you perform or listen to it. Walking in nature. I love to write poetry - bad poetry most of the time but it leads me to a state of expansive thinking.' Making a daily to-do list can claw back some sense of control and achievement. The worst possible response is to instead stamp out the feeling or attempt to avoid it. Humans, says Dennis-Tiwary, are 'anti-fragile' - we only strengthen and grow when challenged. 'Our emotional systems are like our immune systems,' she says. 'If our immune system isn't exposed to germs, it remains weak. If our muscles aren't used, atrophy sets in. It's only by feeling our anxiety, listening and acting on it that we cope better next time.' For this reason, Dennis-Tiwary expresses grave concerns over our creeping collective anxiety-avoidance techniques like safe spaces and trigger warnings. 'I think they're counter-productive and so far, the evidence suggests that, too,' she says. 'What they tend to do is inform someone that they're not up to the task and that difficult emotions are harmful.' Snow-plough parenting is another counter-productive development. 'Here in Manhattan, it has replaced the helicopter parent,' says Dennis-Tiwary. 'This removal of obstacles, fixing things before they've happened. I know it's so hard being a parent - it takes everything for me not to step in - but we have to have faith in our kids, acknowledge their emotions, show we have confidence they can figure it out. We need to help them through, not around.' This speaks to me. In 2020, my youngest daughter was the target of some harmful behaviour at her school. She came off her phone. She cut contact with her peers. Within weeks, the schools had closed, too, the country in lockdown and my daughter's anxiety over ever going back or making new friends was sky high. I was so tempted to lift that weight off her back by telling her she never had to. I came close. I thought about moving house. I enquired about other schools. I researched home schooling. But then what? At some point, she'd have to step back into the world. The kids from her school lived all around us. On social media, they'd never be more than a click away. I knew that the best outcome was the hardest - to go back. Strangely, in the months that followed, my daughter used many of the methods outlined in Future Tense. She filled notebooks with lists that she carefully ticked off each day. At first they were basic - 'shower', 'wash hair' - but as she began to follow interests and find meaningful distractions (teenagers without phones have a lot of hours to fill), they became more character-building. 'Meditate'', 'French Duolingo', 'Leg workout with weights.' My own anxieties brought some horrible physical effects - loss of appetite, my clothes stopped fitting - but my mind whirled with ideas, new ways to build her up. Some actually worked. She attended a film course, where she bonded with a girl over a shared interest (still one of her closest friends). Though we weren't going on holiday that summer, I asked a family in Madrid if they knew a teenage girl interested in a fortnight's exchange. My daughter returned from that trip the happiest and most relaxed I'd seen her. At school, it probably took a full year before my daughter felt safe in new friendships. Anxiety brought her to rock bottom, but by sitting with it, getting through not around, she's deeper, stronger and so much wiser. I couldn't be prouder. Like Dennis-Tiwary says, it's horrible, it feels terrible - but it's beautiful, too.

Temperatures peaked at 49C in Jacobabad, Pakistan on 30 April, with a high of 47.2C observed in Banda, India. The Indian Meteorological Department confirmed that average temperatures in April were the highest for northern and central parts of the country since records began over 100 years ago. Heatwaves are a common occurrence at this time of year in India and Pakistan, but scientists believe the intensity, duration and arrival time of the conditions witnessed so far this year are caused by rising global temperatures. Despite a slight respite in the extreme heat over the past few days, temperatures are set to intensify once more this weekend and into next week with maximum temperatures expected to approach 50C in parts of north-west India and Pakistan. In stark contrast to intense heat across northern India and Pakistan, tropical parts of south-east Asia have seen unusually low temperatures for the time of year. On 2 May, the Hong Kong Observatory reached 16.4C. This was the lowest May temperature recorded since 1917, and broke the previous record set in 2013. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou observed a temperature of just 13.7C on the same day, the lowest temperature ever recorded during May. On 4 May, a minimum temperature of 13.6C was also recorded in the Umphang district, Thailand. This is the lowest temperature ever recorded in May in Thailand. The cool weather was a result of a north-east monsoon and unsettled conditions, but these low temperatures won't come as any consolation to northern India and Pakistan with dangerous temperatures expected to return over the coming days. Meanwhile, Australia has seen its first cold outbreak of the year after the seventh warmest April on record. A cold front brought a significant drop in temperature to south-eastern parts of the country on Wednesday with temperatures 4-8C below the average for parts of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania. Heavy rain and strong winds affected Tasmania on Thursday and Friday thanks to a deep area of low pressure. Referred to as an 'east coast low' by meteorologists, these features occur several times a year and can bring some of the most destructive weather conditions, including heavy rain, strong winds and flash flooding.", "0b07356baa958f93f77a9157d8699af0fdb82b9f2615e7ec94bfc4b5": "As Maurice Lewis was granted his freedom at the end of last year, he wept before a judge. 'God bless you,' he told her. 'I'll never do this again. Thank you for putting me back with my family.' Lewis, a 57-year-old man, had been sentenced to life without parole in 1998. He had spent the last 23 years at Angola prison, serving his punishment by laboring on the fields, sweeping the prison hospital wards, and cleaning toilets at Louisiana's state legislature. Life without parole is a sentence so harsh, it is associated with heinous crimes. But not in Louisiana, the most incarcerated state in the world's most incarcerated country. Lewis's crime had been so banal it has never been written about before. He was sentenced in an almost empty courtroom, with no family members present, at the end of a hearing that lasted a few minutes. He had been convicted of stealing $20 in cash from a snatched purse. 'It felt like it was me against the world,' he remembered in an interview. 'They kept on digging over my past.' That the money was returned to the unharmed white woman within minutes of the crime did not matter. Under the state's habitual offender laws, voraciously enforced by the Orleans parish district attorney's office at the time, he had been branded a career criminal. And as this was the third time the state invoked the habitual offender law, he was mandatorily sentenced to life with no chance of release. A glance at Lewis's prior record reveals no career criminal, but a life of struggle instead. He had left school at the age of 14 without learning to read and had taken a few low-paying jobs - delivering newspapers, and dish cleaning at a local hotel to support his mother. His youth had been punctuated by a series of convictions for minor crimes in which no one was physically hurt and a grand total of $44 was taken and later returned. He was involved in the theft of some stereo equipment aged 19. A purse at the age of 21. And at 27, he took an umbrella from a front porch. It was, he recalled, raining that day. Lewis was convicted of burgling an inhabited dwelling and sentenced to 80 months in prison. Using his prior record, the city of New Orleans deemed that Maurice Lewis should die in prison after the final purse snatching offense in 1998, in which he had pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors described him at trial as 'a predator', a racist trope. At the end of September last year, Lewis became one of the first 128 people given back their freedom thanks to a new civil rights division in the Orleans parish district attorney's office. The division was created by the city's new district attorney, Jason Williams, who ran as a progressive reformer and pledged never to use Louisiana's habitual offender statute again. Part of his new civil rights division's work to address past harms has been to revisit excessive sentences. It has since relitigated 82 habitual offender cases, resulting in their sentence enhancement or 'multi-bills' being amended or revoked, and leading to immediate release from prison. Overuse of Louisiana's habitual offender law is seen by many reform advocates as one of the major drivers of mass incarceration in the state. The act automatically increases prison time (from a second felony conviction onwards) and significantly removes the discretion of judges. Their implementation was memorably derided by Louisiana's former supreme court chief justice, Bernette Johnson, in a 2020 dissent after the court denied a request to review the sentence of a man named Fair Wayne Bryant who was sent away for life for the attempted theft of a pair of hedge clippers. Judge Johnson described the law's usage as a 'modern manifestation' of 19th-century Pig Laws, racist statutes designed to criminalize Black people implemented shortly after the US civil war. Nowhere in the state were they as readily enforced as in New Orleans, where prosecutors used them routinely for decades, first at the instruction of former DA Harry Connick and continuing into the tenure of Leon Cannizzaro. Although in recent years the Louisiana state legislature has amended the laws to reduce mandatory sentences and later made it harder for prosecutors to enforce them as vigorously as before, there are still hundreds of people incarcerated, with their sentences enhanced by multi-billing. At the beginning of 2021, at least 718 people from Orleans parish were still incarcerated under sentences extended by the habitual offender statute. Ninety-three per cent of them are Black. In a monumental shift, the DA's office is now working with attorneys in the public defender's office and other non-profit defense groups to sift through the hundreds of names, considering each individually for re-examination on a range of criteria. These include whether the defendant was a juvenile at the time of the offense, if the offense was categorized as non-violent or no violence occurred, if the conviction was secured by a non-unanimous jury or if the defendant had been offered a more favorable plea before trial. During a recent meeting of the civil rights division, Cormac Boyle, one of only two trial attorneys assigned to the unit in its first year, began reading from an extensive list of cases they were preparing to take back to court. It was a sobering monologue:  Life without parole for a non-violent car theft.  60 years for possession with intention to distribute 2.4 grams of cocaine.  20 years for theft of a motorized dirt bike.  40 years for purse snatching. (The man, sentenced in 1986, had almost completed his sentence in full.) The list drew occasional gasps from the assembled attorneys and investigators. Some, like Boyle, have worked for years on similar cases, but the sheer volume of severity has remained striking to almost everyone. 'I get so frustrated by the utter wastage that we see of human life with the kind of sentencing that we are dealing with,' said Emily Maw, chief of the civil rights division. 'It is futile.' A few weeks after his release, Maurice Lewis was struggling. He had been overjoyed as he came out and saw his sister and brother at the gates of Angola waiting to greet him. But the realities of life outside grew day by day. grew  Every relitigated multi-bill case includes a re-entry plan for a defendant's release. But plans do not always become reality. Decades of trauma do not simply wash away. Lewis had first taken up work at a local restaurant, cleaning pots and pans in the kitchen, but, he said, was laid off when his boss found out about his criminal record. Afterwards he had tried to find work downtown, in the bustling tourist hubs on Canal Street. He walked into a number of storefronts asking for a job. The old hotel he'd worked at in the 1980s. A Footlocker. No luck. Lewis had effectively spent his entire adult life incarcerated and the realities of the free world were difficult to adapt to. He had never used a mobile phone. He had no bank account. No driver's license or state ID. He met with family members; aunts and uncles, nieces or nephews who had grown old or grown up during his decades behind bars. It was a confronting reality. He was living with his younger brother Eugene in a small apartment block, but with little space, he was sleeping in the living room. Every morning he woke up facing a life-sized photograph of his mother, Alise, who had died while he was in prison. 'I couldn't even be there to look down on my mama,' he said one recent blustery afternoon. 'Right now, today, it still messes with me.' On some nights, when it got too much, he had wandered the streets alone and slept outside under a bridge. On one occasion, he described being pulled over by police and asked for identification documents that he didn't have. 'At night time it's dangerous,' he said, his deep baritone voice at odds with his slim, slight frame. 'Anything can happen to you.' In conversations, he offered fragments of the abuse he experienced inside: of violence he witnessed, men beaten with padlocks wrapped in socks in the dorms, of a time he recalled being placed in restraints after a breakdown following the death of his mother. 'I just thank God for the blessing, you know? For putting me back out here,' he said one evening in late winter as he ate dinner in the city's French Quarter. 'What they did to me was wrong, using my past record. And I'm just trying ... trying to make it right.' Former New Orleans district attorney Harry Connick, now 96, forcefully defended his office's routine use of the habitual offender laws, arguing it was his experience as a defense lawyer that guided his usage of the statute. 'I represented them [multiple offenders] for years, and I know them,' he said, during an interview. 'I know their criminal histories, and I know that if you give them a year, they come out, they'll go and commit more crime. Give them five years and they come out, they're going to go commit more crimes. That's what they do.' Connick pointed to his office's creation of a diversion program, which deferred prosecution of first-time non-violent offenders, as an effort to steer defendants away from punitive measures. But did he recognize that many of those he was prosecuting under the statute, like Maurice Lewis, were involved in crimes born of poverty and desperation? 'Desperate for what?' He said. 'Money? ... I'm not a social worker. And my job was to prosecute.' 'People used to complain about the number of people I was sending to Angola. I would tell them to stop committing crimes, and I'll stop prosecuting them.' He added: 'For every year that individual, that habitual offender, that career criminal, would spend in the penitentiary, that diminishes the number of crimes that he's going to commit. If you get enough of them in, you're going to help your crime rate tremendously.' Despite Connick's claims, the crime rate in New Orleans soared throughout the 1990s, with experts pointing to a complex mixture of societal forces felt acutely in the city. These include multidimensional poverty, income inequality and the effects of mass incarceration itself. Jason Williams would point to these causes on repeat during his 2020 election campaign. In an interview, he cited his family's experiences with racism and the criminal justice system as a major factor in shaping his views on fair prosecution. Williams's mother grew up in Bogalusa in central Louisiana, a hotbed of KKK activity during the civil rights era. His great uncles were part of the Deacons for Defense and Justice, an armed Black self-defense group that was founded in the town. 'Growing up, I'd see them work on cars and tend to chickens in the yard,' he remembered. 'They just looked like men in overalls. I never thought about them as defenders of anything. 'It painted this picture for me that people who fight for things don't necessarily look a certain way. They don't necessarily get the credit. No sign or marker. Sometimes you've just gotta fight for what's right and go back to raising your family.' Williams was born in New Orleans but moved to Atlanta for much of his youth. He would return to the city in summers and hear stories from his cousins, living in New Orleans's Lower Ninth Ward, of police brutality and unfair arrests. He returned to New Orleans for college, and upon graduation quickly became a star of the criminal defense world and later the city council president. His unexpected victory in the 2020 DA's race shook the city's establishment, but he has since faced criticism on both sides of the political aisle. On the right, he has taken significant blame for rising violent crime rates, which began a year before he assumed office, but continued into 2021 when the city's murder tally rose to 218, the highest since Hurricane Katrina. His office has also been under fire for charging delays, which have led to higher rates of jail release for violent crime suspects. On the left, both his rhetorical and policy response to the crime wave has been seen as a reversal of a number of campaign pledges. Earlier this year, Williams introduced bail bond scheduling, despite pledging progressive reforms to how the office handled cash bail - another major driver of mass incarceration. Following a spate of carjackings, Williams's office has moved to prosecute carjackings as armed robberies meaning longer prison terms. And despite pledging to never prosecute juveniles as adults, Williams indicted two - 15-year-olds for second-degree murder in adult court, following a brutal shooting in the city. It was, he said in a recent interview, one of the hardest decisions he has had to make in office. In the same exchange, Williams reiterated his pledge never to use the habitual offender statute again, and maintained his longstanding criticism of his predecessor's use of it. But, he added: 'When you talk about violent crime, when I ran, I didn't run as a prison abolitionist. There are some people that need jail time. And the jail time should be the appropriate number to hold that person accountable for the harm they cause.' Pointing to his critics on the right who have attempted to associate his tenure with a rise in violent crime, Williams said: 'They would rather blame a reform-minded DA who wanted to make the office more fair. If I took office and I was doing everything the same way as my predecessors I still think there'd be a bit of a double standard. 'I think there are certain folks who are uncomfortable with the fact that the chief prosecutor in a southern state is a dark brown man.' On a bright Sunday morning in spring Maurice Lewis sat in church, his head bent in prayer and his right arm lifted to the heavens. He had come to worship at the Next Generation Original Morning Star, in a congregation made up mostly of formerly incarcerated people. It was his first Sunday service since release. Pastor Tyrone Smith led the worshippers in a rendition of Amazing Grace. It soared to the rafters and had the congregation swaying in time. It reminded Lewis of his mother again. The hymn had been played at her funeral, which he could not attend. Pastor Smith, himself formerly incarcerated, is co-director of the First 72+, a non-profit organization that assists people with re-entry. Lewis had received some assistance from the group, but even now, four months after release, he was struggling to navigate the complex bureaucracy to regain some of the documentation he required to claim income assistance or apply for jobs. There is little to no state assistance for those leaving prison in Louisiana, meaning non-profits like the First 72+ and individual family members shoulder much of the burden assisting those who re-enter society. 'As a country we fail with the whole criminal legal system,' said Jene O'Keefe Trigg, the civil rights division's director of partnerships and development. 'We just completely rip families apart and lock them away from their homes and their families, and then don't give them anything to come home to. It's just such an utter failure, that means we have to do more on the back end.' At the end of last year the division secured a $1m federal grant to assess and bolster re-entry services in the city. 'I think we [the prosecutor's office] have a moral obligation to ensure that New Orleans has as robust of a re-entry landscape as possible because we are rectifying these cases and bringing more people home.' Lewis has tried to remain optimistic ever since his release and drew strength from the hour of church. He aspired to work in a local hospital, a cleaning job perhaps, anywhere surrounded by people, where he could contribute. 'What the man up above did for me, he got that life sentence off me,' he said. 'I just want to press on. Put it to the side. If I don't take it and put it to the side, I'm going back to somewhere I don't want to go. 'He's the reason I'm out here now. He sees me. I'm not invisible.'

Republicans have been heavily favored to retake control of the House and probably the Senate as well, but the court's forthcoming final opinion in the crucial Mississippi case now before it, Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, could alter those predictions. Since the court's draft opinion leaked on Monday night, vulnerable Democrats have made a point to portray themselves as champions of abortion rights. 'My opponent says that overturning Roe v Wade and ending protections for a woman's right to choose is a 'historic victory',' Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democratic senator who is up for re-election in the swing state of Nevada, said on Tuesday. 'I trust women and their doctors to make the healthcare decisions that are best for them - not politicians.' Speaking to reporters on a Thursday press call, Jaime Harrison, chair of the Democratic National Committee, argued that abortion rights will become a critical issue in the November midterms if the 1973 landmark decision in the Roe case is overturned. 'The Republican attacks on abortion access, their attacks on birth control and women's healthcare - these things have dramatically escalated the stakes of the 2022 election,' Harrison said. 'In November, we must elect Democrats who will serve as the last lines of defense against the GOP's assault on our established and fundamental freedoms.' But Republicans have insisted that issues such as record-high inflation and Joe Biden's handling of the US-Mexican border will weigh far more heavily on voters' minds in November. 'Could be wrong, but I'd predict that all those issues that have 60% of Americans [feeling] we are on the wrong track (high inflation, rising crime, the border, etc.) will play a bigger role in the elections [than] a Supreme Court decision on Roe,' Republican strategist Doug Heye said on Twitter. Rather than celebrating the news of Roe's likely demise, Republican leaders have mostly tried to focus on the leak itself, saying it represents a break in court decorum and blaming the incident on Democrats. (It is not known who leaked the draft opinion.) Asked about the court's provisional decision on Tuesday, the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, told reporters: 'You need, it seems to me, a lecture to concentrate on what the news is today. Not a leaked draft, but the fact that the draft was leaked.' Even the de facto leader of the Republican party, Donald Trump, has been hesitant to address the content of the court's decision. The normally verbose former president has not yet released a statement about the draft opinion, although he has commented on the leak when asked by reporters. 'Nobody knows what exactly it represents, if that's going to be it,' Trump told Politico on Wednesday. 'I think the one thing that really is so horrible is the leaking ... for the court and for the country.' Trump's reluctance to address the draft opinion is even more notable considering his three supreme court nominees - Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - all initially voted to overturn Roe, according to the leaked provisional opinion published on Monday night. The former president also promised during his 2016 campaign to select supreme court nominees who would help reverse the landmark 1973 case. Now Republicans stand on the precipice of achieving their decades-long goal, and many of them seem hesitant to declare victory. However, some Republican primary candidates are using the draft opinion to draw a contrast between themselves and their opponents. David Perdue, the Trump-endorsed gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, condemned Governor Brian Kemp's 'bureaucratic response' to the news of Roe's likely reversal. 'I'm calling on Brian Kemp to join me in calling for an immediate special session of the legislature to ban abortion in Georgia after Roe v Wade is overturned,' Perdue said on Thursday. 'You are either going to fight for the sanctity of life or you're not.' Perdue and Kemp will face off in the Georgia gubernatorial primary later this month, providing an early test of how Republican voters feel about the looming end of Roe. But other Americans' thoughts about the matter will not be fully known until November. Meanwhile, new metal barriers went up in front of the marble steps and columns of the majestic supreme court building in Washington DC, close to the US Capitol, this week, a stark symbol of the sudden politicization of the court that has always preferred to keep itself above the partisan fray. This came after fierce protests erupted there within minutes of the leak on Monday, with police separating protesters in rival camps the following day. Now law enforcement officials in many places across the US are braced for potential civil unrest and women's rights groups are planning massive protests in several cities for next weekend to demand the protection of the right to choose in reproductive healthcare.", "0582e6178e920aef3cabeb144bc3d5c096dfe671f143afada9f2fc80": "It was described as the Mona Lisa of the digital world and it came with a connoisseur's price tag: $2.9m (PS2.4m) for the first tweet by Twitter's co-founder. This was March 2021 and non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, were bursting into the mainstream. One year on, an attempt to sell on Jack Dorsey's Twitter debut for $25m was pulled after auction bids topped out at just $14,000 (PS11,350). Explosive growth of NFTs over the past 12 months has levelled off, and may even be in decline, according to analysis of the sector, as attention consolidates around a few of the largest players. The NFT rush in 2021 saw sale after sale of the novel digital assets hit staggering sums. A collection of images by the visual artist Beeple sold for $69m, the main token for the 'play to earn' video game Axie Infinity hit a total value of $9.75bn and Coca-Cola raised more than $575,000 from selling items such as a customised jacket to be worn in the metaverse. The football industry, with former Chelsea star John Terry to the fore, has not been slow to back the craze either. The Dorsey NFT was put up for auction in April by its owner, the cryptocurrency entrepreneur Sina Estavi, who said: 'This NFT is not just a tweet, this is the Mona Lisa of the digital world.' Estavi hoped to raise more than $25m from the sale and offered to donate half his takings to charity. When bids reached just $14,000, he pulled the auction entirely. Non-fungible tokens are so-called because, unlike similar technologies such as bitcoin and ethereum, each is in some way unique. That means that they can be applied to more than just simple currency-style uses, and in the past few years NFTs have been adopted by people seeking to turn art, music, games and trading cards into digital assets. NFTs use a blockchain - the decentralised ledger first used by bitcoin to track ownership of the cryptocurrency - to record who owns them and allow them to be traded or modified. But most are based on the ethereum blockchain, which is maintained through an extremely carbon-intensive system called proof of work. A report published this week by Chainalysis, a blockchain data firm, said collectors have spent $37bn this year up to 1 May, putting them on track to beat the $40bn spent in 2021. However, it said that the 'explosive' growth of the NFT market last year had 'levelled off', with a sharp dip in transactions since February. In other words, the monthly spend on NFTs is no longer rising in leaps and bounds, when it started to take off in the middle of last year. Chainalysis said transaction growth had come in 'fits and starts' since last summer except for two big spikes: the release of Yuga Labs' Mutant Ape Yacht Club collection in August 2021; and a surge in late January this year, likely to have been driven by the LooksRare NFT marketplace. Other beneficiaries of the boom have seen their value collapse during the past few months. Axie Infinity, for instance, was the flagship example of the 'play to earn' sector in gaming. Players could spend thousands of dollars on a Pokemon-style virtual pet, and then play games to win tokens that could be traded for real cash. At its peak, the game redistributed enough money to in effect pay the wages of thousands of players in the Philippines, but as new players dried up, the value of its token - and the rewards - crashed, bringing the market cap of the organisation from $10bn in November to less than $2bn now. A $500m hack in March, attributed to North Korean state-sponsored attackers, has not helped. But some NFT projects have thrived. The most prominent, such as Yuga Labs' Bored Ape Social Club or Proof Collective's Moonbirds, serve as signifiers of membership to an exclusive club of holders, and as the industry has consolidated around a few large players, interest in their releases has skyrocketed. When Yuga Labs released its most recent NFT, a set of 55,000 'otherdeeds' representing ownership of virtual land in a forthcoming videogame, the rush to buy the PS5,000 tokens was so high that the ethereum blockchain was overwhelmed. Transaction fees shot up to more than PS2,500 a trade, affecting not only those trying (and in some cases failing) to buy the otherdeeds, but also anyone else trying to use the ethereum blockchain at the same time. One unrelated trade saw a $25 NFT sold in a transaction that cost more than $3,000 to execute. Ethan McMahon, economist at Chainalysis said: 'The 'blue chip' names like Bored Ape Yacht Club have more price stability than new entrants that may get hot and then fizzle out. I would only caveat this by saying that this isn't new in this space: to date, a select group of popular collections have been the ones to receive the vast majority of activity and, generally speaking, most collections never take off.' The decentralised nature of the NFT market means there are even disputes about the nature of the crash at all. While specific NFTs have lost millions of dollars of value, the health of the industry as a whole depends on who you ask. Tom Schmidt, a cryptocurrency investor, cited data from OpenSea, an NFT marketplace, to argue that monthly sales were only slightly down from a peak in January, while a report from cryptocurrency analysts Kraken suggests that the daily transaction volume on Opensea peaked in September and has halved in the months since. Despite the digital Mona Lisa losing its lustre, NFTs remain a multibillion dollar market.", "079d91cae57a67720037a9353d9d0660c48e04b1a069126c3953b66a": ""}
