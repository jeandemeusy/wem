But just how realistic are these concerns? Here's everything you need to know. What nuclear weapons does Russia have? Russia has the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, although it has cut down on its supplies since the Cold War. The Nuclear Threat Initiative claims that, as of 2022, the country has approximately 6,257 warheads. It also has both smaller tactical weapons along with larger strategic missiles. Tactical nuclear weapons vary in size and strength, but - in the very unlikely event Russia does start to use its nuclear supply - Moscow will probably deploy these first. They can be one kiloton (the equivalent to 1,000 tonnes of explosive substance) while the larger ones can go up to 100 kilotons. Russia's largest strategic weapons are believed to be at least 800 kilotons. For context, the atomic bomb that killed around 146,000 people in Japan during Second World War was 15 kilotons. But, it's important to note that the impact from each of these weapons would depend on the size of the nuke, how far above the ground it detonates and the surrounding area. Aside from Russia, the US, the UK, China, France, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea are all known to have nuclear weapons. Russia - along with the US, UK, China and France - also signed the 1968 Treaty of Non-Proliferation promising to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. What has Putin said about the weapons? Putin has been holding his nuclear arsenal over the West ever since he launched his attack on Ukraine, and has claimed that Russia is 'one of the most potent nuclear powers and also has a certain edge in a range of state-of-the-art weapons'. The country's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov then warned in April that the risk of nuclear war was 'considerable' because the West continues to supply Ukraine with weapons, even though the West has done this since the invasion began. Russia has also repeatedly promised that its nuclear weapons will be used 'exclusively as a means of deterrence', although it's not entirely unclear what would qualify as a provocation to Moscow. Why would Putin deploy them now? The invasion has not gone to plan Russia's invasion of Ukraine has definitely not gone as smoothly as the Kremlin originally planned. The Russian forces' attack has been barbaric and caused millions of Ukrainians to flee. But, with skyrocketing losses and no real victory in any part of Ukraine,  the strength of the nation's resistance continues to take Russia by surprise. The West is teaming up Putin's invasion was at least partially motivated by his fears that the West, particularly Nato, was uniting against him. Since his invasion, Ukraine has decided to step back from the defence organisation. However, Finland - which also shares a border with Russia - has announced it plans to join Nato as soon as possible.  Sweden is considering it as well, despite being neutral historically.  The West appears to be doing the exact opposite of what Putin supposedly wanted and is coming together.  The UK also went further than any Western country and pledged to send troops to Sweden if it comes under attack from Russia on Wednesday. The deputy chairman of the security council, Dmitry Medvedev, said on Thursday that as Nato is still sending weapons to Ukraine, it 'increases the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between Nato and Russia'. Such a conflict, he claimed, could turn into a 'full-blown nuclear war'. Russia's isolation The sanctions in the West are starting to have a real impact on Russia, as prices rise and goods are harder to buy. On top of that, the West is gradually severing its ties with the country's oil and gas industries. Even Germany revealed on Thursday that it believes it can cope with a boycott of Russian gas by this winter, despite being previously reliant on the export. But do people think Putin will actually use them? Director of national intelligence in the US, Avril Haines, warned on Tuesday that defeat in Ukraine could lead to an escalation of tensions. While she clarified that the Russian president is not expected to use a nuclear weapon unless he saw an existential threat to Russia or regime, there is a chance that losing in Ukraine could fall into such a category. Haines said: 'The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means, including imposing martial law, reorienting industrial production, or potentially escalatory military actions to free up the resources needed to achieve his objectives as the conflict drags on, or if he perceives Russia is losing in Ukraine.' However she added that she expects there to be some form of 'signalling beyond what he's done thus far before' if he were seriously considering it. Former US under-secretary of defence for policy, Walter Slocombe, also told the US think tank Atlantic Council: 'There is some non-zero (perhaps a worryingly high 1 or 2%) risk he will carry out his threats.' Not everyone is as concerned though. When Russia moved to put its nuclear deterrent on high alert, defence secretary Ben Wallace dismissed it. He said the move was an attempt to distract 'the world and the public from what he's actually doing in Ukraine'. Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said at the end of April: 'This only means Moscow sense losing hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine.' According to nuclear expert James Acton, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in the US, Putin would use the weapons only to 'terrify everyone and get his way'. Ukraine is also very close to Russia, geographically, and Putin claims the two are one country, meaning the use of a nuke is a high risk move for the Kremlin. Although the Russian leader has crossed lines before (see: invading Ukraine) others such as Kings College London's nuclear expert Dr Heather Williams think that Kremlin's dependence on China would deter such a drastic move. Speaking to the BBC, she said: 'China has a 'no first use' nuclear doctrine. So if Putin did use them, it would be incredibly difficult for China to stand by him. If he used them, he would probably lose China.' What would happen if Russia did use nuclear weapons? In the unlikely event Putin were to use his nuclear power, experts believe he would deploy the weapons in Ukraine and they would be used against the military rather than civilian targets. Former senior staff member for the National Security Council in the US, Jan Lodal, told the Atlantic Council: 'The sequence would look like this: Putin would first create a 'provocation', then hit a high-value target such as Kyiv in hopes of getting Ukraine to accept 'peace at any cost'. 'However, he would also seek to avoid any potential spillover, such as radiation, into any NATO state.' However, it's not clear how the West would respond to a nuclear attack. The UK and its allies would probably want to avoid escalating the situation, but how authority in the face of Putin's dangerous actions at the same time. So far, US intelligence suggests there has been no significant change in Russia's storage of weapons, so they are not deployed and ready to fire. As nuclear expert James Acton told the BBC: 'Once you have crossed the nuclear threshold, there is no obvious stopping point. 'I don't think anyone can have any confidence of what that world would look like.' ",

The foreign secretary told European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic that the bloc needed to budge during a 'tetchy' phone call this morning. She said a failure to do so would leave the UK with 'no choice' but to tear up the agreement on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But in response, Sefcovic said the EU had moved as far as it could and would be making no further concessions. He said: 'The EU cannot solve all the problems created by Brexit and the type of Brexit that the UK chose. 'That is the reason why the EU's position has been consistent: we will not renegotiate the protocol, and the EU is united in this position. 'Unilateral action, effectively disapplying the protocol, is not a solution for the way forward.' He said the commission 'stands ready' to carry on working for a joint solution to the frictions being caused by the accord, and urged the UK 'to do the same'. The UK insists the Protocol, which created a customs border in the Irish Sea, must be radically redrawn in order to protect the Good Friday Agreement and restore power-sharing government at Stormont. If no agreement is reached, legislation over-riding parts of the Protocol is set to be introduced by ministers next week - a move which could trigger a trade war between the UK and EU. In a statement issued after the call between Truss and Sefcovic, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: 'The Foreign Secretary outlined that the UK's overriding priority is to protect peace and stability in Northern Ireland and said that the Northern Ireland Protocol had become the greatest obstacle to forming a Northern Ireland Executive. 'She also noted that the current situation was causing unacceptable disruption to trade and had created a two-tier system where people in Northern Ireland weren't being treated the same as everyone else in the UK. 'She reminded Vice President Sefcovic of the importance of defending the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement, and said that the commission bore a responsibility to show more pragmatism and ensure the protocol delivered on its original objectives.'",

Earlier this year, MPs voted to force ministers to release documents about the prime minister's involvement in the appointment. But in response, the government has simply released the blank form Lord Lebedev was required to fill in by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. It has also published the public citation announcing his appointment, a list of the other peerages awarded at the same time, and a letter congratulating him on the news. Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, said: 'This looks like a cover up and smells like a cover up because it is a cover up.' It followed questions as to whether the PM asked anyone in the security services to reconsider or withdraw their assessment of Lord Lebedev ahead of his appointment in November 2020. Lord Lebedev is the owner of the London Evening Standard and a shareholder in The Independent. His father, the oligarch Alexander Lebedev, was a former KGB agent. In a statement, Cabinet Office minister Michael Ellis said the government was 'committed to openness and transparency'. But he said it had to take into account security concerns as well as the need to maintain the 'integrity' of the honours system. 'It is also the case that when considering requests for information from parliament, the government has a responsibility to consider whether it is in the public interest to place information into the public domain,' he said. 'As laid out in today's House of Commons paper, the disclosure of these documents reflects the need to protect national security, to maintain integrity in the system for the awarding of honours and dignities by the Crown, the vetting of nominees for probity and the data protection rights of individuals.' Ellis added: 'Lord Lebedev is a man of good standing. No complaint has been made about his personal conduct. He has been vocal in his criticism of the Putin regime.' Rayner said: 'If the prime minister is claiming he was not involved in forcing through the award of a peerage to an individual of concern to our intelligence services, he should come clean and publish the documents as Parliament instructed. 'The public have a right to know the truth about Boris Johnson's interference in the appointment of his friend Lord Lebedev, the son and business partner of an ex-KGB agent, to a seat in the heart of our parliament. It is time to get to the bottom of this whole murky business.'",

That's because waiting times are ridiculously long at the moment and some mums are sharing the advice they wish they knew before they had children.  One mum, author Libby Page, says her ultimate parenting advice would be to arrange childcare before the baby is here, so you have nothing to worry about when you want to go back to work. It does depend on the area you live in as some might be in high demand, while others may require a deposit before securing a place, but the general advice it to book it during pregnancy.  Don't forget that many parents register their baby on a waiting list as soon as they're expecting, which means places will go quickly.  Others replied to the thread sharing the difficulties they've had accessing childcare, even when they started extremely early. When should I start my childcare search? According to the Baby Centre, you should start looking during your pregnancy.  They say don't worry if you're unsure whether you'll return to work full-time or part-time, or even at all. Making enquiries as early as you can means you'll be armed with all the information you need to make a decision when the time comes. When do I need to make a decision about childcare? In areas where there's high demand, you may need to secure a childcare place for your baby before they're born or shortly after. However, in most cases you won't need to decide this early. It depends on the kind of childcare you want. According to Baby Centre, these can be   Day Centres which have a waiting list, so be prepared to put your child's name down up to six months before you need the place. You may need to pay a deposit or booking fee.   Childminders usually need to be booked at least a month in advance. However, it's worth making enquiries well before this as demand can vary.   A nanny may take time to find, so start your search at least several months before you need one. You'll need to interview as many nannies as possible to find the right one, and then trial them before they start.   They advise drawing up a list of your first, second and third childcare choices. That way you'll be well informed about your back-up choices, just in case your favourite doesn't work out. The earlier you start, the better.",

The star and mother of three, who found fame as a teenager in the Disney Channel's Lizzy McGuire, is posing nude.  'Who cares?' we hear you say. Well, a lot of people, actually.  Though some are championing the beauty of her photos, others are questioning if it was really necessary for her to get naked.  The pictures have clearly caused a division, but do we always need to have an opinion on what women do with their bodies? Whenever a woman chooses to get naked, there's always a discussion around it. Of course no celebrity is exempt from critique, but why do we always feel the need to comment on their choices? Women have the freedom to be able to do what they want with their bodies, when they want.  The commentary hasn't even stopped with the nudity thing, with people bringing Duff's age into the conversation, even when it sounds like a compliment. Call it Lizzie McGuire fans who can't believe it's been almost two decades since their favourite show wrapped, but suggesting Duff has 'aged like fine wine'? (FYI, she's only 34). Readers are also chewing over the contents of the interview inside the cover. The article focuses on Duff growing to accept her body and rejecting 'Hollywood's standards'. 'I'm proud of my body. I'm proud that it's produced three children for me,' she says. 'I've gotten to a place of being peaceful with the changes my body has gone through. I also want people to know a makeup artist was there putting glow all over my body and someone put me in the most flattering position.' This is all good news - we're happy for Duff, who's spoken about struggling with an eating disorder when she was 17. And we also applaud her honesty about the way these cover shoots work. It's the framing that people have questions about. After all, this is a regular, cis-bodied, slim white woman. And as many have pointed out, Duff can celebrate her body without it being held up as an example of rejecting 'Hollywood's standards'.  Lizzie McGuire might be all grown up, but the way we talk about women's bodies has barely changed in decades.",
    "1213545f89f289c3ad69912383d742caaad528a132514188ce665f85": "A senior Tory MP has called on Rishi Sunak to reject calls for a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies to help tackle the cost of living crisis. Andrew Bowie, a former Conservative Party vice-chairman, told HuffPost UK the move would lead to job losses in the North Sea. The West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine MP said it was the 'consensus view' among all of his Scottish colleagues that a windfall tax was a bad idea. His comments came as it was reported that the chancellor had ordered Treasury officials to assess the impact of a windfall tax, amid growing speculation the government will bring one in. The government has repeatedly rejected calls from Labour and the Lib Dems for a one-off levy on the bumper profits being enjoyed by energy firms due to the global spike in oil and gas prices. However, Sunak today left the door open to bringing in a windfall tax unless the companies use their extra cash to increase investment in things like green energy. 'These companies are making a significant amount of profit at the moment because of these very elevated prices,' he told the BBC.  'What I want to see is significant investment back into the UK economy to support jobs, to support energy security, and I want to see that investment soon. If that doesn't happen, then no options are off the table.' But Bowie told HuffPost UK: 'Scotland's economy would be damaged most by a windfall tax. 'I'm of the belief that any windfall tax would hamper investment and cause uncertainty in the North Sea. 'BP and Shell could swallow it given the size of their operation, but medium-sized businesses would find it difficult. Any change to the fiscal framework could lead to jobs being lost and a lack of investment. 'It gets raised with me by these firms all the time. They are firmly against it and I agree with them. 'Every time I meet with the chancellor I raise it with him. He says he is looking at a variety of options, but I very much hope it is not a windfall tax. 'The last time I spoke with the chancellor he was of the opinion that a windfall tax was not his favoured option and I hope that is not the direction he is heading in.' Asked about the government's position on a windfall tax today, the prime minister's official spokesman said: 'We do keep options on the table - rightly so. 'But, as the prime minister has set out, as the chancellor has said, we do not think this is the right approach. 'We want these companies that are making profits to make further investments. But we are simply not cutting off options given the circumstances that we find.'",

Bosses have announced they have recast the role of Francesca Bridgerton ahead of filming starting this summer.  Hannah Dodd will take over the role from previous actor Ruby Stokes, who has now left the show.  Francesca is the sixth-eldest Bridgerton sibling, and made a handful of appearances in the first two seasons.

The Mysterious Girl singer was mentioned in court as Rebekah was quizzed this week about a 2004 newspaper interview she gave about a purported sexual encounter with Peter. The article carried the headline 'Peter's hung like a small chipolata, shaved, slobbery, lasts five minutes,' with Rebekah now admitting she was 'forced into a situation by my ex-husband' to do the interview. Responding to comments about his anatomy being discussed in court, and subsequently in the media, Peter shared a two-minute video on his social accounts revealing he felt like he 'had to say something'.  'Sorry to Emily [his wife] and the children that have had to see and hear some not very nice things,' he wrote in the caption, before going on to say in the video: 'Seeing as I haven't had much of a say in this, and just let everyone have a laugh and whatever, whatever, I'm just going to put it out.  'Fifteen years this has been going on, and I kept quiet and I didn't say anything, and I let everyone have their laugh and I let everyone say what they wanted to say. 'Okay yes, now, [Rebekah] has gone to court and admitted that the story was made up, and she did that because her ex-husband forced her to do it. Fair enough. 'But put that all aside and just think how it feels that if a man, or if I had said this, about her anatomy, or a man said something about a woman's anatomy, and made up something, whatever, I don't know - you can use your imagination - of saying something very unflattering.  'There would be outrage, there would absolute outrage. But because it's been said about me, it's been the butt of all jokes, I've taken it for fifteen years.' He continued: 'Some of you are gonna go, 'oh get over it, don't say anything, whatever'. You've got to understand, what's even worse is it's brought up in a High Court, and the lawyer is bringing it up... and it's brought up again. And the only one that sits there and takes hit after hit about it is me. 'And I'll be laughing about it for a while, but think about how it would feel if it was the other way around, that's all I'm saying.  'Okay yes, I think we all know now it's just a made-up story fine, fine, fine. But it's a little bit more serious than that. And I think it's not fair that something like this can happen again and again and again. 'We talk about all sorts of things, about mental health, about being kind and about all that sort of stuff, and nothing seems to change.' The high-profile libel battle comes after Coleen accused Rebekah's Instagram account of being behind the leaking of 'false stories' about her private life to the media in October 2019. Rebekah, who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, denies leaking stories to the media and is suing her fellow footballer's wife for libel, while Coleen is defending the claim on the basis her post was 'substantially true'.",

    "62a2a2f97a5613bb652aacdbbb9826b5ec8d06028b7272cfa38b0aca": "Cabinet ministers ignored difficult questions from a journalist on Thursday just after the police confirmed it has now issued more than 100 partygate fines.  Boris Johnson, his wife and chancellor Rishi Sunak were all fined for attending a birthday party in June 2020 only last month. This was during the first wave of 50 fixed penalty notices issued in the Met's ongoing investigation into Downing Street's Covid breaches. As that number has now more than doubled, the government is coming under further scrutiny. As Johnson decided to hold a cabinet meeting on Thursday Stoke-on-Trent, Sky News' Sam Coates caught the ministers on their way to the gathering - and he didn't hold back. Addressing home secretary Priti Patel, he said: 'Are you embarrassed or are you just going to play deaf to the scale of the law-breaking in No.10. Do you still back the prime minister?' She avoided looking at the camera, briefing saying, 'good morning Sam' and asking the journalist how he is - all the while keeping her gaze steadily on the ground. Michael Gove was up next. He looked directly at the journalist as Coates asked: 'Is it just best to ignore law-breaking in Downing Street Mr Gove, or do you have the full confidence [in] the prime minister?' With a large smile, the levelling up secretary looked at the camera and said: 'Hi Sam!' As Sunak approached, Coates said: 'Chancellor, are you prepared to dig deep to help with the cost of living or is the prime minister going to bounce you into spending more?' The chancellor simply smiled and said, 'morning', before walking on. It wasn't just the cabinet minister who faced a grilling either. When Guto Harri, Downing Street's director of communications, arrived with a crowd of colleagues, Coates asked: 'Guto Harri, is it hard to spin your way out of this one after a hundred fines this morning confirmed by the Met?' Smiling, the spin doctor replied: 'Good morning! How are you?' Nigel Adams - cabinet minister without portfolio - was also filmed arriving for the meeting, prompting the Sky News journalist to ask: 'Have you fixed it for Boris Johnson to get through this despite the scale of law-breaking in No.10?' 'It's great to see you too, Sam,' Adams replied without breaking his stride. 'Wonderful to be here in Stoke.'  Adams actually tweeted about Labour leader Keir Starmer only last week when he was accused of avoiding scrutiny about 'beergate', which is now also under police investigation for breaching Covid rules. He wrote: 'It's not a good look to be dodging questions about #beergate. 'Most voters can spot BS and a #hypocrite from a mile away.' Coates also tweeted clarifying that not all attendees chose to enter the building, where the government will be trying to follow up on its promises from the Queen's Speech, via the TV cameras.",
    "b88e8088dfad8cdcc5b87ac21376cb761494113d0121627098492769": "More than half of patients who were hospitalised with Covid during the pandemic still experience at least one symptom two years after their first infection, according to new findings. In the longest study of its kind, research published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine has revealed that even after being discharged, these Covid patients still experience a lower quality of life and poorer health compared to the rest of the general public. Lead author Professor Bin Cao from the China-Japan Friendship hospital said: 'Our findings indicate that for a certain proportion of hospitalised Covid-19 survivors, while they may have cleared the initial infection, more than two years is needed to recover fully.' The research is particularly eye-opening because the long-term effects of contracting Covid have been, for the most part, unknown until now. The longest study before this looked at patients for around 12 months. How was the study conducted? The experts looked at how 1,192 patients who had acute Covid and were hospitalised in Wuhan (the Chinese province where the disease first broke out) between January 7 and May 29 2020. The patient's average age at discharge was 57. The study then checked in with the individuals at six months, 12 months and two years.  They had to take part in a six-minute walking test, lab tests, questionnaires on their symptoms, mental health, quality of life linked to their health, and if they had gone back to work along with their use of healthcare facilities. For comparison, there was a control group of people who had no history of Covid infection. What did the study find? Half a year after the initial infection, 68% of patients reported at least one long Covid symptom. Two years later, this number dropped to 55%, with 31% reporting fatigue and muscle weakness. Around 11% of the individuals in the study had still not returned to work. The participants were also more likely to report other symptoms including joint pain, palpitations, dizziness and headaches along with extra pain, discomfort, anxiety and depression compared to the control group. Professor Cao said: 'Ongoing follow-up of Covid-19 survivors, particularly those with symptoms of long Covid, is essential to understand the longer course of illness, as is further exploration of the benefits of rehabilitation programmes for recovery. 'There is a clear need to provide continued support to a significant proportion of people who've had Covid-19, and to understand how vaccines, emerging treatments and variants affect long-term health outcomes.' But the findings are not concrete As all individuals involved in the study were treated at Jin Yin-tan Hospital, it's not clear what variants they were infected with. The impact of the virus on an individual's health is thought to vary according to which strain they were infected with - new data has even suggested that Omicron is less likely to trigger long Covid than Delta. Many of the symptoms in the study were self-reported too, meaning there is a chance of information bias. How many people have long Covid in the UK? According to Office for National Statistics, around 1.3 million living in private households experienced self-reported long Covid symptoms as of January 2022. This means more than four weeks after their suspected infection, people are still experiencing Covid symptoms, particularly fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of smell and loss of taste. The prevalence of it is greatest in people aged between 35 and 69 in particular women, people who live in more deprived areas, those who work in health care, social care, teaching and education, or those with another underlying health condition. Is the rate of new Covid cases in the UK dropping? New infections in the UK were steadily falling but have now plateaued. The ZOE Covid Study predicts that UK cases will stall around 100,000 per day. Professor Tim Spector, co-founder of the ZOE app, said: 'It is too early at this stage to know what is causing the slowdown but it's a strong signal that Covid is not going to disappear for summer.' However, the number of hospital patients in England with Covid has dropped to below 10,000 in the UK, suggesting infections are not causing such severe symptoms at the moment.",

'The rights related to menstrual health have never been discussed and the data is chilling,' Rodriguez told a Spanish news website. 'One in four women cannot choose the feminine hygiene products she wants to buy for financial reasons. That is why we propose that they can be dispensed free of charge in educational and social centres.' While not everyone who gets periods will suffer from debilitating symptoms, there are some who experience extreme pain which can be a sign of health conditions such as dysmenorrhea and endometriosis. But the provisions are to be reserved for extreme pain. Rodriguez added: 'It is important to clarify what a painful period is, we are not talking about a slight discomfort, but about serious symptoms such as diarrhoea, severe headaches, fever. 'Symptoms that when there is a disease that entails them, a temporary disability is granted, therefore the same should happen with menstruation and that there is the possibility that if a woman has a very painful period, she can stay home.' Other countries around the world also offer a similar package to menstruating women including Japan, Indonesia, South Korea, and Zambia. So, should the UK be next? And what does it mean for women in the workforce?  While leave that accommodates different needs is certainly welcome, period leave might still perpetuate period stigma. In fact, research shows young women are being subjected to verbal abuse and bullying around their periods, with many of those affected suffering in silence. One in five (20%) of 14-21 year olds has experienced teasing around their periods and made to feel shame, with only half (49%) telling anyone about it. This teasing and bullying often takes place in school - but for one in 10 girls, it has happened online.  Many people have also been missing school and work due to periods, missing out on their work as a result.  Research published in the BMJ in 2019 found 13.8% of women who have periods had missed work or school because of it - but most felt unable to be honest about the reason. Among those who'd called in sick, only 20.1% told their employer or school that their absence was due to menstrual complaints. In Japan, they've considered introducing period badges to alert work staff that a person is menstruating.  But the move faced backlash as it segregates workers and others those who have periods.  It could also lead to discrimination in the workforce, with bosses and companies hiring fewer women over fears of them going on period leave. So what do women need?  Emma Barnett, journalist and author of the book Period told HuffPost: 'I don't think this helps.'   'Women don't need a badge. They need the voice to vocalise any issues their periods present. They also need others - loved ones and colleagues - to rid themselves of their unnecessary and ill-founded squeamishness about a perfectly normal bodily process.' That might certainly be a start. ",
    "7e97bd1bf25bdccba6af8c4ced2cdfccd74f8c723fb1234ecdb35030": " Liz Truss today fired a warning shot to the EU that she is poised to tear up the Northern Ireland Protocol unless they budge in talks.  The Foreign Secretary held what sources described as a 'tetchy' phone call with her European Commission counterpart Maros Sefcovic this morning.  Truss called for the EU to show 'more flexibility and pragmatism' following long-running negotiations. Prior reports suggested she was set to warn Brussels they had just 72 hours to change their position on NI border checks or the UK government would unveil legislation to override the protocol.  The protocol is part of the UK government's Brexit deal that keeps NI aligned with the EU single market for goods as a means of retaining an open Irish border. However, it has resulted in additional checks for goods moving between Great Britain and NI and plunged the region into political crisis.  In a statement, issued after their high stakes call, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: 'The Foreign Secretary noted this with regret and said the situation in Northern Ireland is a matter of internal peace and security for the United Kingdom, and if the EU would not show the requisite flexibility to help solve those issues, then as a responsible government we would have no choice but to act.' Shortly after, Sefcovic also issued a statement saying it was 'simply not acceptable' for the UK to threaten to unilaterally suspend parts of the protocol. Britain has been preparing legislation that would unilaterally override parts of the protocol - which the EU has warned would result in the suspension of the entire Brexit deal. During the call, Truss also made clear the UK's 'overriding priority' was to protect peace and stability in Northern Ireland. She told Sefcovic the protocol had become 'the greatest obstacle' to forming a new NI executive. After last week's elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the DUP has refused to enter into a new power sharing administration with Sinn Fein unless there are significant changes to the protocol which governs post-Brexit trading arrangements. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: 'The Foreign Secretary outlined that the UK's overriding priority is to protect peace and stability in Northern Ireland and said that the Northern Ireland Protocol had become the greatest obstacle to forming a Northern Ireland Executive.  'She also noted that the current situation was causing unacceptable disruption to trade and had created a two-tier system where people in Northern Ireland weren't being treated the same as everyone else in the UK. 'She reminded Vice President Sefcovic of the importance of defending the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement, and said that the commission bore a responsibility to show more pragmatism and ensure the protocol delivered on its original objectives.' Sefcovic said: 'It continues to be of serious concern that the UK government intends to embark on the path of unilateral action. 'I am convinced that only joint solutions will work. Unilateral action, effectively disapplying an international agreement such as the protocol, is simply not acceptable.' ",

The British actor plays Charlie Spring in Hearstopper, which has proved hugely popular since its debut on the streaming platform last month. While Netflix is yet to confirm whether the hit teen drama will get a follow-up season, its huge viewership would certainly suggest there could be one in the pipeline, with Joe now sharing what he would want to explore in the next chapter. 'I'm excited for [Charlie and Nick],' Joe told British GQ. If we get another season (fingers crossed), I'm looking forward to seeing how they develop as a couple.' He continued: 'In the next graphic novel, Charlie struggles with his mental health and I'd love to explore that more. 'I think a lot of mental health and eating disorder shows tackle mental health in a way that is hard-hitting and really dark, but I'd love to come at these issues from a lighter place.' Meanwhile, in another interview with Variety, Joe also shared his casting hopes for the next instalment of Heartstopper.  'Jennifer Coolidge should play my grandmother,' he said. 'That would be so cool. I love her. She's amazing. 'I also want a scene with Nick's mum so I can work with Olivia Colman.' Heartstopper is available to stream on Netflix now.",
    "5eecdac0b0fdc0473aa4bd2fd03aaa3a2dc16202c486d57fa5761b06": "Tory MP Lee Anderson has doubled down on his controversial comments that people use food banks because they can't 'cook or budget'. The Conservative for Ashfield triggered an online outcry after he made a speech in the Commons on Wednesday saying a large portion of food bank users simply need to taught these basic skills - despite the crippling cost of living crisis which means millions are skipping meals. On Thursday morning, he defended his claims and told Times Radio that a lot of people out there would be able to stop using food banks with the 'right support and the right education'. He added: 'The point I was trying to make was I think the actual food bank use is exaggerated.' Anderson said he works with a local food bank in Ashfield and they've got a 'wonderful initiative' where people receive one food package but have to sign up to a cooking course along with a budgeting course at the same time. The MP also claimed that he was able to make 170 meals for PS50 by cooking from scratch, using fresh vegetables and meat from the local supermarket while batch cooking. He said this would feed a family of five for a week and a half - suggesting the 'real nub of the problem' is the 'generations of people out there who simply haven't got the skills to 'budget properly'. Referring to the backlash from his remarks in the Commons, he said: 'I'm sort of glad it caused all this fuss because it brings that debate out.' He then claimed he had invited all Labour MPs to join part in these courses and 'as yet not one has accepted'. Anderson said until people had attempted the cooking course in Ashfield, 'you've got no right to comment' on his remarks. 'This not me being a nasty Tory,' Anderson claimed. The MP did then clarify: 'There's always genuine people, Stig, in need. I wasn't making that point. 'The point I was making is that there's a lot of people out there who with the right help and the right support and the right education they will be able to fend for themselves.'  However, shadow communities secretary Lisa Nandy suggested Anderson's comments show the Tories are 'living on another planet'. Speaking to Sky News, she said: ''We've got, at the moment, a crisis that is engulfing families and businesses across the country, record inflation - it's not that people aren't budgeting properly, it's that they simply cannot afford the basics. 'And is a damning inditement of 12 years of a Conservative government.' She said there was a food bank in Wigan which was now giving out 'cold boxes' because people can't actually afford to cook the food they're being given. The Labour MP called for significant government intervention to ease the crisis, explaining: 'We've got to get help to people now, we've got to get money back in their pockets, and most of all we have to stop with this sort of patronising rubbish that this is somehow the fault of families who have seen their income drop dramatically in the last few months.'",
    "8d667c1991ee68aed08345dec8610bda1d09e7f7d0c29bcdfde86b62": "Scotland Yard has announced it has issued more than 100 fines for covid lockdown breaches as part of its partygate investigation.  The police had been waiting for the local elections to be over before revealing its latest round of fixed penalty notices for gatherings held in Downing Street and Whitehall during lockdown. Previously, the Metropolitan Police had confirmed that 50 fines had been issued over partygate. In a statement, the Met said: 'As of Thursday 12 May, Operation Hillman, the investigation into breaches of Covid-19 regulations in Whitehall and Downing Street, has made more than 100 referrals for fixed penalty notices (FPNs) to the ACRO Criminal Records Office. 'These referrals have continued to be made throughout the period since our last update on Tuesday 12 April and the investigation remains live.' Boris Johnson is not thought to be among those given one of the additional fines. The prime minister, his wife and chancellor Rishi Sunak have previously received fixed penalty notices for attending a birthday party for the PM in 10 Downing Street. A Downing Street source said: 'If the PM receives a further FPN we will let you know, as we always have.' Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said: 'Boris Johnson stood up in Parliament and said Covid rules were followed in Number 10 at all times. 'Now 100 fines have been issued by the police over partygate. It shows the shocking scale of the law-breaking in Johnson's Downing Street and the extent of his lies.'",
    "f29d3a89fe4031768a6bb5f588df5252882094003ebc4059b1ae5b40": "The Northern Ireland protocol has returned, and yet again, it is threatening the relationship between the UK and the EU. Both sides are locking horns over how to resolve this crisis which could see the whole Brexit agreement torn up and trade war potentially erupting. Here's what you need to know. What is the Northern Ireland protocol? The protocol was proposed as the solution to the Brexit stalemate between the EU and the UK back in 2019. Just months into his time in Downing Street, Boris Johnson signed off on it. It seemed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, therefore avoiding a revival of any past tensions which have cropped between the two countries. But, it means Northern Ireland now, like the Republic of Ireland, has to follow the EU's trade rules so there's no border checks when goods travel around the island of Ireland. As Northern Ireland technically left the EU along with the rest of the UK but still follows EU's single market rules, border checks had to be introduced in the Irish Sea instead. Anything travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland has to be checked as though coming from a third country. Why is everyone talking about it again now? Unionists have repeatedly said that the protocol separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and disrupts trade ever since it was introduced. Their arguments have come to a head after the Northern Ireland Assembly elections, which saw the main unionist party lose their majority for the first time since the Assembly was established. The DUP (Democratic Unionist Party) is currently refusing to nominate someone to be the deputy first minister. The Northern Ireland executive cannot operate without this role. The DUP claim, until the protocol is addressed, it will not only paralyse the executive but the whole assembly. The party could do this by refusing to back the nomination of an assembly speaker on Friday, which would have enabled the legislative body could operate without an executive. What has the UK said? Foreign secretary Liz Truss said on Tuesday night that the government was going to reject the EU's recent suggestions about how to fix the problem. She said: 'The current EU proposals fail to properly address the real issues affecting Northern Ireland and in some cases would take us backward.' The senior minister suggested that the bloc's reforms would see various chilled meats from Britain needing a vet certificate to enter Northern Ireland, and foods outside of the EU no longer available in the country. She explained: 'Our preference has always been for a negotiated solution but will not shy away from taking action to stabilise the situation in Northern Ireland if solutions cannot be found.' What has the UK proposed? The UK could set up new legislation to unilaterally scrap parts of the Brexit agreement signed in 2020, although Brussels says this would be a breach of the UK's obligations. According to The Times, this could mean scrapping checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland, simultaneously ending the EU's Court of Justice role in the country and allow businesses to stop following the bloc's trade regulations. A Whitehall source told POLITICO's Playbook: 'What is most disappointing here is Brussels truly holds some remarkable brilliant thinkers and yet the negotiations over the past year have shown the EU still clearly misunderstands what is practically happening in Northern Ireland and the structural issues with the protocol.' How has the EU responded? The EU is refusing to back down or renegotiate the protocol. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said: 'The protocol, as a cornerstone of the withdrawal agreement, is an international agreement. Its renegotiation is not an option. The European Union is united in this position.' This was echoed by the German chancellor Olaf Scholz who said: 'No one should unilaterally cancel, break or in any way attack the settlement we have agreed together.'  Ireland's Taoiseach Micheal Martin has also admitted that the protocol issues were 'very serious'. However, Belgian prime minister Alexander De Cross would be happy to cancel the entire Brexit deal, claiming he could not see any 'other solution'. So...What happens next? Truss is set to meet Sefcovic on Thursday in a bid to resolve the tensions. The foreign secretary is also looking to announce the radical bill (which would unilaterally scrap parts of the protocol) next Tuesday, even if the EU has not acted by then. Levelling up secretary Michael Gove warned on Wednesday that 'no option is off the table' when it comes to fixing the problems. Meanwhile, the EU is unlikely to renegotiate the protocol to secure the changes the UK is looking for.",
    "1ef8a067bcbd39ec94edd557dc8ef7e8a36da1d9217076fcbfe883e6": "'Check your poo.' These were the characteristically frank words that Deborah James chose to sign off with on the latest episode of You, Me and The Big C, the BBC podcast she has co-hosted for the past four years. In the episode, heartbreakingly titled Deborah James' Last Dance, the presenter and campaigner talked from her parents' garden to friend and producer Mike Holt about her devastating decision to end 'active treatment' for the bowel cancer she has fought since 2016. She has now switched to palliative hospice care at home with her family because, in her own words, 'my body simply isn't playing ball'. James, who goes by the name Bowelbabe on social media, also spoke movingly about her co-hosts, Lauren Mahon, now in remission, Rachael Bland, who died of cancer in September 2018, and Rachael's widow, Steve. 'Rach is always in my mind even now,' said James. 'I just don't know how brave she must have been to do what she did because I don't feel that brave. 'I think I am still in awe of how she seemed to take it in her stride, Quite frankly, I'm a quivering mess half the time. But I think if she can do it, I can do it. I'll go and party with her.' On Tuesday, James launched a Bowelbabe fund that has already raised a staggering PS3m for charity as members of the public follow her request to 'buy her a drink' by donating money to future cancer research. But in the final moments of the podcast, she had just two asks to make 'We'll see each other again, somewhere, somehow, dancing, and until then, please, please enjoy life because it is so precious. l can't tell you. All I want right now is more time and more life,' she said, her voice breaking as she spoke. 'Oh and also, check your poo. I can't leave on any other word apart from check your poo. I still have images of me dancing in poo outfits everywhere. So maybe I should leave on that final word. Check your poo.' Bleeding or blood can be a 'red flag' symptom of bowel cancer, but only a third of people are aware of this, according to the charity Bowel Cancer UK. What are the main symptoms of bowel cancer?  Deborah James is not alone in using her platform to raise awareness of bowel cancer. Newsreader George Alagiah recently discussed how his diagnosis has changed his whole outlook on life, while Radio 1 DJ Adele Roberts has been open about her time out in October 2021 for surgery to remove a tumour. However, recent research by Bowel Cancer UK for Bowel Cancer Awareness Month in April suggested awareness levels aren't where they should be. More than four in 10 people cannot name a single bowel cancer symptom, according to a survey by the charity - with awareness lowest among men. Half of UK men (55%) were unable to spot the signs, compared to 36% of women.  Here is a list of the most common symptoms of bowel cancer, experienced by many who go on to be diagnosed with the disease.    Bleeding from your bottom and/or blood in your poo   A persistent and unexplained change in bowel habit    Unexplained weight loss   Extreme tiredness for no obvious reason   A pain or lump in your tummy    As Bowel Cancer UK stresses, these symptoms don't mean you definitely have cancer, as each of these symptoms can be caused by other health problems. But if you are experiencing one or more or, as the charity says, 'things just don't feel right', you should speak to your GP. If you think you have a blocked bowel, you should also see a doctor straight away or go to your nearest A&E. Don't be embarrassed by bowel issues If you have any of the symptoms listed above, contact your GP 'as early as possible', advises Dr Philippa Kaye, author and a bowel cancer patient herself. 'As both a GP and someone who has had bowel cancer, I completely understand it can be daunting visiting your GP with symptoms. However it is so important that you book an appointment as early as possible - please don't feel embarrassed, don't ignore any symptoms and don't put it off,' says Dr Kaye. 'As GPs we are used to seeing lots of people with bowel problems and if you are worried that something is wrong we want to see you. Early diagnosis could save your life.' In a statement to HuffPost UK, Genevieve Edwards, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, echoes this advice, praising James for her closing podcast message, which she called a 'crucial' reminder. 'Deborah has always worked tirelessly to raise awareness of bowel cancer, and her determination to continue helping others is shining a huge spotlight on bowel cancer and its symptoms,' Edwards tells HuffPost UK. 'There is no doubt that lives have been saved, and will be saved now and in the future, thanks to the increase in awareness of the disease and its symptoms that Deborah has generated.' She adds: 'Bowel cancer is treatable and curable, especially if diagnosed early.'  So, let's all take a long hard look in the loo - it's what Bowelbabe wants us to do.",

Lucy Shtein and Maria 'Masha' Alyokhina, who are a couple, tricked officers surrounding Shtein's Moscow apartment by donning food delivery worker disguises. They managed to escape the country amid a heightened crackdown on anti-Putin sentiment as the Russian president's invasion of Ukraine falters on. 'It was really convenient that delivery couriers have such big bags. I even managed to put my beloved Mr. Rat in the bag,' Shtein, who left Russia in March, told The Guardian newspaper. Mr. Rat is her pet rat.  'We have become so used to delivery couriers roaming Moscow, so it was a foolproof way to escape,' she added. Alyokjina had initially planned to stay in Russia but followed her girlfriend out of the country last week. They have since reunited in Lithuania. Alyokjina detailed her dangerous escape to CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday, recalling staying at safe houses and her multiple attempts at crossing the Belarus-Lithuania border.

The singer shared a loved up picture showing her and the US sports agent each holding a set of keys outside their new home.  Adele revealed the relationship update in a series of snaps she posted to Instagram on Wednesday that charted her romance with Rich.  'Time flies,' she wrote.  The couple were first publicly linked last year, and were rumoured to be engaged after sporting a ring on her engagement ring at this year's Brit Awards - something she didn't deny during a later interview on The Graham Norton Show. She previously how they first met, saying during her interview with Oprah Winfrey on her US TV special One Night Only: 'I met him at a birthday party, we were on the dance floor. And then we met a couple years later. 'We went out for dinner, which he says was a business meeting and I'm like 'A business meeting about what?' And then it was the first time we hung out on our own.  'Without friends and I think that was a natural way that people would meet each other in real life.' Earlier this month, Adele - who officially finalised her divorce from ex-husband Simon Konecki in March 2021 - said she's 'never been happier' as she shared a thankful message with fans on her 34th birthday. The singer said she had 'so many blessings to be grateful for' as she reflected on the previous 12 months, which also saw her release her long-awaited fourth studio album 30. 'What a difference a year makes!' Adele wrote on Instagram. 'If time keeps healing and smoothing out all the creases in my life like it does as the years fly by, then I can't wait to be 60! 'I've never been happier! So many lessons, so many blessings to be grateful for. 'This is 34, and I love it here! Thank you for the birthday love as always x.' This year will see Adele performing for fans again - five years after she was forced to cancel dates at Wembley Stadium on doctor's orders. She will play two nights at Hyde Park's British Summer Time festival in July, while she is also expected to announce her rescheduled Las Vegas residency. Adele pulled the plug on the US dates at the last minute in January due to the show not being ready. In a Graham Norton interview the following month, she said she is 'working her arse off' to reschedule the dates, and that it will '100% happen this year'.",

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the city to open and attend a memorial, called the Glade of Light, in honour of the victims of the 2017 terrorist attack at Manchester Arena. Twenty-two people were killed by a suicide bomber at an Ariana Grande concert on May 22, 2017, and more than 50 people were seriously injured. An estimated 800 further victims suffered physical and psychological wounds. William spoke about visiting the city just after the attack, saying he remembered 'only too well the shock and grief on the faces of those I met.' 'Five years on, I know that the pain and the trauma felt by many has not gone away,' the duke said. 'As someone who lives with his own grief, I also know that what often matters most to the bereaved is that those we have lost are not forgotten,' he went on, in an apparent reference to his mother, Princess Diana, who died in 1997, when William was 15. 'There is comfort in remembering. In acknowledging that, while taken horribly soon, they lived. They changed our lives. They were loved and they are loved.' 'It is why memorials such as the Glade of Light are so important,' William said. 'Why Catherine and I so wanted to be amongst you today.'  The duke has mentioned his own grief in public remarks before, alluding to his mother's death in a powerful speech against extremism after a terror attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. William and his brother, Prince Harry, unveiled a memorial to their late mother last year, on what would have been her 60th birthday. The statue, created by sculptor Ian Rank-Broadley, occupies a permanent space in Kensington Palace's Sunken Garden. 'Today, on what would have been our Mother's 60 birthday, we remember her love, strength and character -- qualities that made her a force for good around the world, changing countless lives for the better,' the brothers said in a statement at the time. 'Every day, we wish she were still with us,' they continued. 'Our hope is that this statue will be seen forever as a symbol of her life and her legacy.'",

Conservative Lee Anderson told the Commons there was 'not this massive use for food banks'.  'You've got generation after generation who cannot cook properly. They can't cook a meal from scratch. They cannot budget,' he said. Speaking to Sky News on Thursday morning, prisons minister Victoria Atkins said that was 'absolutely not right'. 'This is not the view of me or anyone else in government. We want to give not just immediate help but longer-term support as well,' she said. 'I've spent my ministerial career working with very vulnerable people ... cooking lessons will not be the complete solution to that.' Anderson has defended his comments, arguing they have been misinterpreted.  'I did not say poor people cannot cook or there is no need for food banks. I said there is not the need currently being parrotted out by the MSM [mainstream media],' he wrote on Facebook. 'Today I challenged the whole Parliamentary Labour Party to come to Ashfield to visit the food bank I work with. The give food parcels away on the condition the enrole for cooking and budgeting lessons.' Labour branded Anderson's remarks 'beyond belief', the Lib Dems described them as 'disgraceful' and the SNP said they were 'crass'. The Child Poverty Action Group claimed politicians 'would do better to back real-world solutions, like bringing benefits in line with inflation this autumn'. While the Trussell Trust charity insisted 'cooking meals from scratch won't help families keep the lights on or put food on the table, if they don't have enough money in their pockets'. ",
    "1a090d2453a60841e0967dffaf3b59c599dfb594574855df54b5fb81": "Boris Johnson stumbled when asked how high the energy price cap is as millions struggle with their household bills. The prime minister failed to answer the question when asked by LBC's Nick Ferrari whether he was 'out of touch'. Johnson - who has two young children with his wife Carrie - also refused to answer when asked how much a pack of nappies cost from Boots. The PM is under increasing pressure to offer more help to those struggling with the cost of living after the Queen's Speech was criticised for offering no new support. Speaking to Johnson on a flight back from Helsinki, Finland, Ferrari asked: 'You stand accused of running an administration that's out of touch with the common man or woman. 'You have a supremely rich chancellor of the exchequer with a non-dom wife who doesn't know how to put petrol in his own car. 'Can you tell me you are in touch with people?' Ferrari asked the PM how much he thought 24 Pampers nappies cost at Boots. Johnson replied: 'I'm not going to get into...what I can tell you is that we will do everything we can to help people through a difficult time.' After refusing to answer whether he economised in the current climate, Ferrari then moved on to the energy price cap. 'What's the value of the price cap currently?' he asked. 'I'm not going to get into that.' 'Do you not know that prime minister?' Ferrari continued. Johnson replied: 'What we will do is make sure that we help people afford their weekly outgoings and the best way to deal with the energy price cap...is to make sure that we are not only helping people in the short term, it's helping people immediately.' Ferrari interrupted: 'It's PS1,971, just to help you out.' The prime minister set hares running when he said during the Queen's Speech debate on Tuesday that the chancellor would say more on the matter 'in the days to come'. However, the Treasury appeared blindsided by the move, with one Sunak ally telling HuffPost UK there were 'no announcements as far as we are aware'. Meanwhile, Lee Anderson, the Tory MP for Ashfield, has been criticised after he claimed people used food banks because they cannot 'cook a meal from scratch' or budget. His comments were immediately criticised as out of touch by Labour and MPs from other parties. Tory minister Victoria Atkins also condemned the comments this morning, saying Anderson's view was 'not the view of me or anyone else in government'. Energy bills have spiralled since the sector's regulator, Ofgem, raised the price cap in April. The government is under pressure to bring in measures that would provide immediate relief to struggling families, including a windfall tax on the profits on energy giants. In his LBC interview, Johnson repeatedly refused to rule out bringing in a windfall tax but he also said: 'I don't like them. I didn't think they're the right thing. 'I don't think they're the right way forward. I want those companies to make big, big investments.'",
    "8307ad3f32036c34ae6ae3972f2b6decad782f5bc2bcc631c9571662": "Both Sweden and Finland are considering the prospect of Nato membership in the face of Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine and its ongoing military aggression. Joining the US-led military alliance would mark a radical break in the policy of both north east European countries, underlining once again how Vladamir Putin's aggression has reshaped the post-Cold War order.  On Wednesday, British prime minister Boris Johnson toured both countries and formalised bilateral security agreements during a whirlwind 24 hours. Johnson said his government would give the countries 'whatever is requested' as part of the new pact. Here are some of the issues that have led to the Nordic rethink about entering the 30-nation alliance.  What is Nato?   The military alliance goes by the acronym of Nato.   The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was formed in 1949 to prevent a resurgence of nationalism and militarism in Europe after two world wars, and to deter the Soviet Union's expansion.   Its membership has swelled to 30 member nations, and over the 1990s and 2000s its enlargement stretched further east to include the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.   They agree to mutual defence - military action - in response to an enemy attack. The principle goes: 'An attack against one ally is considered as an attack against all allies.' This is Article 5 of the Nato constitution.    Ukraine is not a member of Nato, which is the main reason why the Western support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy has fallen short of putting their troops on the ground. Ukraine's admission to Nato has been a stated goal going back to its constitution in 2002, but Ukraine's president has accepted his country can't join at present. Nato's enlargement has been Putin's biggest publicly-stated grievance with the West during the build-up up to war, claiming the eastward expansion and potentially sweeping up the largest other former Soviet republic breaks promises. Adding Sweden and Finland is likely to trigger Putin's ire too. Moscow has warned it could deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad - sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania - if they do. Nato has been adamant it will not accept limits on the nations that it admits and has always maintained an 'open door policy'. What is Finland and Sweden's position?    Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed Finland and Sweden to the verge of applying for Nato membership, a move that would end staunch military neutrality for the two European nations. Finland, which shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia, and neighbouring Sweden will announce their decisions in the coming days. Any applications will usher in a tense wait during the months it takes to be ratified by all Nato members, though the alliance and the White House have said they were confident any security concerns could be addressed in the interim. Both countries have been non-aligned militarily since the Second World War, but have been edging towards their current position in response to an increasingly belligerent Russia.  Finland and Sweden switched from formal neutrality to military non-alignment in 1995 when they joined the European Union, and both have drawn closer to Nato in recent years, exchanging intelligence and participating in alliance exercises.  What is 'Finlandisation'? Finland gained independence from Russia in 1917 and fought two wars against it during the Second World War, where it lost some territory to Moscow. Finland signed an Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with Russia in 1948, cementing a degree of economic and political dependency and isolating it militarily from western Europe. The strict policy of neutrality is referred to as 'Finlandisation'.  The end of the Cold War, bringing a break-up of the Soviet Union, allowed Finland to step out of Russia's shadow as the threat from Moscow diminished. It has relied on its own military deterrence and friendly relations with Moscow to keep the peace. But with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, perceptions of relations with Russia as 'friendly' have been undermined. Opinion polls show support for membership in Finland is high, with people mindful of the long land border it shares with Russia. Support in parliament for an application is also broad. Sweden's post-Cold War cuts Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years and post-war foreign policy has focused on supporting democracy internationally, multilateral dialogue and nuclear disarmament. It ran down its military after the Cold War, cutting defence spending of up to four percent of its GDP to about one percent during the 1990s and early 2000s  Despite Putin's offensive, many on the left in Sweden remain suspicious of the US security agenda and Nato, which ultimately relies on the deterrence provided by America's nuclear arsenal. Polls show a substantial majority of Swedes back joining Nato, with support running just above 60% in the latest poll, and there is a majority in parliament in support of an application. When could they join? Finland has a Nato 'option', a kind of a plan of action that mandates applying if the security situation deteriorates, while Sweden's parliament will present a new security policy review on Friday, though the latter is not expected to contain an explicit recommendation concerning Nato. Sweden's ruling Social Democrats have called a parliamentary debate over Nato for Monday. Should the party as expected back joining, the government could call a vote about sending through an application, but it is not formally required to.",

After Selena posted a look at her skin care routine on TikTok earlier this week, some fans accused her of subtly mocking a video that Hailey had posted just hours earlier. Hailey, who married Selena's ex Justin Bieber in 2018, shared a 'get ready with me' video to TikTok showing fans her beauty routine. Later, Selena posted a video of her own, showcasing her skin care routine to Fleetwood Mac's Dreams. Selena - whose 2019 song Lose You To Love Me was widely thought to be about Justin Bieber - took to her comments section to clear the air about the misunderstanding.  'This is why I believe in taking care of your mental health. Guys no idea what I did but I really am sorry. Zero bad intention. Deleting soon,' Selena commented on her video, as seen in a screenshot from a fan. Still, some fans continued to speculate about possible tension between Selena and Hailey, given the timing of Selena's video. 'LOL I know who she's referring to,' one commenter wrote on Selena's TikTok video. 'Wait ... is she tryna make fun of you know who,' another commenter wrote. The Wizards of Waverly Place leading lady later turned off comments on the video. Selena said goodbye to her on-and-off relationship with Justin months before he wedded Hailey. The couple have been married since 2018. Over the years, fans have theorised that Selena and Hailey Bieber hold resentment toward each other, but the two women have always denied the rumours. Last month, Hailey addressed the issue in a TikTok, pleading with trolls to finally let the drama end.  'Leave me alone at this point,' she said. 'I'm minding my business. I don't do anything, I don't say anything. Leave me alone, please. Enough time has gone by where it's valid to leave me alone. I beg of you, truly. That's my only request.' 'Be miserable somewhere else, please,' she added.",

The Gossip Girl star participated in Vogue's Life in Looks video series Monday, in which stars take a walk down fashion-memory lane by reminiscing about some of the most stylish looks they've worn throughout their careers. During the video, Blake got especially excited while discussing the Versace gown and Lorraine Schwartz crown she wore to the 2018 Met Gala, and describes it to the magazine as 'without a doubt my favourite look of all time.'  But she was also quick to point out that her three young daughters -- James, 7, Inez, 5, and Betty, 2 -- that she shares with Ryan Reynolds don't exactly share the same opinion. 'It's something that when my kids are giving me attitude, I'm like, 'This is your mom,' I mean, come on!' Blake said, gesturing to a photo of herself in the stunning dress. 'I try to tell them that I'm real-life royalty and that they're lucky that I'm raising them.' Blake then began laughing, and self-deprecatingly added, 'They don't buy it. They don't believe it.' Maybe her kids need a stronger visual representation of how their mum tends to wear jaw-dropping pieces. May we suggest she show her kids the transformative gown she wore to the 2022 Met Gala -- ya know, the one that made her husband react like this?",

    "1bd7031518ea976ffabd22b58b8c49846023d3a9a23dc237c086ef77": "Keir Starmer's office has been accused of blocking a pro-Jeremy Corbyn councillor from becoming Labour's candidate in the Wakefield by-election, reigniting divisions in the party. Wakefield deputy council leader Jack Hemingway was one of a number of candidates vying to become the city's next MP following the conviction of Tory Imran Ahmad Khan for child sexual abuse. The by-election is seen as a must-win for Labour, given the circumstances surrounding the contest and the opportunity it provides for the party to claim it is winning back its former heartlands. But in a surprise move, Hemingway has been left off the longlist of candidates being considered. HuffPost UK understands the Leader of the Opposition's Office (Loto) was concerned about some of Hemingway's social media posts. A Labour source said: 'We don't block candidates for no good reason -- they must be thinking of the last leadership.' In one deleted post from July 2018, Hemingway said adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism would be a 'disastrous move'. In another post, Hemingway called for Corbyn to be reinstated as a party member after he was suspended over his response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report into anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. The EHRC found evidence of unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination while Corbyn was leader.  In response to the report, Corbyn said allegations about anti-Jewish racism on his watch had been 'dramatically overstated' by his political opponents. Corbyn was reinstated as a Labour member in November 2020 but he still does not have the party whip, meaning he sits as an independent MP. Hemingway told HuffPost UK: 'I'm a committed anti-racist and I think anti-Semitism is a scourge that should be eradicated. 'I've never hid the fact that I supported Jeremy Corbyn for leader and I voted for Rebecca Long-Bailey to be deputy...but I have always respected Keir's right to lead the party.' Hemingway also pointed out that as soon as the EHRC report was published he called for the party to adopt the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism in full. HuffPost UK understands that Loto wants either Kate Dearden, who works for the Community union, or Simon Lightwood, a former staffer for ex-Wakefield MP Mary Creagh, to be the party's by-election candidate. Both are known to have supported Remain in the EU referendum, which some local sources say may be a disadvantage in a seat that voted to leave the EU by 66.3 per cent. When Dearden confirmed via Twitter that she was standing in the by-election, her post was retweeted by Deborah Mattinson, Starmer's director of strategy. The retweet was later undone. Other candidates who have confirmed they want to stand for Labour in Wakefield include Sam Howarth, who used to work for Starmer's ex-political secretary Jenny Chapman, and who now works for Dan Jarvis MP. Wakefield councillor Michael Graham has also confirmed he is seeking the Labour nomination, as is law student Jakob Williamson. One Labour insider told HuffPost UK: 'Loto have seen Jack's tweets and they are not happy. 'They are going to put it down to two names: Kate and Simon. And they are going to keep Jack off.' A local source said: 'The most important thing is that we have a candidate that can withstand a by-election. 'You've got to have a candidate that is fireproof. 'Keir Starmer simply cannot afford to lose this -- end of. He's got to win, and he's got to be very, very careful that he gets the right candidate. 'Keir is trying to put out a particular image and he cannot afford to take any risks.' A Labour source with knowledge of the region said there was a perception within the local constituency Labour party (CLP) that the candidate shortlist would be a stitch-up. 'The CLP are convinced that their local choices are going to be blocked,' they said. 'It's pretty clear that the leaders' office want Dearden, and a screen grab of Deborah Mattinson retweeting her launch has spread like wild fire as proof of that. 'Locally there's a feeling that the higher ups have made their mind up of who is acceptable and who isn't. 'Everyone is really worried that it'll be a shortlist of non local people foisted on us so we have to choose the lesser of the evils not who we really want.  'Kate is not from Wakefield and doesn't know the membership. There's going to be a big push back against anyone seen as being parachuted in. 'It's not the sort of place that will take kindly to it.' A local party member added: 'The CLP have made it clear they want someone who has a genuine connection to the area and not someone who has been flown in.' The NEC drew up its longlist on Wednesday, with shortlisting and interviews taking place on Thursday. Hustings will be held on Sunday May 15, when local members will choose the candidate. A Labour Party spokesperson said: 'Working people in Wakefield have been badly let down by Boris Johnson's Conservatives, who ignored serious allegations of child sexual assault against their paedophile former MP Imran Ahmad Khan before his election. 'Wakefield deserves better and our selection process is now underway. 'Party members in the constituency will consider a shortlist in the coming days and be able to choose the Labour candidate to be Wakefield's new MP.' Labour lost Wakefield to the Tories by 3,358 votes at the 2019 general election after holding the seat since 1932. Imrad Ahmad Khan tendered his resignation on May 3, three weeks after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. A date for the by-election has yet to be announced. ",

You can submit a question here.  When you're first dating someone everything feels so exciting. From speaking to them every day, going on dates and feeling butterflies when you see them, it feels like you're on cloud 9. But sometimes in this honeymoon phase we can get so caught up with the romance, it can blind us from our actual feelings. Do we actually like our new found lover or do we just like the attention they give us? This week's reader Carol writes in asking: 'How do I know if I like someone or like the attention they're giving me? I've started dating someone and we have fun together, but I'm not sure if I like him or like the attention.' How do we know when we like someone?  Counselling Directory Claire Elmes says 'when we like someone everything feels more exciting and positive'.  'You may start to notice your thoughts and feelings change to be centred around them such as starting to like the same things, or missing them when they aren't around,' she says.  'Our bodies have physiological changes when we like someone and we release dopamine and norepinephrine which can make us feel excited and energetic and almost euphoric. Oxytocin levels also increase which boost attachment and safety feelings and can also make us feel a bit uneasy if relationships have been difficult in the past.' How do we know when we only like the attention someone is giving us?  Elmes advises watching out for these signs:    You may not be interested with them as a person, and find it difficult to get to know them on a deeper level.    You may get lonely easily when they're not around.   It can be hard to know whether we like a person or if we just like the attention they are giving us, especially as all of us like to feel special and so if we get positive attention from someone we are likely to respond with positive emotions.    Do you tell others about the other person? Sometimes if we just enjoy the attention that a person gives us we won't find them exciting to speak about and therefore don't tell our friends and family about them.    How can we tell someone that we don't have feelings for them without hurting them? 'Communicate with the other person in a warm and kind way, express that you currently don't have feelings for the individual in a clear but warm way,' says Elmes. 'Don't ignore them - it's important to confront the issue and give an explanation that you do not have feelings for someone rather than ignore them. Being ignored can be hurtful for the individual, and is often the least effective way to let someone know you don't have feelings for them.' If you are confident in your decision and your feelings, Elmes says it's important not to give the person false hope by putting the decision off (while you soak up that attention).  If you only like hanging out with someone for the attention - but can't see a future with them - it's not fair on the other person.  'This may lead to them having hopes for the future, and eventually getting let down and hurt when this doesn't happen,' says Elmes.  'It is also useful to remember that feelings grow over time so if you are not sure it might be useful to explore this with the person. Sometimes love grows and depending on the past relationships of both parties it might be that you get to know each other first.'  Love Stuck is for those who've hit a romantic wall, whether you're single or have been coupled up for decades.

    "9e6b401a82f4526be0a4ecea5b3ea51f80cd2f59122de4c3b000b7b1": "Since finishing in second place at Eurovision in 2019, it's safe to say that Italian singer Mahmood's star has only continued to rise. Not only has his track Soldi swiftly become a modern-day classic of the competition, held up by the BBC and Eurovision icon Mans Zelmermow as one of the best entries of all time, Mahmood also achieved huge highs in his career. He has broken streaming records in his home country of Italy, and just last week performed a sold out show at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire where he was given a welcome usually reserved for the likes of Harry Styles or Shawn Mendes. This year, he's returning to the competition alongside fellow Italian singer Blanco with their theatrical ballad Brividi. Since the pair's duet won the Italian selection show (the Sanremo Music Festival) in February, the track has reached number one in multiple countries, racked up 50 million views on YouTube and even landed among the top five most listened-to songs on Spotify worldwide. Not bad, considering Mahmood wasn't even sure whether to enter the song at Sanremo at all. 'It took me seven days to decide,' he admits to HuffPost UK, recalling Blanco's initial text message suggesting they take Brividi to the national competition. 'I'd already done Sanremo, and already won. So, I thought, 'is it better to be left with a good memory, or do we want to take a risk and try it again?'. Finally, I said that in life, if you don't take a risk, you are already dead. So I said, 'OK, let's go again to Sanremo'.' Now gearing up to return to the Eurovision stage, this time on his home soil, Mahmood's song with Blanco has been among the bookies' favourites for the win since its debut. Here's what he had to tell us ahead of this year's competition.... Were you always a fan of Eurovision, and how has your opinion of it changed over time? In reality, Italy hasn't always been a part of Eurovision. So, in Italy, the Sanremo Music Festival is much more visible, and Italian people are really attached to that. But Eurovision has become more famous in our country since around four or five years ago. And now Eurovision in Italy is really big. Do you have a favourite memory of being part of Eurovision? After the final in 2019, there were great parties. And I remember someone gave me a cocktail with my face on it - so that was really, really incredible, like a movie. No, that's the funny [answer]. The emotional [answer] is being in Tel Aviv for the first time, seeing a new country for the first time. I remember the people working for Eurovision were so professional, so precise. I'd never seen anything like that before in Italy. What are your all-time three favourite Eurovision songs? In 2011, Raphael Gualazzi went to Eurovision with Follia D'Amore. I loved that song, and he actually came in second place too! It was a little bit jazzy, and I love jazz. In Italy, it's not so popular, so when Rapahel Gualazzi represented with a pop-jazzy song, for me, he felt like a kind of innovator. And I remember in Tel Aviv, I was in a disco club, and everybody was dancing,. At one point they played Fuego by Eleni Foureira, and it was massive! People went crazy, and so I remember dancing like crazy to that. And maybe Waterloo by ABBA is another favourite, too. I really like that one. Why is Eurovision still so important? It's so important because it represents music from all over Europe. It's one of the biggest shows outside of America, you know? And also for people like French singers, Spanish singers or Italian singers, it's a huge platform to show a different type of music. For example, a lot of the songs this year are all in different styles. In Italy, music is so different to other countries, so it's important for Eurovision to show the different styles of other countries to all of Europe. Are you feeling any pressure ahead of competing at Eurovision, particularly as you did so well the first time around? No, we don't think about it. The only pressure that I have in this moment is that all the things that will go into the performance have to be perfect. Because it's not going to be a simple stage, you know? It's a huge stage. And to make sure it's a great performance, we have to check everything. We want to do the song justice. I'm zero competitive. I'm really competitive [when it comes to my own] music, you know, I want to do good music and do a great performance. But for me, competition [with others] in music is not a good thing. Because in a competition, where is art? Really, my biggest goal will be to do a great performance on stage. The rest is not important for me. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. We'll be publishing an interview with a new Eurovision legend every day leading up to this year's live final on Saturday 14 May. Come back tomorrow when we'll be speaking to this year's UK hopeful Sam Ryder. Watch the music video for Mahmood and Blanco's Brividi below:",

Host Fiona Bruce announced at the end of last week's programme that the outspoken German driver would be on the next panel in Hackney, London.  But there was a wave of excitement on social media when Question Time's Twitter feed paraded this week's guests ahead of Thursday's broadcast. Vettel has voiced his opinions on various political topics over the years, notably the environment and LGBT+ rights. Earlier this month he turned up at the Miami Grand Prix wearing a T-shirt suggesting it would be the first Formula 1 race to take place underwater thanks to climate change. When asked why he was appearing on QT, Vettel said it was a 'different format' and there will probably be 'different sorts of questions or topics to be spoken about'. It's unclear whether Vettel has actually seen the, at times, free-wheeling show that has given a platform to a philosophy graduate to 'vaxx-plain' to a vaccines expert, seen an audience member kicked off, and brought the 'passionate Highlander' to prominence. It was perhaps the prospect of a delicious encounter between a sporting great and the unpredictable British public that led to the online reaction. ",

Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Lee Anderson, the MP for Ashfield, invited other MPs to come to a food bank in his constituency. 'When people come now for a food parcel they have to register for a budgeting course and a cooking course,' he said. 'What we do at a food bank is we show them how to cook cheap and nutritious meals on a budget. We can make a meal for about 30p a day. He added: 'There's not this massive use for food banks in this country.' 'You've got generation after generation who cannot cook properly. They can't cook a meal from scratch. They cannot budget.' But he was immediately criticised for the comments. The SNP's Joanna Cherry said MPs were 'perfectly well aware of the requirement' for food banks across the country. 'The requirement for them is not because people don't know how to cook,' she said. 'It's because we have poverty in this country at a scale which should shame his government.'

The prime minister said the government would give the country 'whatever is requested' as part of a new security agreement. The deal, which Johnson signed with Swedish PM Magdalena Andersson today, says: 'Should either country suffer a disaster or attack, the United Kingdom and Sweden will, upon request from the affected country assist each other in a variety of ways, which may include military means.' It comes in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and moves by Sweden and Finland to join NATO. Asked at a press conference whether the agreement include British troops being deployed to Sweden if the country is attacked by Russia, Johnson said: 'What matters primarily is what Sweden decides to request.' He added: 'In the event of a disaster or an attack on Sweden, the UK would come to the assistance of Sweden with whatever Sweden requested.' Earlier, the PM had said: 'This week, many of us have been paying tribute to the brave men and women who secured victory and peace in Europe 77 years ago. 'So, it's a sad irony that we've been forced to discuss how best to fortify our shared defences against the empty conceit of a 21st century tyrant.' At the same press conference, Johnson said he wanted to 'move on' from the partygate row which has engulfed his leadership. The row was reignited earlier this week when Keir Starmer said he would resign as Labour leader if fined by Durham police over claims he also broke lockdown laws, Asked whether he was acting 'dishonourably' compared to the Labour leader, the PM said: 'We're trying to move beyond all that and trying to focus on the issues that really matter, not least the war in Ukraine.'",

Bo Selecta ran between 2002 and 2009 and saw Leigh Francis - also the creator of the character Keith Lemon - impersonating celebrities using exaggerated latex masks and prosthetics. Looking back at the show, Lorraine said she found the impression of her used throughout the series 'really distasteful'. Speaking to the podcast Be Honest, Lorraine said: 'I didn't complain, but I should have.' Admitting that she deliberately swerved watching Bo Selecta, she also voiced her disapproval over Leigh Francis' impression of Craig David, who she said is like 'the son I never had'. 'I was actually very, very upset at the portrayal of Craig David, because I adore Craig,' she explained. 'He's the kindest, loveliest man, and that absolutely derailed his career, there's no question of it. 'Of course, he's a brilliant artist and he got over it but for a few years that did badly affect him and his career.' She continued: 'With me, I just found it really distasteful, really horrible and I should have complained at the time, and I certainly would complain now. 'I think any woman would. The portrayal of everybody was actually very cruel.' In 2020, amid a renewed focus on the Black Lives Matter movement following the murder of George Floyd, Leigh Francis issued a public apology for his portrayal of Black celebrities in Bo Selecta, which included Michael Jackson, Trisha Goddard and Mel B. Alongside an apology video, he wrote: 'Following recent events, I've done a lot of talking and learning and I would like to put this out there. 'I want to apologise to anyone that was offended by Bo Selecta. I'm on a constant journey of knowledge and just wanted to say I'm deeply sorry.' Trisha Goddard later said she had spoken privately to Leigh prior to his apology, telling him: '[Bo Selecta] emboldened a lot of casual racism towards myself and others you parodied with big lips and noses. 'It would be a very powerful gesture for you to recognise what part you played in perpetuating blackface.' The talk show host also said that the impressions, which saw Leigh donning rubber masks to impersonate celebrities, left her feeling 'hurt, distaste and disgust', and that her children were bullied due to the show.",
    "669abb399f76ea57dcbeacddde89d671a117530559cf4a7faf35fcb1": "A Tory council leader has faced intense online backlash after he was pictured smiling and laughing while ceremoniously opening a food bank. Jeremy Kite, the borough council leader for Dartford, was seen in Facebook photos attending the official opening of the borough's new food bank, cutting a ribbon amid a smiling crowd. As the cost of living crisis worsens, and millions admit to skipping meals just to pay the bills, the photos have been accused of being completely tone deaf. The backlash even crept over to LBC radio station, where presenter James O'Brien began to criticise the photo when Kite actually called in on Wednesday morning. He explained: 'I love my town, I love the people in it, I'm trying to do the right thing. 'We were invited yesterday to open - it's not actually a brand new food bank, it's a new location where there's been a lot of work put into it by the volunteers and others. There was actually a bit of a joke just before the ribbon was cut and photographs will tell a snapshot of the moment.' The joke was allegedly about the countdown. Kite also said the opening ceremony was 'thrown by the people who organise and volunteer' in the food bank, who also wanted to put the ribbon in place to honour the occasion. As O'Brien asked Kite 'what the hell' he was thinking, the council leader said as a guest it would have been a 'mistake' to turn down the organisers' photo offer. The pictures were then deleted from the Mayor of Dartford's Facebook page following the outcry, but reposted a few hours later with a caption explaining: 'There have been a number of comments this morning suggesting that the cutting of a ribbon was inappropriate in those circumstances. 'This aspect of the visit was arranged by the organisers and volunteers and took place at their request. The council representatives were pleased to meet so many volunteers, organisers and clients of the food bank and wish it well in its new home.' The comments were limited to the owner of the page, but there were 88 reactions or either the angry or sad face emojis. Here's a roundup of some of the most furious responses on Twitter:",

According to The Times, the government will next week remove the need for checks on all goods being sent from Britain for use in Northern Ireland. The protocol forms part of the Brexit agreement between the UK and the EU.  It means there are no checks on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Scrapping the border checks would put the UK in breach of the treaty and has raised the prospect of a trade war. Belgium's prime minister, Alexander De Croo has warned the EU would take retaliatory measures. 'Don't touch this,' the Daily Telegraph reported him having said. 'If that agreement would be revoked, then I would think the whole system will be revoked. I would not see any other solution.' Maros Sefcovic, the vice-president of the European Commission, said: 'renegotiation is not an option'. Boris Johnson's spokesperson said on Tuesday: 'It remains a very serious situation. 'I think our preference still remains obviously to reach a negotiated solution. But we have been doing this for 16 months. 'We reserve the right to take further actions if solutions can't be found urgently.' They added: 'We are at a position where the proposals put in front of us do not improve things, in fact they are a backwards step.' The protocol was agreed in order to prevent a so-called hard border on the island of Ireland, amid concerns that would lead to return to violence. Instead, goods are checked when they travel from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland. Johnson agreed to this deal in 2019. But since then the government has said the system is not working as the checks are disrupting trade within the UK. Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland are also unhappy that there is a border between the region and the rest of the UK. Sinn Fein, the nationalist party which supports the protocol, emerged from last week's Northern Ireland Assembly elections as the largest party. But the DUP, the largest unionist party, has refused to join the new executive until its problems with the protocol are addressed.",

The pledge was contained in the Tory manifesto in the run-up to the 2019 general election. It said: 'Since 2010 there has been a considerable increase in homebuilding. We have delivered a million homes in the last five years in England: last year, we delivered the highest number of homes for almost 30 years. 'But it still isn't enough. That is why we will continue our progress towards our target of 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s.' Appearing on Radio 4's Today programme this morning, the levelling up secretary was asked if the government would hit its target. He said: 'We'll do everything we can but it's no kind of success simply to hit a target if the homes that are built are shoddy, in the wrong place, don't have the infrastructure required and are not contributing to beautiful communities. 'Ultimately, when you're building a new dwelling, you're not simply trying to hit a statistical target. I'm certainly not.' Pressed on whether the government was still committed to its manifesto pledge, Gove said: 'We are not bound - I am not bound - by one criterion alone when it comes to development. Arithmetic is important, but so is beauty, so is belonging, so is democracy.' But Downing Street later said the government remained committed to its target. 'Our target to deliver 300,000-a-year is central to our levelling up mission,' the prime minister's spokesperson said. 'We're certainly making progress towards that target. We are at 244,000-a-year currently. 'Some of the measures in this bill are designed to remove some of the barriers that can gum up planning applications and cause more resistance amongst local communities.'",
    "903b14c64231e3377ff0d835ebc3fa18f5bcd48c5741efbeca67be67": "Raw food allergies are on the rise and pose a particular risk to vegans and vegetarians, one of Britain's leading experts has said. Pollen food syndrome (PFS) - also known as oral allergy syndrome - is a hypersensitivity reaction to certain fruits, vegetables and nuts when consumed in their raw form. Cases have increased significantly in the last few years as a result of global heating, worsening pollution and changes in pollen patterns, Dr Isabel Skypala, the only consultant allergy dietician in the NHS, told the Guardian.  Around 13 million Brits who are allergic to pollen - especially birch tree pollen -and suffer from hay fever are considered high risk. PFS is triggered by unstable pollen antibodies found in proteins in some raw fruits and vegetables, nuts and soya. However, it isn't an issue when these ingredients are cooked.  What is raw food allergy? If you are susceptible to allergies you can become sensitised to airborne pollens by breathing them in. This is most commonly seen with hay fever. But many plant-based foods - fruit, vegetables, nuts and cereals - have a protein structure that is very similar to the pollen in trees, grasses and weeds. PFS is hypersensitivity reaction to certain raw fruits, vegetables and nuts which usually causes mild symptoms. But it can also be caused by foods popular among people who tend to avoid animal products, such as soya milk, avocados, jackfruit, edamame beans and smoothies. Other foods that can trigger PFS include raw apples, pears, kiwi fruits, strawberries, plums, cherries, cherry tomatoes, celery and carrot, the Anaphylaxis Campaign said. As well as this, frozen fruit or vegetables and peeling potatoes or other root vegetables can lead to itching or swelling in the hands and eyes. What are the symptoms? Symptoms of PFS usually occur within five to 10 minutes of eating the allergic food. Most people who suffer from PFS will only experience mild symptoms, but more troubling symptoms an include:  Itching Nausea Vomiting Difficulty breathing as their throat swells up  'While a lot of people with PFS are having a mild reaction, severe reactions are more frightening and more dangerous,' Dr Skypala said. 'A PFS reaction, mild or severe, makes people extremely anxious, and they often cut out all fruit and nuts, because they are worried about having another reaction.' According to Allergy UK, you may experience severe reactions if you:   Consume large amount of allergen in a short space of time such as nuts, soya milk, freshly squeezed juice and smoothies     Have allergies to several plant based foods   Have uncontrolled or asthma   Who is most at risk? PFS affects about 2% of the adult population in the UK and is often linked to sensitivity to grass, tree or weed pollen. The people most at risk are those who suffer from hay fever. It's someone's inherent sensitivity to pollen, rather than the fact they follow a meat-free diet, that puts them at risk, Dr Skypala said. Why has there been a rise?  'The rising prevalence of PFS comes at a time when there is a worldwide change in dietary habits, with more people adopting a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle. A vegan/vegetarian diet may also include soy and jackfruit, both of which can provoke severe PFS reactions,' The Anaphylaxis Campaign said. The rise in cases is adding pressure to the NHS. But, specialist services are under-resourced so sufferers might have to wait months to be seen, Skypala said.  However, you should always seek advice from your healthcare professional if you are concerned you may have had an allergic reaction to a plant based food.  ",

The prime minister spoke out as he was quizzed about Keir Starmer's pledge to resign if he is fined over beergate. Johnson has already been handed a fixed penalty notice by the Metropolitan Police for attending his own birthday party in the Cabinet Room in Number 10 in June, 2020. He has repeatedly insisted he will not quit, despite the threat of more fines for other parties being investigated by the police. Asked at a press conference in Sweden whether he was acting 'dishonourably' compared to the Labour leader, the PM said: 'We're trying to move beyond all that and trying to focus on the issues that really matter, not least the war in Ukraine.' The partygate scandal resulted in several Tory MPs publicly calling on Johnson to resign, with even more submitting letters of no confidence in his leadership to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. Durham Constabulary last week announced that they were re-opening their investigation into whether Starmer breached covid guidelines by having curry and beer with colleagues in April last year. In response, the Labour leader said he will resign if the police issue him with a fine. He said: 'If the police decide to issue me with a fixed penalty notice I would of course do the right thing and step down.' The Labour leader said the idea he would 'casually break' Covid restrictions was 'wrong'.",

Executive producer Jason Herbison has spoken out about the singer returning as Charlene Robinson alongside Jason Donovan as on-screen husband Scott, as the Australian soap ends after 37 years this summer.  After much speculation, last month it was announced Kylie and Jason would appear in the finale more than three decades after leaving their roles, as a teaser of their scripts was posted on social media.  The soap boss revealed that the pair have already shot their scenes ahead of the show wrapping filming next month, which he described as a 'very moving experience'. Speaking to Inside Soap magazine, he said: 'Both Kylie and Jason needed very little persuading at all - they both appreciate the show and the special role that it has played in their careers. 'It's a lovely show of respect to Neighbours, and I was thrilled when they said yes. It didn't feel right to end the show without them.' Jason said their scene had been written in 'total secrecy', explaining: 'Not even the script department knew it was happening!' He added: 'I was there on the day of filming, and it was a very moving experience and one that will remain with me well beyond the series wrapping in August. I feel very privileged to have been part of it.' Neighbours will air its final episode in both the UK and Australia on 1 August, with a host of other characters from across its 37 years also returning for its send off.  They include actors Ian Smith (Harold Bishop), Peter O'Brien (Shane Ramsay), Mark Little (Joe Mangel), Daniel MacPherson (Joel Samuels) and Natalie Bassingthwaighte (Izzy Hoyland). Jason said in a statement: 'Whether the 80s, 90s, noughties or teens is your favourite decade, we will be delivering something for everyone as Neighbours draws to a close. 'Alongside the current cast we will be celebrating the most memorable characters from across many eras, with a few surprises up our sleeve.' Earlier this year, it was revealed the future of the show was in jeopardy after UK broadcaster Channel 5 announced it would stop airing Neighbours from this summer. After the search for a new UK broadcast partner proved unsuccessful, it was confirmed the show would come to an end altogether, with bosses promising to 'end the show on an incredible high'. Over the years, Neighbours also helped launch the careers of many other Australian stars, including Natalie Imbruglia, Liam Hemsworth and two-time Oscar nominee Margot Robbie.",

The Levelling Up secretary got everyone talking with his appearance on the show on Wednesday morning, attempting a number of bizarre impressions.  As Dan and co-host Sally Nugent quizzed Gove on whether there would be an emergency budget to ease the cost of living crisis, he appeared to impersonate a character from one of Harry Enfield's 90s sketch 'Scousers'.  The senior Conservative politician also appeared to attempt an American accent when he accused pundits of misinterpreting the prime minister's words into 'a major, capital letters, big news story!'

The Homes Under The Hammer presenter's organs started to fail after a sack around his heart filled with fluid, meaning it could not pump properly.  During Wednesday's This Morning, Martin discussed his recent health scare, and explained he had been feeling 'under the weather for a couple of weeks' before being taken to hospital, initially believing he might have been suffering with long Covid.  'I've had a few chest infections over the last few years and I've had asthma since childhood, so I'm used to quite a tight chest,' he told hosts Phillip Schofield and Rochelle Humes. 'As it approached the Easter Bank Holiday weekend, it was starting to get really bad where I could hardly walk without struggling for breath. 'It looked like it could have been the symptoms for long Covid - real lethargy, a tightness in the chest, pain in the chest, difficulty breathing, so you pause it and pause it and by the time it got to just after the Bank Holiday weekend, I was starting to be delirious, putting letters the wrong way round, I said to Kirsty [his wife], 'We've got to go to hospital.'' Martin continued: 'There's a sack around your heart and it was filling with fluid, it's called a pericardial effusion and that in turn is something called a tapenade, which basically means this sack is squeezing the heart it sits around, so the heart isn't able to expand, and therefore isn't able to pump, so it means all of your organs start failing. 'By the time they got to me, my kidneys were at 30 per cent, my liver was at 30 per cent, my lungs weren't getting the oxygen and at any point, I could have had a heart attack... The heart would have been strangled by itself.'  He added: 'We're talking minutes stroke hours of life left here.' Martin said he then had a 'dark red/black liquid' drained from his chest under a local anaesthetic.  His wife Kirsty described his health scare as a 'watershed moment' for them both to readjust their pace of life.  But Martin added he will start filming Homes Under the Hammer again in a few weeks. 'I've got to get to 20 years,' he said. 'Hopefully I'll get some nicer properties and they'll cherry pick the good ones, rather than the really bad ones.' This Morning airs weekdays at 10am on ITV.

    "ea7d95dd8a549825eb021d3096df92881946eb7f35b55f334c8915d7": "The government did not lay out any feasible plan to address the cost of living crisis in the Queen's Speech on Tuesday - even though, according to experts, it still has the means to do so. Prime minister Boris Johnson did suggest he would act on the crisis soon, telling the Commons he and Rishi Sunak will be 'saying more about this in the days to come'. However, levelling up secretary Michael Gove and Treasury officials have rejected the idea that this could mean an emergency budget is on its way. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility - the official independent forecaster - there is approximately PS20 billion left for the Treasury to help out with the general public's finances without causing too much trouble further down the line. But the Treasury has chosen not to use it. So here are nine ways the government could spend that money to alleviate the current crisis: 1. Uplifting Universal Credit by PS25 a week This would cost the government PS1.35 billion to do this for six months, between May and October, according to calculations from National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). Another think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), echoed this idea and proposed an increase in universal credit and legacy benefits of 8.1%, along with increasing child benefit by PS10 per week, per individual. This would cost PS1.5 billion more than Sunak's Spring Statement but would keep the crisis impact on the poorest people below PS200. Economist at King's College London and former Treasury official, Jeevun Sandher, also suggested that bringing back universal credit uplift would cost PS6 billion - which is less than 1% of GDP. He told The Big Issue: 'There is only one reliable way to help families who can't make ends meet. And that is with cold, hard cash.' 2. One-off cash payment of PS250 for energy bills This would go towards the 11.3 million households in the bottom half of the income distribution, and would cost PS2.85 billion, according to the NIESR. When Ofgem - the energy regulator - lifted the price cap at the beginning of April on energy bills, the cost of living crisis really kicked in. The annual energy bill for the average household rose by PS700 (54%) for England, Wales and Scotland. It means consumers will end up paying closer to PS1,971 on average for their yearly gas and electricity bills, potentially pushing almost six million people into fuel poverty. 3. One-off windfall tax on oil and gas Labour claim this would cut household bills up to PS600 and help support businesses through this trying time. A windfall tax targets the excess profits a company, or group of companies, did not expect to make. Here, it means oil and gas firms earning more as energy prices surge around the world due to the war in Ukraine would have to hand it over to the government. IPPR also backs this measure, while calling for more investment into renewable power and for the government to fully endorse onshore wind power. At the moment, the UK is vulnerable to the staggered progress on renewables, energy efficiency and energy storage. However, Johnson has already dismissed the idea of a windfall tax, claiming increasing taxes would 'stop investment' by oil and gas companies in the UK. 4. Emergency budget Labour and the Liberal Democrats have pushed for the government to roll out an emergency budget. Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: 'Millions of families and pensioners are struggling to get by. They need more help now before things get even worse in the autumn.' She added: 'An emergency budget is needed now to cut taxes for ordinary families while taxing the super profits of oil and gas companies.' According to The Independent, Derek Lickorish, former chair of the government's fuel poverty advisory group, also suggested that between eight and 10 million households need an extra PS1,000 each to 'get them through this very, very difficult period'. He estimated that this would cost between PS8 and PS10 million, explaining: 'Repayment of this sum is impossible for these consumers -- it has to be a grant. These are exceptional circumstances. It's going to have to go on the government's credit card.' 5. Scrapping the national insurance rise  The hike in national insurance contributions has significantly added to the stress of the cost of living when it kicked in on April 6. It meant workers had to pay more towards national insurance, as their tax climbed up from 1.25 percentage points from 12% to 13.25%. Labour's Jonathan Reynolds said: 'The Conservatives' decision to hike taxes during a cost of living crisis will make things even harder for businesses and families.' The majority of the rise will be covered by key sectors such as manufacturing, while employers in the health and social care sector will face an extra PS1billion in tax. Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'The small business tax burden is now at its greatest since the 1950s.' Labour suggests that one-off windfall tax on profits instead of the national insurance increase would help the smaller firms who are more vulnerable. 6. Tackling insulation costs IPPR has suggested the warm homes discount - one-off discount to your electricity bill for people on low incomes or those relying on pension credit - could be increased from PS140 to PS540. This would help the 8.5 million households who are currently on the scheme. In the long-term, the government could introduce PS18 billion investment for home insulation and low carbon heating to cut the country's energy bills. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas has suggested a street-by-street home insulation programme would be more efficient, while also addressing the pressing climate crisis. 7. Addressing food accessibility The yearly amount we spend on groceries is expected to rise by an average of PS271, according to data analytics company Kantar. To tackle this and prevent the rising levels of poverty, the government could cut tariffs on food which can't be produced in Britain and has to be imported, like rice. Local authorities have also called for the government to push a 'cash first approach' to food insecurity, a technique also recommended by the Independent Food Aid Network. Promoting a cash first approach would allow local authorities to provide direct, easy accessible cash payments to people struggling with the financial crisis, along with pushing for systemic changes which would increase social security payments and wages to mach the cost of living. Is the Treasury already helping? The government has announced a few measures to assist with the crisis, including a tax cut of more than PS330 a year for the typical employee. It has also lowered the Universal Credit taper rate to help people keep more of the money they earn and offered PS350 to millions of households to assist with the energy bills. There's tax-free childcare for about PS2,000 a year and pension credit, is worth around PS3,300 a year, but critics believe none of these measures go far enough when it comes to alleviate the looming financial crisis. Gove did hint that benefits could go up on Wednesday, saying Sunak and the work and pensions secretary Therese Coffey are 'looking hard' at what they can do, but the government is yet to make an announcement in this sector. What will happen if the government doesn't do more? Economic growth is expected to slow significantly, while 1.5 million households could end up struggling to pay food and energy bills in the next 12 months. The UK would be pushed into a recession - meaning two consecutive quarters where the economy shrinks - while inflation is already at a 30-year high. The Bank of England has even cautioned that inflation could rise 10% in the coming months and households would have even less disposable income. 'Without this targeted support, we expect a further increase in extreme poverty,' NIESR said, especially with the added squeeze from the Ukraine war. It added that 250,000 households face 'destitution' without immediate support. Tony Danker of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) also told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Downing Street needs to incentivise people to invest now. He suggested the government should cut business rates or subsidise the shift to clean energy, otherwise 'the economy will end up in more trouble'. Meanwhile, the Yorkshire Building Society has suggested households may face PS100 per month shortfall by 2024.",

The ads used words such as shiitake, pistachio and fettuccine in place of popular phrases.  One of them said 'what a load of shiitake' with an image of a mushroom, while another featured a nut next to the words 'they're taking the pistachio'. A third revealed pasta uncovering the words 'for fettuccine's sake'.  And naturally, 52 people complained. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) declared the images 'were likely to cause serious and widespread offence' and told Tesco to stop using the ads.  Tesco Mobile claimed it didn't actually use any offensive words or images, but agreed to the ban and apologised nevertheless.  But what do you make of it? A draconian response over a bit of fun? Or careless advertising? Whichever camp you are, you might be wondering when swearing became so taboo and how attitudes towards it changed. We spoke to Tony Thorne, a lexicographer and language consultant at King's College London, who tells us we've learned to associate swearing with personality and morals. 'Many Brits still affect to be shocked by bad language because they think it fits an image of respectability,' he tells HuffPost. 'In fact scientists have proved that swearing is therapeutic and most people do it, even if not publicly. 'Lots of brands have tried to use plays on rude words, since FCUK, but younger consumers often find these cringeworthy while older consumers may find them offensive - or obscure if they don't get the reference.' He points to Claudine Davi's Letters from the linguists: the evolution of swearing, which shows that profanity came from blasphemy - against God, against royalty.  Then in the 18th and 19th century, it evolved into a social taboo which elevated its status. Forbidden words had more power to shock and disgust, something that somewhat remains. But now, we have more commonly accepted obscenities that won't cause anyone to cast a second look. Unless they're on a Tesco advert, maybe.",

One definite exception to this would be SuRie, who competed with her song Storm in 2018, and has remained close to British fans' hearts ever since, appearing at a string of official Eurovision gigs and fan events alike in the past four years. 'I feel so lucky because [representing the UK] has been anything but a poisoned chalice for me,' she tells HuffPost UK as preparations for this year's contest get underway. 'It's been an absolute gift that keeps on giving. 'I don't know I can really answer why, but I'm incredibly grateful for it. We've gone on quite a path together, which is just a thrill. 'We can be a fickle bunch, can't we, as Brits? But I love us for our cynical, self-deprecating attitude as well.' Of course, SuRie does have one theory about her enduring popularity, which relates to why her 2018 performance was so infamous. 'I mean, I had quite a unique moment on the Eurovision stage, so maybe that's had something to do with how much people have taken me under their wing,' she suggests. For those in need of a reminder, SuRie was at the centre of a stage invasion during her performance in 2018, when a man burst onto the stage, stole her microphone and shouted a message 'demanding freedom' from the 'modern Nazis of the UK media'. The man in question was removed from the stage by security, and while a lesser performer might have crumbled in the heat of the moment, a defiant SuRie won praise for her tenacity and persistence, finishing the song with gusto and a visible fire in her. 'It was so surreal that it came back on the lyrics, 'hold your head up, don't give up',' she recalls. 'You can see in my eyes how fired up I was. I mean, I was livid. 'But the empowerment of the last part of the song, plus the incredible reaction from the crowd, that's what I take away from it.' 'I don't wish what happened to me on stage upon anyone,' she quickly adds. 'But that's not the moment I take away. It's the 30 seconds at the end where everyone got behind me and that roar was shared by all.' SuRie has always publicly shown a sense of humour about the incident ('life is tough enough'), but admits this isn't something she's always found easy. 'In the immediate aftermath, it wasn't particularly funny,' she recalls. 'I tried my best to keep my calm and composure on stage, but immediately after, when I was backstage, I wasn't laughing. 'I went through a phase of obsessively watching it. And I'm not saying that was a healthy thing, but that was just part of my brain trying to make sense of the fall-out of what happened on stage. And also I was watching it from different angles, from fans who'd filmed it in the stadium. Even though I very vividly remember what happened, I was there! I don't necessarily need to fill in the gaps! 'I'm fine now, and I was fine quite quickly afterwards. But yes, I do like to keep humour a big part of my life as well. It was my moment, I can't change it, can I? It's what happened. There we go.' Here's what else SuRie had to say when we spoke all things Eurovision with the Storm singer... What's your first memory of watching Eurovision? I was first introduced to Eurovision in 2015. I didn't watch it growing up, which is shameful to admit. So, my first real experience of Eurovision was actually working at it, as a backing singer and dancer for Loic Nottet, representing Belgium with Rhythm Inside. I had the most phenomenal time in Vienna, and I was invited back in 2017 to Kyiv with the Belgian delegation again, this time with Blanche and City Lights. Then I met with the BBC backstage and started working with them as a songwriter. And that led to my 2018 moment. Have you always been a fan of Eurovision, and has your opinion of it changed over time? I was just clueless about it at first. And again, I shamefully admit that because, I have since listened back to the wealth of songwriting gold that there has been over the 60-odd years, and not having those Eurovision parties or moments or nights with my family growing up, I'm sad and kicking myself that I missed out on that. Being there in person, my mind was blown to the beautiful, inclusive celebratory world that Eurovision is. And now I'm hooked. I'm a true convert. What's your favourite memory of being part of Eurovision? I had the most amazing memories twice over with the Belgian delegation, who just treated us so incredibly. But nothing can compare with actually flying the flag for the country that you are very proud of - for all our flaws and all our faults and everything. I suppose [the best memory] is just the rush of adrenaline and the visceral emotional reaction in the few seconds where you take to the stage. The camera light comes on, the little sound in your ear counts you down, nothing will ever compare with that memory. I describe it like white noise. Everything was so calm in that moment, like, 'I am completely in the right place doing exactly the right thing that I should be doing with my life'. And that was a really happy feeling. Who are you rooting for at Eurovision this year? I've listened to them all, and it's a wonderful bunch. There's something for everyone, which is what I love about Eurovision Cornelia's Hold Me Closer [for Sweden] is an absolute earworm of a tune. But for me, Maro for Portugal is my favourite. It just makes my heart sad and happy, with this melancholic yearning mixed with light folk music. It gives me a really really visceral reaction, and I can't argue with that. Compared to everything else, that is the one that gets into my chest, tugs on my heartstrings and reminds me that I'm alive. And there's no better reaction to music than that. I hope it does well. What are your three all-time favourite Eurovision songs? I loved Carl Espen's Silent Storm as a tune even before my Lisbon moment. But after that, the poignancy of those lyrics took on a whole new meaning. That's one of my favourites. Also, I love the quirky ones, like Nocturne by Secret Garden. That an instrumental, cinematic soundscape of a track can win at Eurovision is just amazing. And I know this might feel like a bit of a cop-out, but I have to say Duncan Laurence's Arcade. There can be a strength in stillness and simplicity, and songwriting rising to the top in this theatrical spectacle of a show. Arcade is a beautiful song. Why is Eurovision still so important? I implore anyone to go to one Eurovision Song Contest in their life and soak up the positive inclusive energy that is not just in the arena, or in the shows, but in the whole host city. If we could bottle up some of that positive energy that is unique and indescribable to those that don't know Eurovision, we could solve a lot of the world's problems. Eurovision for world peace, I think.  Would you ever consider going back to Eurovision to compete in the future? I feel lucky to have had a hat-trick of Eurovision memories in different capacities. But, of course I would go again. Nothing would bring me more pleasure, because it is the most incredible show. The difference this time is I would like to have more creative input and have more of a hand in things artistically. So, yes, I would love to go again. I may have tried, and I was maybe told no... But we'll see - things take time. And maybe it's for the best, maybe I need to go away, work on my craft and make sure I've got something really impossible to say no to.  This interview has been edited for clarity and length.   We'll be publishing an interview with a different Eurovision legend every day leading up to this year's live final on Saturday 14 May. Come back tomorrow when we'll be speaking to returning favourite Mahmood, who will represent Italy for the second time in 2022. ",

The former Grey's Anatomy star is currently appearing in a revival of Take Me Out, a baseball-themed play which centres around themes of sexuality, race and toxic masculinity. Take Me Out also includes scenes of full-frontal nudity, and while audience members are asked not to take photos during the show, one defied this rule and posted pictures of Jesse naked on social media this week. Speaking during the Watch What Happens Live after-show, Jesse downplayed the pictures, insisting: 'It's a body, once you see it, you realise it's whatever, it's a boy! I just have to make it not that big of a deal.' However, the Second Stage Theatre - the production company behind Take Me Out - had a rather different viewpoint on the leaked photos, which they called a 'gross and unacceptable violation'. 'It is deeply unfortunate that one audience member chose to disrespect the production, their fellow audience members, and most importantly, the case in this matter,' they said in a statement. 'Posting it on the internet is a gross and unacceptable violation of trust between the actor and audience forged in the theater community.' Last month, Jesse admitted he'd been 'terrified' at the prospect of going nude in front of an entire theatre audience, before he embraced being taken out of his comfort zone. 'I was terrified,' he told Page Six. 'But then I noted that that was what I asked God for. I asked to be terrified. 'I asked to do something that was scary and challenging and made me earn it and made me feel alive and not comfortable.'",

The former Coronation Street star and Celebrity Big Brother winner had been taking part in a synchronised dive on the ITV show, when his Speedos came down after he hit the water. When the actor was asked about the wardrobe malfunction after the event, he joked: 'Oh really? Did the sock fall out?' It didn't go unnoticed by delighted viewers at home... Ahead of competing in The Games, Ryan showed off his body transformation after 12 weeks of intense training. Sharing a photo of his toned physique, he wrote: 'The wait is finally over and what a journey it's been. 12 weeks of intense training learning nine different athletic sports with some of the best coaches in the country.' He continued: 'With a massive thank you to my PT @michaelevansfitness preparing me mentally and physically for this challenge we worked so hard being dedicated to the routine, diet and determination.' Ryan is competing with 11 other celebs in a series of Olympic-style sporting events to see who will eventually win the bronze, silver and gold medals at the end of the week.

Impersonating the famous 90's sketch featuring moustachioed, permed and shell-suited 'Scousers', the cabinet minister said: 'Calm down!' In the show, the actors would say 'eh alright, alright, calm down, calm down' to stop their bickering coming to blows. Gove made the unusual display when he was being quizzed on BBC Breakfast about whether there would be an emergency budget to ease the cost of living crisis. Referring to the Treasury's slap-down over speculation of an emergency budget, Gove told BBC Breakfast: 'In fact, when the Treasury quite rightly say 'calm down!' then people, instead of recognising they've overinflated the story in the first place, then say 'oh this is clearly a split'.'  The senior Conservative politician also appeared to attempt an American accent when he accused pundits of misinterpreting the prime minister's words. In an American accent he accused commentators of trying to turn Boris Johnson's comments into: 'A major, capital letters, big news story!' He also grew particularly animated when tackling the topic, waving his head in another accent saying: 'That doesn't amount to an emergency budget!' Social media users poked fun at the cabinet minister, including one who said: 'Quite a strange interview by Michael Gove this morning. Saying something that his comedy Scouser 'calm down' wasn't the worst bit.' Another added: 'Does anyone have a mechanical pencil or a pin handy, we need to reboot the Secretary of State for Levelling Up again.' Labour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner seized the moment to rinse Gove, saying: 'Is the cost of living crisis just a joke to them? This is not a serious government. We need an emergency budget right now.' Labour MP Karl Turner added: 'Embarrassing. There's a cost of living crisis and a government minister is doing silly voices during an interview.'",
    "e6ef02b5d5c5ab19d8db4ad061f5b9d2409424eaddcd2303d2cd21cd": "TW: this article contains reference to suicide, alcoholism and suicide attempts.  Will Young captured the nation's hearts with his smiley persona and sweet voice during the inaugural series of ITV's Pop Idol. But off stage, he spent 20 years trying to help his brother overcome alcoholism. His twin, Rupert, had struggled with mental illness for years, with suicide attempts that began from the age of 18. But his drinking began to spiral around 2002, just as Will's career took off. In July 2020, the singer received the devastating news that Rupert had taken his own life. In a new documentary, Will Young: Losing My Twin Rupert, the singer shares what it's like to be the family member of somebody who's alcohol dependent - and learns more about the condition that impacted all their lives. Here are seven things we learned.  Alcoholism and mental illness are intertwined  'I think the important thing to note is that the anxiety and depression that Rupert felt was there before the alcohol,' Will notes early in the programme. His family are unable to pinpoint where Rupert's unhappiness began, but Will notes that both brothers faced abusive behaviour by teachers at their boarding school, where smacking with slippers and hiding emotion was considered normal. On one occasion, Will says a teacher threw Rupert against the library bookshelf by his throat, but at the time they didn't feel able to complain or tell their parents.  You never know what's going on at home  The idea that 'you never know what's going on behind closed doors' is so often repeated, it can feel a little tired. But Will's account of going on stage during the first Pop Idol live show really brings it home. Rupert was watching in the wings and right before Will went on to sing, the stitches he had on his wrist from a recent suicide attempt burst open. Their mother recalls Rupert holding his bleeding wrist and refusing to go to the ambulance until he'd watched Will perform.  'I just thought: 'I just have to get on with it,'' Will says.  Access to treatment is dire  In England, it's estimated that there are around 1.6 million people who are alcohol dependent. And of those that need specialist treatment, just 18% are getting it.  Will admits: 'I've had over 20 years of dealing with my brother being an alcoholic and I still could not tell you what the policy is within the national health.' He meets Julia Sinclair, Professor of Addiction Psychiatry within Medicine at the University of Southampton, who tells him 'many things in the system are now broken'. For example, she knows of some areas with 18-month waiting lists and says some psychological services won't even take on the patient until they're in recovery.  'There are so few places now available,' she says. 'I think we have five inpatient units now in the country - that is it. ' The number of people impacted by alcoholism is actually closer to 8 million  Although an estimated 1.6 million people in England are alcohol dependent, we hear in the programme that for every one person struggling with this addition, five others are impacted. So, when you consider the impact on close friends and family, it's actually more accurate to say 8 million people in England are impacted by alcoholism. Planning after rehab is vitally important  During the show Will meets Melissa Rice, an author and podcast host who's been sober for four years. 'Alcohol for me was a solution, until the solution was then the problem,' she explains. 'I developed a dependency to it because I couldn't cope with how I felt about myself.' Rice takes Will back to the rehab centre where her recovery began and speaks about the difficulty of returning home after a six-week stay.  'Wherever you're going back to - say for instance you're going back to your family - they haven't gone through this process, they haven't had all of these lessons and they haven't had the therapy,' she says. 'So you can potentially be going back to somewhere that's quite vulnerable. Planning before you leave is really important.' There's huge health inequality surrounding alcoholism  Will talks openly about the amount of money he spent trying to 'save' his brother, revealing that at one point he was paying for regular rehab stays that were PS50,000 a time.  'I'm very aware that myself and my family, because of our earning capacity, were at least able to give Rupert the chance,' he says. 'But I worry about the people who can't even get that chance.' Of course, access to the best healthcare sometimes is not enough. During the show, Will visits a rehab centre and after meeting staff, regrets never trying that particular one for his brother.  'Rupert did go to good rehabs, so I think there's a sadness that it just didn't work,' he says.  Families face impossible decisions  Will's brother moved in with him in 2016 and the singer quickly became his carer, having to clean and feed him, and deal with sick and urine mess around the house on a daily basis. When this became too much to bear - and Will worried he was 'enabling' his brother's behaviour - he asked him to leave. In July 2020, two police officers arrived at his door to tell him Rupert had taken his own life.  During the show, he meets other family members who've made impossible decisions, including Natalie Needham, the founder of the 'Stitch Away the Stigma' art project, who called the police to get her drunk father removed from her grandmother's house, affectively making him homeless. 'I did that, and now I've got to live with that,' she says. 'But it was the right thing. It's taken me a long time to get there, but it was the right thing to do...'  Throughout the programme, Will comes back to the idea that he did everything he could for his brother, but it still doesn't feel like enough. 'It bought a whole load of grief,' he says, 'the fact that I couldn't save him.' Will Young: Losing My Twin Rupert is on Channel 4 at 10.05pm, then available on All4.

    "54bd0439923aaf48f8e13e1333f19eda65626d6630c0b96badafaa13": "Succession actor James Cromwell glued himself to a Starbucks counter in protest over the coffee firm charging extra for vegan milk. The 82-year-old Oscar nominee, who is also known for his roles in Babe: Pig in the City and LA Confidential, joined the protest organised by the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in New York City. He sat on a counter wearing a 'Free the Animals' T-shirt and read a statement denouncing the surcharge for plant-based milk. 'More than 13,000 customers have asked you, now we're asking you,' he said. 'Will you stop charging more for vegan milk? When will you stop penalising people for their ethnicities, their morals?' James went on to say the 'senseless' charge affects mother cows - which are forced to reproduce to keep up with the demand for milk and then are separated from their calves. 'These mothers must endure the loss of their child over and over again,' he said. 'They suffer no less than human mothers would.' James - who plays Uncle Ewan, the anti-capitalist brother of a billionaire media mogul in Succession - later used a knife to scrape his glued hand off the counter. Police said no arrests were made over the incident. Starbucks branches in the United States charge between 50 cents to a dollar more for drinks made with plant-based milk. 'Customers can customise any beverage on the menu with a non-dairy milk, including soymilk, coconut milk, almond milk, and oat milk for an additional cost (similar to other beverage customisations such as an additional espresso shot or syrup),' a Starbucks spokesperson said in a statement. 'Pricing varies market by market.' The spokesperson added that the coffee chain respects customers' right to voice their opinions 'so long as it does not disrupt our store operations.' James was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as the farmer in 1995 film Babe and became a vegan after starring in the film. He became a vegetarian in 1974. In 2017, he was charged with trespassing for interrupting an orca show at SeaWorld in San Diego.",
    "0917ebf37d72534b32b583842cc3c33e3278e213f245b9b20c5527e4": "Michael Gove has slapped down any suggestions of an emergency budget this summer to ease the cost of living crisis.  The Levelling Up Secretary flatly denied there would be an emergency budget and suggested the prime minister's words had been overinterpreted.  Boris Johnson raised hopes of an emergency package after the Queen's Speech when he told the Commons that he and the Chancellor would say more on the cost of living 'in the days to come'. It fuelled speculation that Rishi Sunak could deliver an emergency budget to help people cope with soaring bills.  However, sources close to Sunak quickly made clear that they knew nothing about it, and insisted no new measures were due before the autumn. Gove suggested commentators were 'chasing their own tails' and told Sky News: 'There won't be an emergency budget. It is sometimes the case that the words from a prime minister or minister are overinterpreted. 'The prime minister is right. We will be saying more and doing more in order to help people with the cost-of-living challenge we face at the moment, but that doesn't amount to an emergency budget. It is part of the work of government. 'Last night the prime minister convened a group of ministers - we have all done work on some of the things we could do to help. Those policy initiatives will be announced by individual departments in due course as they are worked up. 'It is part of the process for a government that is always and everywhere thinking of how we can help and how we can provide support, both short term and long term.' Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine described the issue as a 'complete shambles.' She added: 'Millions of families and pensioners are struggling to get by. They need more help now before things get even worse in the autumn. 'Instead all we get from this Conservative government is chaos and confusion. 'An emergency budget is needed now to cut taxes for ordinary families while taxing the super profits of oil and gas companies. That would be the fair and right thing to do.'  Johnson made his comments in a debate on the Queen's Speech, which contained 38 bills but no immediate plans for dealing with the cost of living crisis. He said: 'My right honourable friend the Chancellor and I will be saying more about this in the days to come. 'But at the same time as we help people, we need the legislative firepower to fix the underlying problems in energy supply, in housing, in infrastructure and in skills which are driving up costs for families across the country. 'And this Queen's Speech takes those issues head on. And above all, we are tackling the economic challenges with the best solution of all and that is an ever growing number of high wage, high skill jobs. Jobs, jobs, jobs.' An ally of the Chancellor told HuffPost UK there were 'no announcements as far as we are aware'. They added: 'Rishi has always been clear that we would set out plans for support on energy bills for autumn when we know what the [energy] price cap is going to be - but we're not there yet.'  ",

For many fitness lovers, leg day is often the least favourite of the week. But that's often because of the misconception that you have to push your body to the point of struggling to walk the next day. Instead, why not try a short but effective lower body workout?  David Wiener, training and nutrition specialist at Freeletics, has shared a five-minute circuit with HuffPost UK that can be added into your next gym session or practiced during spare moments of the day.  'Lower body exercises are beneficial and vital for making daily tasks, such as walking, easier on us. Performing these exercises not only improves your stability, but it is a chain reaction on the rest of your body for helping improve your strength and posture,' he says.  'Ultimately, improving your lower body workout routine will give youlean muscle and achieve a stronger and more toned lower body, including the calves, thighs, hamstring and glutes.'  Try the 'no glutes, no glory' workout today and you'll never* be tempted to skip leg day again. (*Well, until next week at least.) 1. Squat Jumps This exercise is great because it's an all over body work out, but especially good for the lower body. It can help build your muscle and enhance strength, as well as boost your cardiovascular fitness, tone your lower body, strengthen bones, boost your circulation and burn many calories. To do one:Start standing with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Point your toes slightly outwards. Always keep your back straight. Always keep hands off your body. Lower down until your hips are below knees. Jump up so both feet leave ground and then return to the starting position before repeating. Rest. 2. Lunges Lunges are a great exercise to increase the muscle mass in your lower body whilst building up your strength and toning. Not only this, they also help to improve your posture, balance and range of motion. Whilst a lot of exercises put strain on your spine, lunges help give your spine a chance to relax whilst working many of the larger muscles in the lower body. To do one:Start standing upright, with your hands on your hips. Always keep your shoulders above the hips. Step forward with one foot Keep your front foot flat on the ground. Bend your back knee so it touches the ground below your hip Alternate lunging leg for the desired number of reps. Rest 3. Squats Much like a jumping squat, a normal squat has similar benefits but not as much cardio. Whilst this exercise will of course not burn as many calories as a jumping squat, it is still a great exercise to put your quadricep group of muscles to work. There's a misconception that squats put too much pressure and strain on your knees, but squats will actually strengthen your knees and make them less prone to injury as you get older.To do one:Start standing with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Point your toes slightly outward. Always keep your back straight. Always keep hands off the body. Always keep weight toward your heels. Lower down until your hips sit below your knees and rise back up to the starting position Rest 4. Split Lunges Much like the normal lunge, split lunges are a great way to work your quads, glutes, hips and hamstrings. As they are a unilateral exercise (meaning they only train one side of your body at a time), they are proven to increase your balance and posture too. Not only this, your hip flexor muscles are most commonly tight, but performing split lunges will help you improve the mobility of these muscles.To do one:Start standing upright. Always keep your shoulders above the hips. Step forward with one foot. Keep your front foot flat on the ground. Bend your back knee to touch the ground below hip. Jump up to switch sides. Make sure your feet leave ground at same time.  Rest. 5. Table Twists To enhance the flexibility of your lower body and spine, table twists are simple to perform and will stretch out all the major muscle groups in your body, helping to boost flexibility and enhance range of motion.To do one:Start with your hands below your shoulders, heels below the knees, and hips on ground. Push up until your hips are in line with your shoulders and knees. Reach one hand up and behind you. Return to the starting position. Alternative sidesAlways keep your arms straight. Rest and repeat.

Whether it's a latte, mocha or an espresso, some of us like it so much, we have several cups a day. But how does this impact our health? Well, a new study suggests the type of coffee we select can make a difference.  Drinking coffee has been linked with raises levels of cholesterol in the blood. But the latest research suggests it could also be down to how you brew your coffee and your gender.  The findings highlight that drinking espresso was associated with the widest gender difference in cholesterol level; plunger (cafetiere) coffee was associated with the narrowest. Naturally occurring chemicals in coffee--diterpenes, cafestol, and kahweol--raise levels of cholesterol in the blood. Brewing method is influential, but until now, it's not been clear what impact espresso coffee might have, and in what quantities. So researchers sought out to compare espresso coffee with other brewing methods among adults aged 40 and older.  Those involved in the study were asked how many daily cups of coffee they drank--none, 1-2 cups; 3-5; and 6 or more--and what brew type they drank--filtered; plunger (cafetiere); espresso from coffee machines, pods, mocha pots, etc; and instant. Blood samples were taken, and height and weight measured. Information was also analysed on potentially influential factors: diet and lifestyle, including smoking, alcohol intake and physical activity; educational attainment; and whether type 2 diabetes had been diagnosed.  The data highlighted that the link between coffee and total cholesterol in their blood varied depending on brewing method, with significant sex differences for all brew types bar plunger coffee. Women drank an average of just under four cups of coffee every day whilst men drank an average of nearly five.  Drinking between three and five daily cups of espresso was significantly associated with increased serum total cholesterol [cholesterol in blood], particularly among the men. A daily tally of six or more cups of plunger coffee was also linked with higher cholesterol, to a similar degree in both sexes.  And getting through six or more cups of filtered coffee every day was associated with 0.11 mmol/l higher cholesterol among the women, but not among the men, when compared with those not drinking filtered coffee.  While instant coffee was associated with an increase in cholesterol in both sexes, this didn't rise with the number of cups drunk, when compared with those who didn't opt for coffee powder/granules. The researchers pointed out a couple of limitations to the study. Among the 21,083 participants they didn't specify a standard 'cup size'. And they noted that different types of espresso - from coffee machines, capsules, or mocha pots--are most likely to contain various levels of the key naturally occurring chemicals. 'Interestingly, coffee contains more than a thousand diverse phytochemicals. The intake of each compound also depends on the variety of coffee species, roasting degree, type of brewing method and serving size,' the researchers said.  'Coffee is the most frequently consumed central stimulant worldwide. Because of the high consumption of coffee, even small health effects can have considerable health consequences.' ",

Video and photos surfaced on Monday and quickly trended on Twitter as the actor celebrated his Tony nomination for best performance by a featured actor in a play. Jesse plays a gay baseball star who comes out and is confronted with media glare and teammate resentment. The show includes a shower scene that leaves him and others in the cast exposed.  Second Stage's Hayes Theatre has been enforcing safeguards to prevent leaks. Audience members' mobile phones are locked in cases until the end of the show, but guests are allowed to hold onto the cases during the performance, according to the venue's website. Jesse had previously said he was 'terrified' at the prospect of being naked on stage. As the images were going viral, an episode of Watch What Happens Live aired in which the actor downplayed the nudity in his Broadway debut. 'Everybody makes such a big deal,' he told host Andy Cohen. 'It's a body ... whatever.' The host then asked if it was 'better if you feel good about your penis?' 'I imagine so,' Jesse replied. 'I don't.' He said he was kidding about that.",

The monarch's ill-health meant Prince Charles took up her Queen's speech duties to mark the state opening of parliament in an unprecedented, last minute change. Nonetheless, the pomp and pageantry that marks the British head of state's biggest duty was undimmed - including the imperial state crown travelling in its own car to parliament. The crown, one of the 140 objects known as the crown jewels, is said to be priceless but has variously been estimated to be worth billions of pounds. The crown forms part of the regalia, which also includes the cap of maintenance and the sword of state. Tradition has dictated that the regalia travelled in their own gilded carriage, ahead of the monarch, escorted by senior members of the royal household from Buckingham Palace to the House of Lords.  But as part of a 'stripped back' affair, the crown has been shipped by chauffeur-driven limousine to Westminster. As a mark of the scaling back, in the hopes that the Queen could attend, two ceremonial maces were transported to the ceremony poking out of a car window. While the practice is long-standing, giving the crown its own ride - this year, to be placed in the spot where the Queen would have been sitting - struck a nerve, perhaps since it is set against the backdrop of the cost of living crisis.",
    "dbb0e1fa5bf8c24056104e0bdd0b0500e3bd57a01d4bf74b598ee209": "Elon Musk said on Tuesday that he would reverse Twitter's ban on former US president Donald Trump if he becomes the social media giant's owner. The Tesla CEO said he believes Twitter made a mistake in banning the Republican, who routinely used the website to enable hate, encourage violence and push lies. 'I think it was a morally bad decision to be clear and foolish in the extreme,' Musk said at a Financial Times event, adding that the ban 'alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice'. Twitter banned Trump amid the January 6, 2021, insurrection, citing the risk of further violence. Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat also banned him. 'I would reverse the permanent ban,' Musk said. 'I don't own Twitter yet. So this is not like a thing that will definitely happen, because what if I don't own Twitter?' Musk is in the process of buying Twitter for $44 billion, although the acquisition has not yet gone through. The billionaire has said he wants to make the website a platform for free speech, which has raised questions about whether he would allow extremists -- and Trump -- to voice hate unfettered. Trump told Fox News last month that even if Musk took over Twitter, the former president would not return to the site. He said he instead plans to stick with the sinking social media company he founded, Truth Social, which he has so far only used twice.  'I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,' Trump told the outlet, adding that he believes Musk is a 'good man' and will probably improve Twitter. The former president has a history of lies, however, so it's unclear whether he will actually stay off the site should Musk become its new owner.",
    "171dccfcbf49e0dacee752d336040c437acb491681dde90a1b6e4a5a": "1. The beginning of the Charles regency? Unquestionably, the most significant aspect of the Queen's speech was the absence of the Queen herself. Britain's heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and Prince William, his successor, took centre stage amid the pomp and pageantry of the opening of parliament on Tuesday, replacing the 96-year-old Queen Elizabeth who missed out, for the first time in almost 60 years, with health issues. The Queen's absence was marked by the imperial state crown placed on a velvet cushion in front of the empty space where she would have sat on her throne. Charles, the longest serving heir to the throne, made history as he read the 874 words of the Queen's speech for the first time, discharging his most kingly duties to date. It raises questions about whether this the start of the Charles regency, which would mean the Queen transferring her powers as monarch to her son and heir without having to abdicate under the Regency Act 1937. 2. Cost of living crisis? What cost of living crisis?  The Queen's speech contained 38 bills - setting out plans for changes to create a 'high-wage, high-skill' economy, and 'build the foundations for decades of prosperity'. But there was a lack of flesh on the bones over the pledge to 'ease the cost of living for families'. Perhaps trying to head off criticism at the pass, Boris Johnson appeared to suggest an announcement was imminent - before Downing Street was forced to deny the government is planning an emergency package of help. Sending chancellor Rishi Sunak something of a hospital pass, Johnson told the Commons: 'My right honourable friend the Chancellor and I will be saying more about this in the days to come.'   Sources close to Sunak appeared blindsided, and insisted no new measures were due before the autumn.      One ally of the chancellor told HuffPost UK: 'Rishi has always been clear that we would set out plans for support on energy bills for autumn when we know what the [energy] price cap is going to be - but we're not there yet.'   3. Beergate neuters Starmer Whether or not 'beergate' is a 'non-story', it's having an impact in Westminster. A day after Keir Starmer committed to stepping down as Labour leader if he is fined by police over an allegation he broke coronavirus laws, his travails were seized on as good sport by Tories. Opening proceedings in the Commons on the first day of the new parliamentary session, ex-Tory minister Graham Stuart spoke about the history of his Beverley and Holderness constituency's electoral controversies. He said: 'Free beer and cash were the electoral controversies then, as opposed to say, beer and curry today. Never, Mr Speaker, never in the history of human conflict has so much karma come from a korma.' Even Boris Johnson - remember, he's the man who has already been fined over breaking the lockdown rules he came up with - felt he could mock Starmer by referring to him as the 'Leader of the Opposition of the moment'. While being ribbed by Tories is to be expected, perhaps more worrying for Starmer was the apparent lack of enthusiasm among Labour MPs. 4. It's a very odd affair in 2022 The Queen's speech in May last year, with the pandemic still looming large, was an austere and pared-down affair. But despite the cost of living crisis, the state opening of parliament has returned to its default setting of maximum pomp. It might seem jarring to those having to choose between heating and eating. Here's some of the things that happen: the imperial state crown and other regalia travel ahead of the monarch in a carriage of their own. The monarch's elaborate gilded sovereign's throne was removed from the House of Lords, leaving just the consort's throne, almost identical but an inch shorter and some 30 years younger, for Charles. Charles delivered the speech to MPs and lords dressed in red ceremonial robes. While the ceremony offered a glimpse into the future, to a time when Elizabeth II's reign will inevitably come to an end and Charles will be monarch, it may also be one of the last of its kind in a country where history and traditions are facing greater scrutiny than ever. 5. Parliament is a joke Another tradition of the day is for two government MPs to propose and second the loyal address to Her Majesty. It is in effect a comedy roast with parliamentarians the target. As mentioned, Graham Stuart kicked off proceedings with a series of jabs at Keir Starmer, but on purely comedic terms he was bested by Fay Jones, who represents Brecon and Radnorshire.  Jones joked about former Conservative MP Neil Parish, who quit the Commons after watching porn in the Commons. She said: 'If I do anything in this place, it will be to bang on about the importance of farming to this country. Hence why I welcome the measures in the gracious address which will see British produce on tables around the world. 'And even the Online Safety Bill, which will protect the unsuspecting farmer from nefarious internet videos.'",

    "a0ca12761eaf38c8d96c4556103abb8b2945a7627df8c025906d5f99": "When you are the new person on a team, it can be hard to tell if your boss's rude, brusque behavior is the result of a bad day or if they have a toxic reputation for creating an environment of fear and anxiety for their employees.  A difficult boss who is micromanaging can be reasoned with. But a toxic boss who lacks empathy can wreck your physical and mental health, causing you to lose sleep and dread each workday.  Sometimes, you may not be able to spot toxic behavior right away, but other times it is possible to identify a toxic boss who will drive you out and make your work life hell.  Here are some of the biggest warning signs that the friendly boss you met in a job interview may have a toxic side:  1. Your boss is quick to bad-mouth the person you just replaced  Angela Karachristos, a career coach who has worked in human resources, says one subtle sign new employees can notice is when their new boss bad-mouths the team members who have left.  'If you're new and your new boss is still hung up on why someone left, and is still taking it personally, that's one sign that you can spot early on,' Karachristos says. It brings 'to light that the manager doesn't separate their personal feelings about an employee from the work that they did or [the employee's] own need to move on.' The public bad-mouthing is also passive-aggressive because it signals 'that behavior is unacceptable' without telling you directly, Karachristos says. 'They are not telling you what their expectations are, but they are using the past employee as an example.'  2. Your boss will congratulate themselves, but will not praise anyone else One way to suss out toxic boss behaviour is to see how hard work and team wins get rewarded. Do you get a thoughtful message of support after completing a big project, or do you get radio silence?  If you are noticing that your boss says nothing when you win but makes a big deal about their own accomplishments, that's a worrying red flag of potential toxicity.  One type of toxic boss is a narcissistic boss. 'These are individuals who are basically incapable of caring for others or showing genuine interest in those working for them. Instead, they tend to be disconnected from others,' says Alan Cavaiola, a clinical psychologist and co-author of Impossible to Please: How to Deal With Perfectionist Coworkers, Controlling Spouses, and Other Incredibly Critical People. 'The narcissists will expect praise and adulation from others but are unable to give it to deserving staff.'  3. Your boss keeps ignoring you Be on guard if you notice that your new boss skips one-on-one meetings and does not show interest in helping you, even though you are their new team member.  If you feel as if you hardly exist to your boss, that's a sign of potential toxicity, says Lynn Taylor, a workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job. Under this kind of boss, 'you feel you constantly have to get their attention to provide feedback. Their door is often closed and conversations are rare,' Taylor says. 'You are led to believe they're just busy, but then you realise that they lack motivational managerial skills to say the least.' Taylor says you may encounter this challenging behaviour subtly or blatantly. 'When you're in a new job, it takes some time to process whether this is just a bad week for your boss, or their default behaviour,' she says.  4. Your boss only cares about whether you complete a deadline and doesn't give feedback on how you can grow   Toxic bosses prioritise output over your input. If your boss has a 'get it done' mentality, that could be a toxic red flag, says career coach Jasmine Escalera. 'It should be our boss's job to be thoughtful about how we can work best, what we need to get our jobs done, and how we can truly grow within our roles and throughout the company,' she says. 'Toxic bosses are all about getting work done, but do not focus on your own needs for development and work that taps into your strengths and skills.'  A good boss is one that communicates goals and is willing to have difficult conversations with their staff. 'Essentially a manager who has no conflict resolution skills will more than likely turn out to be toxic and won't have a psychologically safe working environment for their team,' says Minda Harts, founder of The Memo LLC, a career development company for women of colour. 5. Your boss changes their mind all the time without regard for the stress this causes to the team  A hallmark of a toxic boss is a lack of empathy. A good boss is mindful of the time and energy staff are putting in to meet their expectations.  But a toxic boss is willing to change their mind at a moment's notice, without any regard for the team's energy or stress levels. 'They get very hyper-focused on one thing,' Karachristos says. 'It becomes the sole focus of everybody's attention. There's not a clear plan, but it's all hands on deck, [but then] all of a sudden it's not anymore. This changing-mind situation can be very dangerous, because you are setting people up to fail.'  'That can cause a lot of anxiety on the team, because you don't know what is expected,' Karachristos continues. 'The first time you might be OK with it, but if it becomes a pattern, then you are always on edge because you are not sure what you are supposed to be doing.'  6. Your new co-workers act totally differently around your boss  It's normal for us to act more formally around our managers than around our peers. But if you notice a chilling pallor cast over staff when the boss enters a room, that's a warning sign to watch out for.  'If you notice that together the team talks freely and openly about problems and issues and whatever they are working on, but then when the boss is present, the conversations are much more cautious, or measured, or things are not brought to light out of fear that the boss is going to react in some way,' that's a warning sign, Karachristos says.  Colleagues being unwilling to share any thoughts about your boss is a sign, too. 'In the beginning, other colleagues will avoid chatting about the boss, raising your suspicions that they, too, are having similar issues,' Taylor says.  7. You notice the boss shows favouritism to certain team members If you realise your boss has a team favourite, that's a troubling toxic sign of a boss putting their own personal biases ahead of shared professional goals. Taylor shared an example: 'When you were interviewed, you liked the projects slated for you. But now your challenging boss is suddenly giving them to the proverbial 'teacher's pet,' and you're often the last to know.' A boss with favourites may also have colleagues they consider enemies. Watch out for the vague, subjective feedback these bosses give that is based on someone's personal attributes rather than on their ability to do the job well. 'I had one manager who kept referring to everything in vibes. 'I don't know, this employee gives me bad vibes.' That's so bad. That's not quantifiable. It's really meaningless,' Karachristos says.  8. Your boss puts you on edge and makes you scared to speak up Ultimately, one of the biggest signs that you are dealing with a toxic boss is how badly they are making you feel. If you start dreading the workday and you're only a few weeks in, that's not a feeling to ignore.  Under a toxic boss, 'you don't know when and where your manager will say or do something hurtful, so you're in a constant state of the unknown,' Taylor says. 'You wonder if it's you -- as this is a new job. You had chalked it up to your boss having a bad day, but now you're seeing a pattern.' Because toxic manager behaviour can be subtle or easy to explain away, it can be easier to notice changes in your own behaviour around them, says Lara Hogan, author of Resilient Management. 'Are you speaking up significantly less in team meetings that they're leading? Are you holding back from sharing information with them for fear of retaliation? Are you starting to choose your words extremely carefully around them? Are you avoiding being in a room or call alone with your manager?' Hogan says. 'These are all potential signals to you that your manager's behaviour might be having a significantly negative impact on you.'",
    "c24dbecd9995671d4f49286debd267f3c71fdbdc0027a9e25c9e7a51": "Vladimir Putin has endured significant losses in the 10 weeks since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February. The Russian president is not expected to call off the war any time soon, and vowed on Monday that Russia was going to continue fighting to rid Ukraine of 'torturers, death squads and Nazis'. But, as Putin continues to tout this false justification for a war which is definitely not going to plan, how much has he already lost? What Russia has lost so far The Kyiv Independent broke the losses down into these estimates, based on the Ukraine's Armed Forces as of May 10:   26,000 troops   1,170 tanks   2,808 APV (armed protected vehicles)   519 artillery systems   185 MLRS (multiple launch rocket system)   87 Anti-aircraft warfare   199 planes   158 helicopters   12 boats/cutters   380 UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle)   41 special equipment   19,980 vehicles and fuel tanks   94 cruise missiles   The real numbers may be higher, but the Ukraine Armed Forces have not had confirmation of any additional losses. These estimates are also much higher than previous suggestions that Russia had lost 15,000 troops since the war started - a stat shared by the defence secretary Ben Wallace on April 25. Speaking a few weeks ago, he added: 'At the start of this conflict Russia had committed over 120 battalion tactical groups, approximately 65% of its entire ground combat strength. 'As of now we assess around over 25% of these have been rendered not combat effective.' The Ministry of Defence (MoD) also claimed that Putin was hiding the true scale of troop losses from the Russian public. Without precision military weapons as well, it's believed that Russian planes, pilots and air to ground weapons have been missing the mark - literally - and obliterated Ukrainian civilians rather than attacking fellow military opponents. Why has Russia experienced such casualties? Experts believe Putin misjudged the war from the outset and assumed the Ukrainian population would largely welcome Russia's invasion. The MoD explained in its most recent update that Russia's 'underestimation of Ukrainian resistance' has led to 'demonstrable operational failings'. The UK officials also claimed this prevented Putin from announcing 'significant military success in Ukraine' during Victory Day, the Russian national holiday which was celebrated on Monday. The Kremlin was expected to use the symbolic occasion, which remembers the Red Army's victory over the Nazis in World War 2, to announce further military mobilisation - but it didn't happen. The MoD continued: 'Russia's invasion plan is highly likely to have been based on the mistaken assumption that it would encounter limited resistance and would be able to encircle and bypass population centres rapidly. 'This assumption led Russian forces to attempt to carry out the opening phase of the operation with a light, precise approach intended to achieve a rapid victory with minimal cost. 'The miscalculation led to unsustainable losses and a subsequent reduction in Russia's operational focus.' So what did Putin say in his latest speech? The Russian president stopped short of calling for new action from his troops, or further mobilisation. He only announced that extra aid would go to the children of killed or wounded soldiers. Putin did not announce victory - even in the destroyed Ukrainian city of Mariupol - but equally did not promise the conflict would end any time soon. He did not threaten further nuclear action and made no announcements about being at war with the west, despite heavily criticising Europe and the US for sending aid to Ukraine in recent weeks. His speech was actually much more low-key compared to his previous statements related to the war and Russia's so-called opponents. The parade in Moscow was also more modest than previous years even though, according to Russian media, 11,000 troops and 131 armoured vehicles took part. According to the New York Times, Putin might be concerned there is not enough public support for the war efforts to push anything too extreme on the country, as troops run low on morale and the west's sanctions on Russia come into effect.",

That led to speculation that Rishi Sunak could deliver an emergency budget to help people cope with soaring bills.

He said: 'My right honourable friend the Chancellor and I will be saying more about this in the days to come.

    "095632a339913136589d172963680ebd22b67bcd4e014a3931f9a22d": "Parliamentary authorities have warned MPs about the risk of 'falling masonry' outside the House of Commons, HuffPost UK can reveal. Officials have had to introduce 'exclusion zones' and a police officer is keeping watch along the north side of the historic Westminster Hall. The safety measures have been brought in after staff found stonework was 'degrading at a faster rate than expected'. The hall is the oldest building on today's parliamentary estate and has been the scene of historic events, including the state trials of William Wallace, Sir Thomas More, Guy Fawkes and Charles I. Many notable occasions of lying-in-state have also taken place in the hall including William Gladstone, King George V, Winston Churchill and the Queen Mother. But in a damning indictment of the condition of the building's exterior, measures have had to be brought in to protect staff walking by from 'falling masonry'.  An email to MPs, seen by HuffPost UK, said: 'Following a survey of the north facade of Westminster Hall, the area has been identified as degrading at a faster rate than expected with a risk of stone fall identified. Additional safety measures have been put in place. 'Following tactile inspections, mitigation is required to protect the immediate area below from falling masonry. Temporary exclusion zones have been formed using a flexible barrier system to the East and West of the main entrance.' The email was sent to MPs yesterday, the day before the biggest event in the parliamentary calendar - the State Opening of Parliament in which Prince Charles delivered the Queen's Speech.  They said the measures would remain in place until 'protective scaffolding' is installed, due at the start of the summer recess or 'earlier if possible'. MPs were then warned to take 'particular care' in the area and avoid the cordoned off areas. Figures released earlier this year revealed there had been 15 incidents in the last three years in which stonework had come crashing down. In April 2018, a football sized chunk of masonry broke away from a stone angel on parliament's Victoria Tower and plummeted 230ft to the ground. And in October 2017 an MP's car windscreen was smashed when a piece of masonry fell from a building.  Despite being one of the world's most iconic heritage sites, the palace is in a state of disrepair and urgently needs major restoration works.  A recent report found the works needed to save the palace could cost up to PS22 billion and last 76 years. But the project has been subject to a number of set backs and a desire from some MPs to remain in the historic building. It comes after HuffPost UK revealed that renovation work had to be halted and the Health and Safety Executive launched an investigation after a asbestos leak last October. Up to 117 people were potentially exposed to asbestos in the leak over four days during works on the Speaker's bedrooms. A UK parliament spokesperson said on Tuesday: 'Following a survey of the north facade of Westminster Hall, a risk of stone fall has been identified. 'As a result, additional safety mitigations are being implemented whilst investigations continue and conservation takes place. 'We work hard to keep parliament safe for both the members of the public that visit and for the staff and parliamentarians that work here. Where issues are identified we act quickly to address them.'",

The end of season five of the reality show saw the realtor caught up in all sorts of drama as she faced accusations she'd attempted to bribe a seller into working with her instead of colleague Emma Hernan - something Christine has vehemently denied. During a cast reunion episode, which dropped on Netflix on Friday, brokerage boss Jason Oppenheim subsequently said that 'right now there's not a place for her at the Oppenheim group'.  After her image was also removed from the brokerage's website, Christine has now offered her own explanation, insisting it was actually her decision to leave.  Commenting on a TikTok video, she said: 'Of course there's no place for me. I terminated my contract weeks ago prior to filming.' 'I have my own company now lol,' she added in reference to her new real estate venture, Real Open, which she announced last month.  Christine also made similar comments during an appearance on E! News' Daily Pop, saying: 'I am my own broker now, so I've been working on that. I terminated my contract, yes, and started my own brokerage.' However, Christine was not pressed directly on the accusations made against her at the end of the season.  Jason previously said during the reunion: 'We've texted and we haven't really addressed this situation. She hasn't reached out to talk about it. I know that she has some thoughts on it. 'Right now, there's not a place for her at The Oppenheim Group,' he continued. 'In the future, if she takes real estate seriously, if I can get an understanding of her perspective on things, if she changes her behaviour, if she brings in a big listing - there's a lot of reasons where I could consider her having a place at The Oppenheim Group but I have to say right now, there isn't a place.' However, it does not look like Christine's departure from the company necessarily means the end of her time on Selling Sunset.  'It means we might have to get a little creative when it comes to the new season, because it's going to be like a battle of the brokerages, so it will be fun,' she told Daily Pop.  During the interview Christine also addressed claims she had used Covid as an excuse to skip the cast reunion after she was allegedly pictured on the set of a shoot the next day.  'I did test positive [for Covid],' Christine insisted. 'I had a campaign due the next day. Like, I gotta get my bag at the end of the day. So, I was fine. I didn't miss out on anything.'

Some people joked, 'Theresa would have danced' - presumably a reference to the former prime minister Theresa May's infamous dance moves - and there were also requests for 'a BTS from the 2020 parties' and a 'TikTok on your hair routine babes'. Amid the witty asides there were plenty of comments simply stating, 'resign'. On a more serious note, one user pointed out: 'Country going into recession so the government made a TikTok to help us.' Johnson is not the only minister on the platform - culture secretary Nadine Dorries set up her account several weeks ago, sharing her ideas about the UK's media landscape and unpacking various political events including the Queen's Speech. She made a small faux pas during a video in April, when she accidentally told fellow TikTokers that you could 'downstream' your movies. TikTok mostly attracts Gen Zers - those born between 1997 and 2012 - and says 60% of its users come from this age group. It boomed throughout the pandemic and is known for its short, snappy video content which is tailored to each user's interests.",
    "5d7bd27579dd94295cd9719dc7f8950cddc5f60e90bdb3d580b80298": "The Conservatives have watered down plans to ban conversion therapy, meaning over-18s can be subject to it as long as they provide consent. The government has repeatedly said it considers conversion therapy to be a 'abhorrent' practice and the pledge to ban it was included in today's Queen's Speech. However, it has now emerged that the ban will only protect over-18s who 'do not consent and who are coerced or forced to undergo conversion therapy practices'. All under 18s will continue to be protected from the ban regardless of their circumstances. A document outlining the Conversion Therapy Bill stated that the government would introduce a 'criminal offence banning non-physical conversion therapies to complement existing legislation which protects people from acts which inflict physical harm' But it added: 'The offence will protect under-18s, regardless of circumstance, and over-18s who do not consent and who are coerced or forced to undergo conversion therapy practices.' Asked to justify the changes, the prime minister's official spokesperson said: 'This is a difficult area and we need to strike the right balance. 'It is obviously abhorrent to force this on anyone, but it is a complex area that needs careful management -- that's why I think it's important to wait for the full details of the bill.' The spokesman also cited the need for religious teachings to not be inadvertently affected by any ban.  'It's important that the freedom to express religious teachings is not affected by the ban, individuals will still be able to access support and counsel from religious leaders should they wish,' they said. 'But that's a separate issue to seeking to force this abhorrent practice on people.' The government has also been criticised for not pushing ahead with any form of conversion therapy for transgender people. Instead it has said 'separate work' needs to be done on the issue of transgender conversion therapy, but that separate legislation will not be introduced. 'The government will continue doing more policy work on that front before providing further updates,' the spokesperson said. The decision to not include trans people in the Queen's Speech was roundly criticised by some campaigners. Charity Mermaids said the Queen's Speech 'failed trans people'. 'The government has committed, yet again, to ban conversion therapy...despite being the one legislative promise to the LGBT+ community.' Stonewall tweeted: This pared down bill will end up protecting nobody.' 'We urge the UK government to not play politics with LGBTQ+ lives and listen to the experts - including NHS England and the British Psychological Society - and introduce a ban that protects ALL LGBTQ+ people.'",
    "7209beeb7471e58bd53156081ed8a01f23df029ac0516d89a6c4f700": "Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer were caught smiling at one another in a rare - and surprising - moment on Tuesday. The prime minister and the leader of the opposition are rarely seen together away from PMQs, where they furiously take down one another's arguments. This time, however, they were caught on camera chatting causally while on their way to listen to the Queen's Speech for the State Opening of Parliament. The BBC's commentators even noticed the incident during the live footage, with presenter Huw Edwards pointing out: 'That was a little more jolly than I would have expected really.' The friendliness is particularly remarkable because both Starmer and Johnson are currently under police investigation for potentially breaching Covid lockdown rules at different events. Starmer was one of the most vocal critics about Johnson's involvement in partygate - the series of gatherings said to have taken place in Downing Street throughout the pandemic - only for the Tories to then push for a new probe into the Labour leader's own supposed rule-breaking one night last year. Starmer then announced on Monday that he would resign from his position if the police did fine him for breaching social distancing rules in the so-called beergate row. In turn, this has put pressure on the prime minister. He has already been fined once for attending his own birthday party in June 2020, and could face an additional three fines for other Downing Street events, but he is refusing to resign. Johnson has also triggered controversy in the past through his personal attacks on the Labour leader, and even falsely blamed Starmer for not prosecuting Jimmy Savile when he was director of public prosecutions. Despite all of this tension in the background and the two opponents' careers potentially hanging on a thread, the men chatted with relative ease as they walked from the House of Commons to the House of Lords this morning. Twitter didn't wait long to turn it into a meme though, with users sharing takes on what it was really like between the two politicians in that moment. The two party leaders weren't the only ones who were ridiculed for their role in the State Opening of Parliament either. Prince Charles, who was filling in for the Queen today, was mocked for his sombre delivery of the Queen's Speech - and his rather unamused expression.",
    "38984708f4fff8497f03cd986fc92f90ed88c96df2b1fe63b2f62f4b": "As a lover of Roman mythology, Boris Johnson will be well acquainted with the tale of Emperor Nero fiddling while his city burned. Regardless of the fact that the story is probably untrue, it has come to symbolise any out-of-touch leader unwilling to take the necessary action to help his people when they are struggling. So it was with today's Queen's Speech. A higher-than-normal 38 pieces of legislation were unveiled, ranging from the Levelling Up And Regeneration Bill to the Brexit Opportunities Bill. However, there was nothing to address the biggest challenge facing families up and down the country - a cost of living crisis which is only going to get worse in the months ahead. In his introduction to the legislative programme, the prime minister acknowledged the problem - but insisted the best approach was to take a long-term approach to tackling it.  'For every pound of taxpayer's money we spend on reducing bills now, it is a pound we are not investing in bringing down bills and prices over the longer term,' the PM said.   'And that if anything, this moment makes clear our best remedy lies in urgentlydelivering on our mission to turbo charge the economy, create jobs and spreadopportunity across the country.' Which is all very laudable, but of absolutely no use to families wondering how they'll make their budget stretch until the next pay day, or those on benefits having to make the agonising choice between heating their home and feeding their kids. As Dan Paskins of Save the Children said: 'The cost of living crisis is an emergency the UK government should be dealing with right now. The Queen's Speech was a major opportunity to support those most affected by rising costs, and the government didn't take it.' The PM is also taking a massive political gamble as well. With the Tories already trailing Labour in the polls, and the measures the government has already announced widely seen as insufficient, Johnson is hoping that voters - and Tory MPs - give him the time he wants to turn the economy around. Johnson will be well aware that things did not end well for Nero after he lost the support of his people and his closest aides abandoned him.  The PM will be keen to ensure that the same fate does not befall him. ",
    "18abe590b2b9b5320f8b53787e95002d81ab3c405efd9ab0ffe82950": "The Tories were accused of being 'out of touch' after they ditched their flagship employment bill from today's Queen's Speech. Despite dozens of promises to deliver legislation to boost workers' rights, long-awaited reforms were absent from Tuesday's announcement. They included a clamp down on sexual harassment and workplace pregnancy discrimination as well as making flexible working the default, unless employers had a good reason to refuse it.  Labour's Tulip Siddiq told HuffPost UK that BAME workers and mothers would 'pay the price'. The shadow economic secretary to the treasury said: 'Yet again this out-of-touch Conservative government has failed to deliver on its promise of making flexible working the default. 'Sadly, I'm not surprised - Jacob Rees-Mogg's refusal to even consider greater flexibility for civil servants, demonstrates this government's disdain for modern working practices. 'It's BAME workers and mothers - who too often have to sacrifice their career to care for their children - who will pay the price for the government's failure to bring forward an employment bill. 'Businesses will lose out too - research from Ernst and Young found that 57 per cent of businesses boosted their productivity due to introducing greater flexibility during the pandemic. 'It's time for the government to implement my flexible working bill, supported by MPs from across the house, to make flexible working a right for all.' In 2019, the government said its employment bill would make the country 'the best place in the world to work' after Brexit. However, more than two years after that pledge, no employment bill has been published by the government. Other policies floated as part of the legislation included a single agency to enforce employee rights, ensuring tips go to workers in full, a right for workers to request a more predictable contract, the right to a week's leave for unpaid carers and paid leave for parents with children needing neonatal care. The Trades Union Congress [TUC] said 'bad bosses' would be celebrating over the government's 'broken promise' and accused ministers of 'turning their back' on working people. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'The prime minister promised to make Britain the best place in the world to work. But he has turned his back on working people. 'Today, bad bosses up and down the country will be celebrating. 'No employment bill means vital rights that ministers had promised - like default flexible working, fair tips and protection from pregnancy discrimination - risk being ditched for good. 'And it means no action on the scourge of insecure work and ending exploitative practices like zero-hours contracts and fire and rehire.'",
    "a5c8dbea4026f3ce5aecffc98a3430b3e05947e46286a23564bf6a9d": "Boris Johnson ruled out any immediate help for families struggling with the cost of living crisis as he outlined his government's plans for the next 12 months. The prime minister unveiled a staggering 38 bills in the Queen's Speech - but there were no emergency measures to tackle the misery caused to millions by soaring bills. Instead, he said the government would 'turbo charge the economy' over the long term in order to create thousands of new, well-paid jobs. In his introduction to the government's legislative programme, Johnson said ministers had already announced PS22bn-worth of measures to help bring down energy and council tax bills. He added: 'But we must also remember that for every pound of taxpayer's money we spend on reducing bills now, it is a pound we are not investing in bringing down bills and prices over the longer term. 'And that if anything, this moment makes clear our best remedy lies in urgentlydelivering on our mission to turbo charge the economy, create jobs and spreadopportunity across the country.' Johnson said it was important for the government to balance the books following the economic damage caused by the pandemic. And he insisted his administration was prepared to step in to help those struggling to make ends meet if necessary. He said: 'I know people are struggling with their bills, and that they are anxiousabout the future. But we will get the country through it just as we got through Covid-19, with every ounce of ingenuity and compassion and hard work. 'While we must keep our public finances on a sustainable footing - and we cannot completely shield people from the fallout from global events - where we can help, we will. 'And over the coming months we will continue examining what more we can do to ease the pressures on hard-working people and families. 'From the moment I became prime minister, my mission has been to deliver for the British people. Over the remainder of this parliament, this government will work night and day to ensure we do just that.' Among the legislation announced in the Queen's Speech, which was delivered by Prince Charles after the Queen was forced to pull out over health concerns, are a Levelling Up And Regeneration Bill, a Public Order Bill, a Schools Bill and a Brexit Opportunities Bill.",
    "574b2d0729c42a803f8e556f934574a555a0004e8d1b5711d8d6173c": "Hair and beauty aficionados or watchers of Bridgerton might have noticed something in the way of a 'hack' - that of applying oil on the scalp to stimulate healthy hair growth. The trick has been garnering attention on social media, with the moniker 'hair slugging' and 'hair oiling' taking hold on TikTok. This describes the art of rubbing a penetrative oil (as opposed to a hair shine or non-greasing oil) and massaging it around the head. And now it's gone mainstream - amassing more than 35.8 million views and counting, with many touting it as a new and revolutionary method set to change your hair game. But actually, it's not new at all. South Asians have been practicing 'hair slugging,' or a thel maalish as we know, it for centuries. We even saw it on Bridgerton as Edwina had her hair lovingly massaged by her sister on the hit Netflix show, an ode to a 5,000-year-old tradition, started through the Indian science of Ayurveda. Many South Asians still adhere to the ritual, including me, and it's probably what contributes to our lush, long tresses in the community - in fact, India is the top global supplier of human hair to be made into wigs, so clearly we're getting healthy hair right.  For many, a thel malish holds many significances, including nostalgia, special moments with a loved one, or even difficult memories that were overcome.  For me, the smell of one particular brand (Amla thel, for those who are familiar), evokes the strongest memories of my late grandmother, whose hair was always sleeked back with the thel, the fragrance adorning her saree. When I catch a whiff of it, I'm bought back to wonderful memories of her.  So, seeing products like Amla thel lined up in Superdrug and the like under 'deep conditioning treatments' feel somewhat uncanny.  I'm glad we have more options to buy items like this in the mainstream, and that the practice is gaining recognition for all its benefits. But it's not a new thing started by beauty influencers and mammoth brands.  For many, the easy acceptance of this trend when it's boosted by Western content creators and brands, but was shunned when we went to school with greasy hair, sparks difficult feelings. Many were bullied for greasy hair and internalised shame and embarrassment for adhering to a cultural practice. Others, as children, hated having to sit still as their mother or another matriarch (it's usually practiced by women) thoroughly (and painfully if you have curly hair) rubbed the oil from their fingertips to the scalp in circular motion.  Now, we'd be glad to get a thel maalish from a loved one. And it's cool that we can simply pop down to a local drug store to pick one up. We only wish it was normal to mask your hair in oil back in the day too, and that it's now given credit where credit is due. Because South Asians truly do have enviable hair. ",
    "6afda82ef5cddf78d70d5eca4a76c19a8f7357a711569aa6dc64549b": "Boris Johnson, fresh from heavy losses at last week's local elections, has unveiled his legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session. The government wants to focus on economic growth in the wake of the pandemic, as voters grapple with the cost of living crisis. The Queen's Speech, this year delivered by Prince Charles, revealed 38 Bills in total. Here is a run down of some of the key pieces of legislation being proposed. Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill The prime minister has tried to put reducing regional inequality at the centre of his leadership. This legislation, being led by Michael Gove, requires an annual report on progress to be published. The planning system will be reformed to give residents more involvement in local development. And it will help towns force landlords to rent out empty shops to regenerate high streets. Local residents will also be given more of a say over changing street names. The government says it will also ensure 'everyone can continue to benefit from al fresco dining'. Bill of Rights Dominic Raab's Bill will replace the Human Rights Act, which put the European Convention on Human Rights into UK domestic law. Many Conservatives have complained that it expanded human rights protections too far, including limiting the government's ability to deport foreign criminals. The new legislation, the government says, will curb the 'incremental expansion of a rights culture'. A key part of the Bill is also 'defending freedom of speech'. This will be done by 'promoting greater confidence in society to express views freely', according to the government. Public Order Bill This is a plan to crack down on what the government says are disruptive 'guerrilla protests'. It will outlaw tactics such as protesters 'locking on' to public transport infrastructure or gluing themselves to roads, which have been adopted by campaign groups such as Insulate Britain. Stop and search powers for police will also be extended to search for and seize articles related to protest-related offences. It represents a bid to revive measures which were previously put forward under the now-passed Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill but had to be scrapped after being knocked back by the House of Lords. Schools Bill The education package is also being sold as an attempt at levelling up, helping every child fulfil their potential 'wherever they live'. It creates new regulations for academies and introduces a direct National Funding Formula, so that each mainstream school will be allocated funding on the same basis. Schools will also be required to publish an attendance policy and creates a 'children not in school' register. The current teacher misconduct regime will be strengthened, with new powers to investigate teachers who accused of misconduct. Brexit Freedoms Bill The government wants to 'seize the opportunities' of the UK leaving the EU to 'enable economic growth'. The main purpose of the legislation is to allow the government to amend, repeal or replace the large amounts of retained EU law without having to propose new primary legislation each time. It will also assert the sovereignty of parliament by removing the supremacy of retained EU law over UK law in the legal system. Conversion Therapy Bill This will ban the practise of so-called conversion therapy, which seeks to suppress or change a person's sexual orientation. But it will not ban conversion therapy targeted at trans people, a decision which triggered a significant backlash from many Tory MPs, as well as opposition parties and LGBT groups, when the plan was leaked last month. Media Bill This legislation is designed to allow the government to privatise Channel 4, which the government says will enable it to 'continue to thrive and grow'. But the plan faces significant opposition. Many Tory MPs are unhappy with the idea and Labour has warned it could lead to the channel being 'gobbled up' by US media companies. Harbours (Seafarers' Remuneration) Bill This is about P&O. The ferry company caused outrage in March when it sacked 800 staff and replaced them with cheaper agency workers. This legislation will allow ports to refuse access to ferry services that do not pay an equivalent to the National Minimum Wage. Other Bills include: Transport Bill Provides the new 'Great British Railways' body with the powers it needs to take control of the railway system. Energy Security Bill Focused on paving the way for new, low-carbon technologies and growing the consumer market for electric heat pumps. Will also appoint Ofgem as the new regulator for heat networks and extend the energy price cap. Draft Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Bill Cracks down on 'subscription traps' and fake reviews, strengthens protections for consumers using Christmas savings clubs. Also gives the Competition and Markets Authority the ability to decide for itself when consumer law has been broken, and to issue penalties for those breaches. UK Infrastructure Bank Bill Establishes the bank in law, with clear objectives to support regional and local economic growth and deliver net zero. Non-Domestic Rating Bill This will shorten the business rates revaluation cycle from five to three years from 2023. Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill Requires manufacturers, importers and distributors of smart devices to comply with minimum security standards. Electronic Trade Documents Bill This will put electronic trade documents on the same legal footing as their paper equivalents, which the Government says will cut down on 'wasteful paperwork' and 'needless bureaucracy'. High Speed Rail (Crewe - Manchester) Bill Provides the powers to build and operate the next stage of the High Speed Two (HS2) network between Crewe and Manchester. Draft Audit Reform Bill This will establish a new statutory regulator, the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority, and empower it to enforce directors' financial reporting duties. Procurement Bill This will enshrine in law the objectives of public procurement including: delivering value for money, maximising public benefit, treating suppliers equally and without discrimination, and acting, and being seen to act, with integrity. Financial Services and Markets Bill Revokes retained EU law on financial services and updates regulators' objectives to bring about a greater focus on growth and international competitiveness. Data Reform Bill The legislation will reform the UK's data protection regime, replacing the regulations inherited from the European Union with a system 'focused on privacy outcomes rather than box-ticking'. Trade (Australia and New Zealand) Bill The legislation will ensure the UK can comply with the obligations set out in the free trade deals struck with Australia and New Zealand. Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Bill The new laws will remove EU measures which prevent the development and marketing of 'precision bred' plants and animals using techniques such as gene editing. Higher Education Bill Could be used to set minimum qualification requirements for a person in England to be eligible for student loans to go to university, effectively restricting access. Will also create a lifelong loan entitlement to support people to retrain. Social Housing Regulation Bill Aimed at improving tenants' rights in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster, with beefed-up powers for the regulator. Renters Reform Bill This will seek to abolish so-called 'no fault' evictions by removing Section 21 of the Housing Act 1988 but also seek to reform possession grounds for landlords, strengthening them for repeated cases of rent arrears. Social Security (Special Rules for End of Life) Bill This will aim to allow more people nearing the end of their life to access three disability benefits: Personal Independence Payment, Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance. National Security Bill This will reform existing espionage laws in a bid to tackle modern threats and bring in new offences to target state-backed sabotage, foreign interference, stealing trade secrets and assisting a foreign intelligence service. Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill This will seek to crack down on illicit finance, including by creating new powers to seize crypto assets more quickly and increasing powers to check information on the Company Register. Modern Slavery Bill This will aim to increase support for victims of human trafficking and modern slavery, including by toughening sanctions for breaches of Slavery and Trafficking Prevention and Risk Orders. Online Safety Bill Carried over from the previous parliamentary session, the legislation includes measures aimed at forcing online giants to take responsibility for protecting users and removing illegal content. Draft Victims Bill The legislation will enshrine the Victims' Code in law and improve the support they receive - particularly for victims of sexual violence, domestic abuse and serious violence. Draft Protect Duty Bill In the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing the legislation will introduce new requirements for certain public locations and venues to draw up plans to respond to terrorism. Draft Mental Health Act Reform Bill Overhauls existing powers to protect patient liberty and prevent those with learning difficulties from being detained without their consent. Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill Creates a system for immunity from prosecution for Troubles-related offences and sets up a new Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery to enable individuals and family members to seek and receive information about what happened to their loved ones. Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Bill The legislation will enhance and develop the Ulster Scots/Ulster British tradition in Northern Ireland while recognising and protecting the Irish language, based on measures in the New Decade, New Approach Deal. Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill The law will ban live exports, tackle puppy smuggling and prohibit keeping primates as pets without a licence. Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill Seen as part of the Government's culture war agenda, the legislation will introducing new freedom of speech and academic duties on higher education providers, their constituent colleges and students' unions. Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions Bill Prevents public bodies effectively running their own foreign policies by pursuing campaigns to boycott goods from certain countries. The move comes in the wake of efforts by councils to boycott goods from Israel.",

On Tuesday, the ceremonial Queen's Speech - which will actually be delivered by her heir Prince Charles this time - unpacks what legislation Downing Street will be focusing on in the upcoming session of parliament. Drag queen River Medway, a former contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race UK, joined forces with LGBTQ+ charity Mermaids to criticise No.10's decision not to ban trans conversion therapy earlier this year. The video begins in a jokey tone, with Medway dressed up in regal drag in a mock-up of the House of Lords. She addresses the camera with: 'My lords, ladies, gentle thems and theybes, please be seated.' The drag queen then dives into Boris Johnson's decision to only ban gay conversion therapy, which has been widely condemned across the political spectrum. Medway explains: 'My government has royally messed up, deciding that protecting trans people from a ban on conversion practises is not a priority - despite the fact that the government knows how damaging it is and knows trans people are at a higher risk than the rest of the LGBTQ community. 'Conversion practices take many forms, from psychiatric to religious, or cultural interventions. 'They can be carried out by anyone, including community leaders and family members. 'But one thing they all have in common is that they are extremely cruel. and they do not work.' Conversion therapy aims to suppress or change a person's sexual orientation. It is also used in a bid to make trans people's gender identity correspond with the sex they had at birth. NHS England has described the practice as 'unethical and potentially harmful', while mental health charity Mind said it has a 'terrible impact on a person's mental health'. Back in the video, Medway continues: 'My government promised to protect trans people. It has broken that promise. One cannot get involved in constitutional matters - I am the queen, after all - but you can do something about this. 'Write to my ministers and your members of parliament and ask them to speak up for a ban that protects trans people. 'A government should be accountable to its people. So tell them they've got this one wrong. 'I pray that they listen to you and keep trans in the ban. Now can I get an A-Them?'  The government first pledged to ban conversion therapy back in 2018 under former prime minister Theresa May.  Only in October last year, the prime minister's wife Carrie Johnson promised a reception at a Tory Party conference that the government was 'completely committed' to LGBTQ+ rights. Boris Johnson defended his decision to exclude trans people from the conversion therapy ban in April, when he said there were 'complexities and sensitivities' when 'you move from the area of sexuality to the question of gender'.",

A 90-second trailer for Avatar: The Way Of Water dropped online on Monday, picking up with the natives of Pandora more than a decade after we last saw them.  The new film will follow the Sully family, documenting the battles they fight and the tragedies they endure to keep each other safe. While the Avatar 2 trailer gives very little away in terms of plot, fans did get to see more of the stunning CGI that captivated audiences around the globe the first time around.  The film sees Zoe Saldana and Sam Worthington reprise their roles as Jake Sully and Na'vi Neytiri, while Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang are back as Dr Grace Augustine and Colonel Miles Quaritch. Kate Winslet will also join the cast of the sci-fi action adventure film.  Avatar went on to become the highest grossing film of all time when it was released in 2009 - a title it still holds to this day.

After winning for Norway with his signature tune Fairytale back in 2009, he's returned to the competition on several occasions, joining fellow Eurovision alum in various interval medleys over the years and even appearing as himself in the Netflix comedy Eurovision Song Contest: The Story Of Fire Saga. Looking back at his victory 13 years later, Alexander is still far from tired of his winning entry, instead insisting he feels 'more and more blessed' to have the 'worldwide hit and calling card' in his catalogue as time goes by. 'I love every time I get to perform it,' he tells HuffPost UK shortly before this year's Eurovision gets underway. 'Fairytale lets me have fun with music and experiment with new genres and styles every year. 'It's essentially an old-fashioned oom-pah tune with Tin Pan Alley chords, but people called it a 'modern tune' because I believed in it in the here and now. I will be forever grateful for the people who stream it and show it to their friends, so that it may live on and be discovered by new generations.'  In recent years, Alexander has made something of a u-turn in his life, relocating from Oslo to the US, where he's pursuing a lifelong dream and studying music composition for the screen at Columbia College in Chicago. Still, having returned as a Eurovision competitor for Norway in 2017, Alexander admits the contest is still something he'd return to for a third time - 'and a fourth... and a seventh!' - were the right song to come his way. Here's what else Alexander had to say when we asked him about all things Eurovision... What's your earliest memory of watching Eurovision?  Actually it was in 2008, the year before I won. If I like something, I've always been like a kid who points at the screen and says 'I wanna try that, too!'. I was also very inspired by Maria Haukaas Storeng, the Norwegian participant that year, who came fifth with Hold On Be Strong. I didn't think too much before starting writing Fairytale, specifically with Eurovision in mind. Have you always been a fan of Eurovision? How has your opinion of it changed over time? I've always been a huge fan. And I'm grateful for every time someone invites me to perform at a national selection or anything else connected to the Eurovision Song Contest. Do you have a favourite memory of being part of Eurovision? Honestly, what I love the most is being part of the medleys and interval acts. I love getting together with other Eurovision artists on stage! I loved being part of the Love, Love, Peace, Peace interval performance in Sweden in 2017. Mans Zelmerlow is not only a great Eurovision winner, but a great comedian, as it turned out. However, my most, most, most favourite moment was in Baku in 2012, when I performed along with [fellow winners] Lena, Dima Bilan and Marija Serifovic. What are your three all-time favourite Eurovision songs and why? Rise Like A Phoenix by Conchita Wurst because it hits me in the feels every single time. Heroes by Mans Zelmerlow is beautiful because it's perfect. And Amar Pelos Dois by Salvador Sobral is beautiful because it's imperfect. Who are you rooting for at Eurovision in 2022 and why? I'm rooting for Norway because they are hardworking wolves - on social media as well as on stage. And because they've got a really cool concept behind their song. Why is Eurovision still so important? The more spread out our entertainment choices become, and the more streaming options we get, the more we get into our own custom-made bubbles. So we need something like Eurovision to unite us once in a while! Follow Alexander on TikTok here. 'I can't complain about the warm welcome the TikTok community has given me, since I started last year,' he explains. 'But I'll never do the dances. No, sir.' We'll be publishing an interview with a different Eurovision legend every day leading up to this year's live final on Saturday 14 May.

The singer was approached to be part of the 2019 judging panel but decided not to participate because of two specific rules. Speaking to Radio Times, Sophie said that due to the success of her hit song Murder On The Dancefloor - which was the most played track in Europe in 2002 - she had a 'conversation' about becoming a competition judge. 'I had a very small baby that I was still feeding, and they wouldn't let me bring it along,' she said. She then joked: 'I'm pretty sure the baby would have been impartial but, you know what, I think part of what I like about Eurovision is that it has very much got its rules... it's kooky.' As well as the apparent 'no babies' rule, Sophie also revealed that the judges have to remain silent throughout the judging process. 'We weren't going to be allowed to speak while we were watching it either,' she revealed. 'And I thought, 'I can't watch Eurovision in silence'.' Sophie added that Eurovision had always been a part of her life since she was 'tiny' and watched the programme with her parents as a child. 'My parents always watched Eurovision and I remember watching it during the 80s when I was in single digits and being pretty fascinated by what I saw,' she said. She added that the 'political undertones' to Eurovision, and Britain's famous lack of success in recent years, was 'part of the fun'. 'We should probably brace ourselves for another 'nul points' score,' she said. 'There have always been political undertones (to the voting), which again, is part of the fun. We quite enjoy that, I think. 'It's part of the reason Britain treats it in an almost ironic way, and I don't think it will ever lose that, but some of the songs that are good can have a life outside of Eurovision and be treated as legitimate hits.' This year's contest will be held in Turin, Italy and will see 32-year-old TikTok star Sam Ryder representing the UK with his song Space Man. Despite Sophie's reservations about our chances of success, Sam is currently the bookies second favourite to win. According to Oddschecker - who compare betting odds from around 25 of the UK's bookies - Sam has overtaken the representatives for both Italy and Sweden, and is now second favourite to win Eurovision on behalf of the UK for the first time in 25 years. Ukraine is still the firm favourite, where they'll be represented by Kalush Orchestra with their song Stefania. The Eurovision final airs on Saturday at 8pm on BBC One, BBC Radio 2 and BBC iPlayer.

    "a9789123e38aca37d6b51ca1ef761c28f06bdf5c464057eb5802dcf2": "A fourth-dose Covid jab might be on the cards for the general population after a UK trial found it increased protection against the virus. The majority of people in the UK received their third vaccine in the winter when the government rolled out the booster programme in response to the huge surge in infections triggered by the Omicron variant. A small category of the public have been able to access a fourth dose since April, but - based on new research - it looks like this could be rolled out to more people in the autumn. Does a fourth dose increase protection? Yes - the results of a new UK trial, published in Lancet Infectious Diseases, revealed that two weeks after their fourth jab, the vaccines were 'well-tolerated' and 'boosted immunity' among the 133 study participants. Everyone in the study was vaccinated with either a dose of Pfizer or a half dose of Moderna approximately six months after their third jab. The study leader, Professor Saul Faust from the University of Southampton, said: 'We've demonstrated a fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccines can produce a substantial boost to both the antibody and cellular immunity when you give them more than six months after the third dose.' He continued: 'There was good boosting in all groups, particularly for the over-70s and the half dose of Moderna was slightly higher.'  There was a 1.6-fold increase in antibodies for those who received Pfizer and more than twofold increase for those who received the Moderna. 'Peak responses to the fourth dose were similar to, and possibly better than, peak responses after the third dose,' the experts also concluded. T-cells, an essential part of the immune system, were also boosted after the vaccine - suggesting long-term protection was increased alongside symptomatic infection, both in those over and under 70 years of age. Health secretary Sajid Javid said the study shows 'further evidence underlining the importance of people coming forward for their booster as soon as they are eligible'. Are there any downsides? Just like after the third dose, it appears that Covid antibodies wane quite quickly after injection. Prof. Faust also suggested that the surge of infections seen with the recent Omicron wave suggests most of the public will have been infected recently, and have high antibody levels - defeating the point of a fourth jab. He said those who had little waning of their immune responses before their fourth dose only saw a small increase in antibodies. He explained: 'That indicates there may be a ceiling, a maximum antibody level with the T-cell response effects.' Why can't everyone get a fourth dose now? Some nations - including Israel and Germany - have already rolled out a fourth dose. However, in the UK, the government will only make a decision based on the advice from the JCVI - Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. This independent panel identifies new variants of concern and potential pressure on hospitals. Downing Street has waited for the experts' nod before making a key move related to the vaccines, such as offering it to children, throughout the pandemic. So this particular study won't trigger an immediate response from Downing Street - especially as it only had a small number of participants. More research is needed to look at how the immune response fares over a longer time frame as well, before more people can access it. Who is currently eligible for a fourth dose? Adults aged 75 and over, along with residents in care homes for older adults and anyone aged 12 and over with weakened immune systems have been entitled to a fourth jab since April. Appointments can be booked three months after your previous dose, but the NHS recommends having the spring dose approximately six months later to maximise its effects. It has not yet been revealed who the government might extend the fourth jab to in the autumn. Should we keep getting boosters? Professor Danny Altmann, immunologist at Imperial College London, suggested that this new study shows how important it is to get another vaccine dose. He told The Guardian: 'Just because our first-generation vaccines wane rapidly and offer rather permeable protection nowadays, does not suggest we should give up and have no further boosters. 'On the contrary, many of us, even with high apparent antibody levels, actually show [little] protective neutralisation of Omicron, there is all the more urgency to use [fourth] doses - in all age groups - to boost levels back up into the protective range.' However, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol and a member of the JCVI, Adam Finn, suggested last month that anyone who is not yet middle-aged probably does not need a fourth dose. 'I think it's questionable whether young, healthy people will ever be offered another Covid vaccine beyond dose three - at least with the vaccines and variants we have now.' He added: 'You just don't achieve anything very useful by [further] immunising healthy young people with these vaccines because they rarely get sick - which the vaccines prevent.' Yet, he pointed out that this could all change in the future, if other more dangerous variants emerged. Vaccines also reduce long Covid symptoms, regardless of your age.",
    "aabd9f008f76a9816f5aa4d16373e1323190a8e0837b689a00039194": "Tesco's chairman has backed imposing a windfall tax on energy firms to help people who are feeling 'extremely stretched' by the cost of living crisis. John Allan said there was an 'overwhelming case' for a levy on the excess profits being enjoyed by companies as a result of the global spike in prices. The Labour Party has repeatedly called for a one-off tax on firms' profits to help ease the pressure on household bills, but Boris Johnson has repeatedly ruled it out, insisting it would prevent investment in green energy schemes. Last week Shell renewed demands for a windfall tax on the sector after it posted profits of PS7.2billion for the first three months of 2022. It followed BP, which announced an underlying profit of PS5bn earlier this month, more than double last year's figure and its biggest surplus in over a decade. Asked what he would like to see in the Queen's Speech, John Allan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'First of all, I think action to help people cope with a very, very sharp increase in energy prices. 'It's harder for people to mitigate energy than it is with food, and I think there's an overwhelming case for a windfall tax on profits from those energy producers fed back to those most in need of help with energy prices. 'I think that would be the single biggest thing that could be done.' Allan said he had also seen Tesco customers asking checkout staff to stop scanning their items once their bill had reached a certain threshold.  'I was hearing for the first time for many years of customers saying to checkout staff, 'stop when you get to PS40' or something,' he said.  'They don't want to spend a penny over that, as opposed to having everything checked out. 'So I think a lot of people are feeling, you know, something of a pinch and lots of people are actually feeling extremely stretched.' Chancellor Rishi Sunak recently told a Mumsnet event that while he was concerned a windfall tax could also put off investment in new oil and gas extraction, 'nothing was ever off the table'. But other ministers -- including business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and policing minister Kit Malthouse -- have voiced their opposition to the move. Malthouse told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday: 'We have to be very careful about the talk of windfall taxes. 'Don't forget these are global companies who make their money all over the world and pay tax all over the world, and we don't want to deter investment. 'They do already pay premium tax, double what other companies pay. 'And what we've seen over the last year or so, certainly, since the Ukraine crisis, is that we need investment in our domestic energy production, so we want to help them and stimulate them to do that.' However, Allan said he believed energy companies were 'expecting' to be taxed and said he did not believe 'they would actually be much fazed by it'.  Allan also took aim at the government's decision to increase national insurance by 1.25 percentage points, saying it was 'hitting people on modest incomes disproportionately and it's absolutely the wrong time to do it'. 'If I were in government, I'd roll that back.'",
    "71d96677a270540f0eb93a46aed7a59255a623e5554e3d62edbf7cd2": "Remember during graduation you were given a scrolled up fake degree to pose with during those all-important pics? Well, for legally blind registered barrister Haleemah Farooq, who was due to take professional pictures when she was called to the Bar after smashing her exams, the pictures looked a bit different.  The lawyer, 25, from Slough, posed with the cane that helps her get around, instead of the piece of paper. And when she shared the image on Twitter, it quickly went viral. Farooq, currently working for the Kent Police and Crime Commissioner as a casework officer before she secures pupillage (like a training contract), expressed what the cane meant to her. She wrote: 'This picture speaks volumes to me as a British Pakistani, blind Muslim woman. When taking the professional pictures at my Call ceremony I ensured that my white cane was in the photo because it is significant to my journey as a legally blind barrister.'  Since the image went viral, amassing more than 25,000 likes on Twitter, Farooq has even personalised her cane, adding pink florals to the item.  She tells HuffPost: 'It's tradition to hold the little fake degree thing and I chose not to do that in my individual picture, instead I held my white cane (it's now pink! I got it personalised recently but it's technically still called a white cane). 'It meant a lot to me to hold my cane.' Farooq struggled with the cane at first, as someone who is partially sighted, and was reluctant to use it. But recently, she began using it full-time and it's revolutionised her life. 'I have always been a confident person but have only recently started to use my white cane full time,' she added. 'Blind people use their cane for two reasons, identification or mobility. Although I would use my cane here and there, I was never confident enough to use it maybe because I never saw others who looked liked me growing up, being a British Pakistani blind hijabi and I was very conscious of the looks I used to get. 'But I soon learned that my cane is my eyes, my friend, my aid and it helps me on so many levels. So I started using my cane full time and given that it's empowered me beyond belief I thought it only right to let it shine with me in my professional photos.' For Farooq, being a Pakistani woman who wears a hijab and is now on her way to becoming a licensed barrister (once she secures pupilage), the moment is big for her for various reasons. 'I haven't seen much representation from others like me, but I don't mind being the first. I just hope that I can inspire other parents who think a disabled child can't achieve things,' she says.  'Though, I don't think I was doing anything amazing, I just like documenting my life so I'm happy it touched others.'",
    "398ad33ce04c5e8928c3bf7913242a24d6617bfec450da3bd600b460": "Keir Starmer's promise to resign if he is fined over beergate does not mean that Boris Johnson also has to quit, a minister has said. After days of pressure and mounting questions, Starmer confirmed on Monday afternoon that he would step down as Labour leader if fined over a gathering he attended after campaigning in Durham last year.  The move has raised questions about whether Johnson -- who has already been fined by the Metropolitan Police -- would have to follow suit. But policing minister Kit Malthouse rejected suggestions that Starmer's decision would inevitably force Johnson's hand. Asked on LBC if the PM would have to resign if Starmer decided to quit, Malthouse said: 'Not necessarily, no. 'Obviously in any situation where, you know, the rules were moving around, there were misunderstandings or mistakes were made, and apologies are made and they are accepted, then people of all walks of life should be able to keep their jobs. 'But Keir Starmer has to speak for himself and set his own standards.' Malthouse later told the BBC's Today programme: 'As far as I'm concerned the rules were moving around, if mistakes were made, if apologies were made, I'm not sure that anybody be they so humble should lose their job over a fixed penalty notice. 'I don't know what Keir Starmer is attempting to do, whether he's attempting to turn what is obviously slightly a mysterious situation into a sort of political one, I don't know. 'In the end we have to leave space and time for Durham Police to do their job, which I know they'll do with professionalism and exactitude. And once they've reached their conclusion he can decide what he wants to do.' In his announcement, Starmer made it clear he believed 'no rules were broken' but promised to resign if Durham police chose to fine him for attending the gathering in April 2021. There have been mounting questions over the Labour leader's conduct after he was pictured drinking a beer after campaigning during last year's local elections.  It later came to light that a curry had also been ordered late at night and that up to 30 people may have been at the event, prompting Durham police to open an investigation.   At the time of the gathering, the ban on indoor mixing between households remained in place but there was an exemption for 'work purposes'.   Starmer has denied wrongdoing as he simply 'stopped for something to eat' during the working day. 'I am absolutely clear that no laws were broken,' he said. 'They were followed at all times. I simply had something to eat while working late in the evening as any politician would do days before an election. 'If the police decided to issue me with a fixed penalty notice I would course do the right thing and step down.'      ",

It's easier to get outside and go on walks, your skin looks better and you generally feel more alive. As our social lives slowly get back to normal, too, the sun is adding a big pep in our steps. But what is the science behind why it gives us that boost? What is it about the sunlight that makes our days feel more worthwhile? If you want to know why warm weather makes us so happy, keep reading. The sun is good for our mental health A lack of sun exposure has been linked to a drop in your serotonin levels, which can lead to depression during the winter time. The light-induced effects of serotonin are caused by sunlight that enters through the eye. This is why people often use light therapy treatments for seasonal depression. Sunshine is linked to better sleep Regularly exposure to sunlight promotes the production of melatonin which is the hormone that helps to regulate the body's sleep-wake cycle. This encourages the feeling of drowsiness, making us drift off easier at night while also making us happier in they day. Our circadian rhythm, the body's internal clock that signals when to be alert, is also regulated by melatonin, which can also make us happier.  The sun helps us build stronger bones Exposure to the ultraviolet-B radiation in the sun's rays causes our skin to create vitamin D, which plays a big role in building our bones.  A study found that in people wearing a swimsuit for 30 minute period, the following vitamin D levels were produced   50,000 international units (IUs) in most Caucasian people   20,000 to 30,000 IUs in tanned people   8,000 to 10,000 IUs in dark skinned people   Sunlight can help prevent cancer While it's important to use sun cream to protect your skin from harmful UV rays, a healthy amount of sunlight actually helps us avoid cancer. People who live in areas with a fewer daylight hours are more likely to have specific cancers than people who live in areas that have more sun during the day. These include colon cancer, Hodgkin's lymphona, ovarian, pancreatic and prostrate cancer.  The sun is good for our skin Have you noticed that your skin looks better in the sun? There's a reason for this. Exposure to the sun can help treat numerous skin conditions, according to the World Health Organistion (WHO), including psoriasis, eczema, jaundice and acne. Don't forget to wear SPF, of course, but it's good to know, huh? Happier skin, happier you.",
    "6eeea121ac2b0868a95d2ed7870ee7691f846d34ea53acc007dbf52e": "Prince Harry showed off his acting chops -- and his 'Girl Dad' T-shirt -- in a new video campaign for his nonprofit travel organisation Travalyst.  The nearly five-minute video promoting sustainable travel for New Zealanders lightheartedly offers the idea that holiday destinations rate travellers -- instead of the other way around.  In the YouTube video released on Monday, the Duke of Sussex stars alongside New Zealand actors Rhys Darby, Dave Fane and Rena Owen. At the start of the clip, the royal is seen running through the woods before he's stopped by a 'ratings agent' from New Zealand. Harry is questioned about a lollipop wrapper he allegedly dropped in 2018, when he and Meghan Markle were visiting the country on a royal tour.  The agent goes over a pretty personal rating system for the duke, praising him for using only one towel during a hotel stay and for not running water while he brushes his teeth. The revelations prompt a bewildered Harry to question the agent: 'How do you know that? That's really weird.' Later, after a second agent arrives and they discover a mix-up -- they were supposed to stop Harry Styles instead of the prince -- the royal's forearm is stamped with four stars.  In a statement shared with HuffPost, the duke talks about the 'opportunity and a need to redefine the industry -- for better, for good' as travel recovers amid the ongoing pandemic.  'We created the nonprofit Travalyst to rethink how travel can continue to expand our global understanding, to break down barriers, and to create cultural connections through experiences we otherwise wouldn't have,' Harry says in the statement.  'We do this while, at the same time, ensuring local communities truly feel benefit from tourism and safeguarding essential ecosystems. In a world where we're tasked with rating so many things, we're now asking: what if your destination rated you?'  The Duke of Sussex exclusively premiered the campaign on the Maori Television show 'Te Ao with Moana.'  Harry launched his initiative promoting sustainable travel in 2019, alongside partners Booking.com, Skyscanner, Trip.com Group, Tripadvisor and Visa. Google and Expedia recently joined the efforts, which aim to 'empower travellers to make better choices for themselves and the planet.'  The duke will soon be traveling himself. A spokesperson recently confirmed to HuffPost that Harry and Meghan will return to the UK for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations next month. The couple will be joined by their two children, Archie and Lili. Lili, who was born in June 2021, has yet to meet her great-grandmother in person.  The news of the Sussexes joining in the celebrations followed Buckingham Palace's announcement that the couple would not be included at the annual Trooping the Colour balcony appearance.  'After careful consideration, the Queen has decided that this year's traditional Trooping the Colour balcony appearance on Thursday 2nd of June will be limited to Her Majesty and those members of the Royal Family who are currently undertaking official public duties on behalf of the Queen,' the palace said in a statement shared with HuffPost on Friday. The announcement means that Prince Andrew, who also is not a working royal, won't join the royal family on the balcony, either. Andrew fell into disgrace from his association with the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

The presenter of the BBC podcast You, Me And The Big C said the last six months have been 'heartbreaking' to go through, but that she has been surrounded by 'so much love' and has 'no regrets'. Deborah was diagnosed with the condition in 2016 and since then has kept her nearly 300,000 Instagram followers up to date with her treatments, with candid posts about her progress and diagnosis. On December 14 2021, she marked five years since her diagnosis, writing on Instagram: 'I'm fully aware I shouldn't be alive to write this today.' But in a new post on Monday, she said: 'The message I never wanted to write. We have tried everything, but my body simply isn't playing ball. 'My active care has stopped and I am now moved to hospice at home care, with my incredible family all around me and the focus is on making sure I'm not in pain and spending time with them. 'Nobody knows how long I've got left but I'm not able to walk, I'm sleeping most of the days, and most things I took for granted are pipe dreams.' She added that she had left 'no stone unturned' in search of treatment, but that even a 'magic new breakthrough' would not make a difference. The former deputy headteacher announced in her post that she is setting up the Bowelbabe Fund, and shared links to charities including Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. She wrote: 'All I ask, if you ever read a column, followed my Instagram, listened to the podcast or saw me dressed as a poo for no reason, please buy me a drink to see me out this world, by donating the cost to @bowelbabefund which will enable us to raise funds for further lifesaving research into cancer. To give more Deborah's more time!'. She added: 'Right now for me it's all about taking it a day at a time, step by step and being grateful for another sunrise. 'My whole family are around me and we will dance through this together, sunbathing and laughing (I'll cry!!) at every possible moment! 'You are all incredible, thank you for playing your part in my journey. 'No regrets. Enjoy life x Deborah.' The fund name echoes her social media handle, Bowelbabe, and by early morning on May 10 it had reached nearly PS700,000. ",
    "d7bdf4ec0bcbc2f9d6927ef7f49245b6df70bc903d48d03382f34902": "We've all been there: upon walking into the office, an acquaintance cheerfully greets you by name and you pause, frantically searching your brain for theirs.  You don't want to disrespect them by saying the wrong name, but just saying 'hey' seems so generic. Do you come clean about your memory lapse? Here's how experts say you can address the conundrum strategically and still keep your relationships intact. You may consider a subtle approach first If you are at an event and you see someone you know but you can't remember their name, introduce yourself first, because it often prompts that person to say their name too. That's what Mary Abbajay, president of the leadership development consultancy Careerstone Group, recommends. 'That is a signal for you to say your name back,' Abbajay says. But don't think you are being sly about your strategy. Many people will recognise that it means you don't know their name, she says.  One other indirect approach is to discreetly ask someone else to tell you the other person's name, Abbajay adds. If you are in a conversation that will continue later, consider asking the person to put their contact information in your phone. Or if the conversation needs to move to email, try asking, 'Can you tell me how to spell your name to get the email right?' suggests Perpetua Neo, a psychologist and executive coach. Better yet, ask them directly and apologise.  Avoiding saying someone's name every time you see them will only get you so far. 'I think people fake it too long, and then they meet that person three or four times, and then they are too embarrassed to ask their name,' Abbajay says. 'The best thing is to nip that in the bud right away. The second time you meet them, say, 'Remind me of your name again. Thank you so much.'' Don't minimise your actions and say, 'Oh I do this all the time.' If this is your third or fourth time asking their name, that deserves a bigger mea culpa, Abbajay says. People's names are important to them, and you want your apology to come across as sincere.  Don't make it too big a deal, though, either.  'We feel an internal pressure to remember people's names after they tell us once, but that's not fair, and truly, most people understand that,' says Lawrese Brown, the founder of C-Track Training, a workplace education company. 'Even if it's a close colleague, some of us are better with names than others and some of us forget things easily in general.' 'The biggest mistake is to be overly apologetic like there is something wrong with you,' Neo says. 'Being gracious and pleasant about it can be useful.' Don't get discouraged if it happens more than once. Learning names takes time, Brown says, but what pushes her to ask for name reminders is to remember there are worse alternatives: You can make the wrong guess and call that person by an incorrect name, or you can be impersonal and never say their name. 'In the short term, asking may feel embarrassing, but that's a temporary feeling,' Brown says. 'The feeling of letting someone know that you care enough to call them by their name is what they'll remember.' Write down names whenever possible and try saying a person's name when you first meet them. Brown says that writing down someone's name is what works best for her as far as remembering them. Research has shown that writing things down helps our brains really retain what is being said. A 2014 study in Psychological Science, for example, found that students who wrote notes down on paper had better comprehension and retention of what was being taught than students typing on their laptops.  If you don't have access to a pen or paper, try using your voice. Here's a pro tip: Use someone's name within the first minutes of meeting someone. Abbajay says that in meetings she facilitates, she will ask people to introduce themselves even if some people already know each other as a way to help her remember names. When people introduce themselves, she diagrams where they are sitting and what their names are. That way, 'When I'm in the meeting, I can start using people's names. If you use somebody's name quickly when you meet them, chances are you are going to remember their name,' she says. ",

    "b1f2018aa22c4215fefb08d2c5ec1fed084037980722fe5a249c981a": "The state opening of parliament is the head of the British state's major constitutional duty, and a day of pageantry is marked by the monarch's speech in the upper chamber, the House of Lords. In the address, the Queen is tasked with setting out the government's plans for new laws in the next session of what is supposed to be a five-year parliament. On Tuesday, Buckingham Palace announced that the 96-year-old Queen would not attend and Prince Charles would assume her duties, including reading out the agenda-setting speech. What is the Queen's speech? The Queen's speech sets out the government's priorities for the coming session of parliament, outlining proposed policies and legislation. The address is delivered by the monarch during the state opening of parliament, a ceremonial event which marks the formal start of the parliamentary year. It is important to note that the Queen does not write the speech. The Queen remains politically neutral and above party politics so the speech is written by government minsters.  The speech is read out by the Queen in the House of Lords, and typically lasts just a few minutes. The event is perhaps best known around the world for its pomp and ceremony. The Queen travels to parliament in a state coach, escorted by mounted soldiers in ceremonial uniform. The imperial state crown and other regalia travel ahead in a carriage of their own. The monarch puts on the robe of state before leading a procession to the Lords, where she sits on a throne and formally opens the new session of parliament by reading out the speech. Why won't the Queen be there?  Buckingham Palace said on Monday that the Queen's son and heir, Prince Charles, will carry out the duty on behalf of the Queen. He will be accompanied by his eldest son, Prince William. It is the latest event the Queen will not attend because of her health. She has been forced to cut back on engagements since being hospitalised for a night last October for an unspecified illness, and then being told by her doctors to rest. Queen Elizabeth II, the world's eldest and longest-reigning monarch, has continued to carry out many of her duties virtually. Her first public event since falling ill was in April, when she attended a memorial service to her late husband, Prince Philip, who died last year. The monarch 'reluctantly' pulled out of the occasion as she continues to experience 'episodic mobility problems' with royal doctors advising her against attending, the Palace said. A new letters patent authorised by the Queen was issued to cover the state opening, delegating to counsellors of state the royal function of opening a new session of parliament. In this instance, it enables Charles and William to jointly exercise that function.  Prince Charles already takes the place of the Queen at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday, the annual event commemorating Britain's war dead. He has also supported her at the state opening of parliament since the retirement of Prince Philip in 2017.  Has she missed the ceremony before? It is the first time in nearly 60 years that the Queen will miss the state opening.  She was pregnant with Prince Andrew in 1959 the first time she missed the event took, and again just before Prince Edward's birth in 1963. On those occasions the Lord Chancellor read the speech on her behalf. What will be in the Queen's Speech? The government is expected to use the speech to bring forward changes to Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trading arrangements, alter laws the UK inherited from the European Union after Brexit, and replace the human rights act with a British bill of rights. A range of new education policies, a levelling up and regeneration bill and plans to privatise Channel 4 are also expected to be included. It is unclear whether more powers for a watchdog to regulate tech giants like Facebook and Google will be in the speech.",
    "28f966fcb3d9de0bd06b9d76122a400122de25ca9b4393a74dd97ddc": "Keir Starmer has pledged to resign should police fine him for breaking lockdown rules. The Labour leader is under investigation for a gathering in Durham in April 2021, where he was pictured drinking a beer. At the time, the ban on indoor mixing between households remained in place. But there was an exemption for 'work purposes'. Starmer has denied wrongdoing as he simply 'stopped for something to eat' during the working day. But if he does end up quitting, what happens next? To put it bluntly, Labour would need a new leader. Labour leadership rules If a Labour leader quits, a contest for their replacement is automatically triggered. Under party rules passed at Labour's last conference, candidates need the support of 20% of Labour MPs to get onto the ballot. There are 199 Labour MPs, which means candidates need 39 to nominate them. Starmer had initially proposed an even more radical change to the rules which included a 25% threshold of support from MPs. But he was forced to water down his proposals amid opposition from the left and the unions. Previously, including when Starmer was elected leader, candidates only needed 10% of MPs. Raising the threshold was seen as a move by Starmer's allies to lock leftwing MPs out of ever making it onto the ballot again in the wake of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. As well as winning the support of 20% of MPs, candidates need to be nominated by at least 5% of Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs) or at least three affiliates (two of which must be trade unions). Groups affiliated to Labour include the Labour Women's Network, LGBT Labour and BAME Labour. Unions include the GMB, Unison and Unite. For example, in the 2020 leadership contest, Starmer was nominated by the Usdaw and Unison unions and the affiliated environment campaign group Sera. Candidates who make it onto the ballot then go to a vote of party members, on a one member one vote basis. Under the rule changes agreed last year, members also now have to been signed up for six months to be allowed to vote in leadership contests. The 'registered supporters' scheme which allowed non-members to pay PS25 to vote in the 2020 contest has also been axed. In 2015, when Corbyn won the leadership, people could pay just PS3 to have a vote. The system was widely seen as handing Corbyn an advantage as non-members signed up in order to help him win the leadership. Who are the candidates?  Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, is probably seen as the frontrunner in any contest. Having run in 2020, she told The House magazine last year: 'I don't have any intention of ever putting myself through that again.' But on Sunday she refused to rule out throwing her hat into the ring if Starmer quit. Angela Rayner, the party's deputy leader, might also fancy a tilt at the leadership. She decided not to run in 2020 and instead run for deputy, she supported Starmer's leftwing rival Rebecca Long-Bailey in the leadership contest. But Rayner was also present at the Durham event and if she is fined for breaking the rules she has, like Starmer, pledged to quit, which would probably rule her out. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, is also a likely candidate. The 39-year-old has had a rapid rise under Starmer and is widely expected to run for leader one day. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, ran for the leadership in 2015. She served in Gordon Brown's cabinet as work and pensions secretary. In opposition she chaired the home affairs committee before returning to the frontbench under Starmer in November last year. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, is also a potential candidate. He has been the MP for Tottenham since 2000 and held several ministerial jobs during the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments.  Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, is talked of as a future leader. The 38-year-old has been MP for Houghton and Sunderland South since 2010 and her election as leader would mark a new generation. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester, has made no secret of his desire to be party leader one day. After losing to Corbyn in the 2015 contest, Burnham quit parliament to run for mayor. While he is popular in the party he is unlikely to be able to mount a challenge as candidates have to be MPs. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, is also seen as keen to run for the leadership. But, like Burnham, is currently not an MP and barring a very convenient by-election in which he could stand, would be ineligible.",

The Queen will not attend the ceremony on Tuesday, Buckingham Palace confirmed, which sets out the government's policies and proposed legislation for the new session. The monarch 'reluctantly' pulled out of the occasion as she continues to experience 'episodic mobility problems' with royal doctors advising her against attending. The announcement marks a significant move towards the handing over of sovereign duties to Prince Charles.  The 96-year-old monarch has missed the ceremony only twice during her 70 years on the throne. The Palace said in a statement: 'The Queen continues to experience episodic mobility problems, and in consultation with her doctors has reluctantly decided that she will not attend the State Opening of Parliament tomorrow. 'At Her Majesty's request, and with the agreement of the relevant authorities, The Prince of Wales will read The Queen's Speech on Her Majesty's behalf, with The Duke of Cambridge also in attendance.' The first time she missed the event took place when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew in 1959 and just before Prince Edward's birth in 1963. On those occasions the Lord Chancellor read the speech on her behalf.  Prior to the event, Buckingham Palace drew up contingency plans for Prince Charles to read the speech amid concerns Her Majesty would be unable to attend. The palace had said she was aiming to deliver the speech but her attendance would only be confirmed on the day. For the past two state openings the Queen opted to travel to the Palace of Westminster by car, rather than carriage. In recent months the Queen has missed a number of engagements because of mobility problems, including the royal garden party season. Prince Charles already takes the place of the Queen at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday. He has also supported her at the State Opening of Parliament since the retirement of the Duke of Edinburgh in 2017. Many of the events involve standing for long periods which the Queen is no longer able to do.  It has raised questions about which events she will be able to attend as part of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations next month. ",
    "1141529a2a447e9f98a6665d90486929098cd54dda1d895daf09feb9": "Singer-songwriter Nick Cave has announced that his son Jethro Lazenby has died at the age of 31. In a statement issued to HuffPost UK on Monday afternoon, the Australian star said: 'With much sadness, I can confirm that my son, Jethro, has passed away. We would be grateful for family privacy at this time.' Jethro - a former actor, model and photographer, who sometimes used the moniker Jethro Cave - was born in Australia in 1991. He previously revealed that he did not meet his musician father until he was 'about seven'. Earlier this year, he was arrested and taken into police custody after a physical assault on his mother, Beau Lazenby, in Melbourne, Australia. His legal representative, Sean Ghattas, said Jethro had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which had affected his judgement. According to Metro, Jethro had been released from custody two days before his death, on the condition he undergo substance abuse treatment and not contact his mother for the next two years. The outlet also reported he was due to appear in court next month to receive sentencing for the assault. Jethro was previously sentenced to prison time in 2018 after assaulting his girlfriend. Nick lost another son, Arthur, in 2015 after he fell to his death from a cliff in Brighton when he was 15 years old. Last year, the singer revealed that he and his wife, model Susie Bick, had relocated to Los Angeles, stating that it had become 'too sad' for them to stay in Brighton. Speaking to The Guardian in 2017, Nick said of the grieving process: 'It's hard to know what to say that is helpful. People often say they can't imagine how it would feel to lose a child, but, actually, they can - they can imagine what it is like. 'A lot is said about grief, especially the conventional wisdom that you do it alone. I personally have found that not to be the case. The goodwill we received after Arthur's death from people who I did not know, especially through social media, people who liked my music and kind of reached out, was extraordinary.'",
    "90529c25c4e2d07b16d2c2309f4921bffe7828a07a29bfb19b7deda3": "Sinn Fein just won the most seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time in the devolved government's history - here's what it could mean for the country's future. What you need to know about Sinn Fein Sinn Fein's primary goal is to achieve a united Ireland. This would mean taking Northern Ireland out of the UK and making it one country again with the Republic of Ireland, a century after the island was first split into two. The party even refuses to use the term Northern Ireland, instead calling the country 'the North'. Once linked with the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Troubles - which gradually came to an end after the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 - Sinn Fein is often considered a divisive party because of its complicated history. Now, it strongly advocates for peace across Ireland, and many of its supporters are of a younger generation who do not remember the conflict of the Troubles. Why is the party's win significant? This is a seismic shift for Northern Irish politics because for the first 50 years of the country's existence, it was ruled exclusive by unionists. And ever since the Good Friday Agreement, the country has been led by a unionist politician. Why have they suddenly received so much more support? Although it is what Sinn Fein is most known for, the United Ireland argument was not centre stage throughout the party's election campaign. Instead, it was the cost of living crisis and a promise to help the general public. To counter their opponents, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) simply warned that a vote for Sinn Fein would lead to another referendum on Irish unity - even though that was barely in the party's manifesto. And it seems Irish unification is not a pressing matter right now for voters. A poll from the University of Liverpool's Institute of Irish Studies found that only 30% of Irish voters would vote for unity 'tomorrow'. Others have argued that it comes down to the DUP's disintegration over recent years, as the party has been split following the Brexit vote and the subsequent Northern Ireland Protocol, disliked by most unionists for separating the country from the rest of the UK. Sinn Fein did actually secure the same number of seats in 2022 and as they did in 2017. It's the DUP who have seen a decrease in support, having held onto 28 seats in 2017, before dropping to 25 this year. DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly even admitted: 'What we've seen is a fracturing of unionism - there hasn't been a dramatic change in the size of the vote.' What does all this mean for the Northern Ireland Assembly? The party ousted their unionist opponents, winning a total of 27 seats in the Assembly compared to the DUP's 25 in the election, making them the first nationalist party to have a majority in Stormont. However, Sinn Fein's victory does not mean that the party can already start governing independently - the power-sharing system in place in Northern Ireland means Sinn Fein has to govern with the DUP. Sinn Fein's vice-president Michelle O'Neill, who leads the party in Northern Ireland, can now take on the first minister role for the country but she cannot assume the position until the DUP appoint a deputy, who will actually be equal to her in status. They cannot hold office without the other, and the DUP is currently refusing to take its place in the Northern Ireland Assembly. What's the hold-up? The DUP says it will not nominate any ministers to Stormont until Westminster acts on the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is a fundamental part of the current Brexit arrangements, and was championed by Boris Johnson within his first months in office. It means Northern Ireland has to follow the trade rules of the EU, despite leaving the bloc along with the rest of the UK. It is still part of the UK but there are now checks on goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland. The protocol was meant to prevent Northern Ireland putting up a hard border with the Republic of Ireland - a problem which contributed to the past tensions in Ireland - as long as the north continued to follow EU regulations like its southern neighbour. However, Northern Ireland unionists think this setup undermines its position with the rest of the union, and claim that this is an 'existential threat' to the country's place in the UK. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the DUP, even withdrew Paul Givan as the first minister of Northern Ireland in February to protest the protocol. DUP MP Gavin Robinson said his party wants a functioning government but needs to prioritise the 'infectious nature of the protocol and the damage that it's doing'. It means the government is currently in a stalemate if the DUP does not nominate a deputy first minister. For now, the assembly goes on in a caretaker capacity and the ministers who were in their roles prior to the election stay on - the executive is made up of the first and deputy first ministers, along with eight others. This will go on for up to six months. After that, a new election could be called or the Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis will come up with an alternative. Does this mean there could be a united Ireland on the horizon? In short - no, not necessarily. The party has not proposed a border poll just yet, but said it is working towards a unity referendum within a 'five-year framework'. It's more likely this would be a key component of its future campaigns - to put forward a referendum in the years to come. It would also need Westminster government to approve it, which seems unlikely as Downing Street is keen to squash the separatist sentiment in Scotland right now. A border poll would also be necessary in the Republic of Ireland, where Sinn Fein is winning more votes than other parties too. The Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin said he was 'amused' by such a suggestion that a united Ireland could be on the cards. He told RTE's Morning Ireland: 'That was not the mandate sought by Sinn Fein in the last three weeks. 'The whole campaign was on cost of living, on health and on housing. 'The border poll was nearly buried from its documentation and its manifesto and, (as) soon as the votes are counted, it is brought back into centre stage.' Martin added: 'This was an election fought on current topical issues and, therefore, I think parties could lose out if they do not respond to what people said to them on the doorsteps.'",
    "d669eb71c617ec97f6426923d8d568ebdcce7d6bb9ed7952f820521f": "A Labour MP has spoken out about maternal loneliness and the mental health issues she suffered after giving birth to her first son.  Ellie Reeves said the birth was one of the 'best days of my life' but confessed that she struggled afterwards with feeling 'lonely and isolated'. The shadow justice minister argued society should be more willing to talk about the impact of childbirth and 'remove the stigma' of mental health.  Her eldest son was almost two-and-a-half years old when she was first elected to parliament in 2017. Reeves and her husband, fellow Labour MP John Cryer, welcomed their second son in the middle of the 2019 election campaign.  However, the former lawyer said she found her first pregnancy particularly 'hard and challenging' and that when he was born he did not sleep much and had feeding issues. In an interview with Gloria De Piero on GB News, she said: 'It was really, really hard and quite exhausting. And people don't talk about that side of things so much, but I think it's important to say that it isn't always easy.' When she went back to work, Reeves ended up creating a legal consultancy providing affordable advice to women facing maternity discrimination. However, she said the reality of working from home without colleagues was hard, adding: 'That's when I started to feel really quite lonely and isolated. Because I didn't have that routine of sort of going into work and interacting with people.' Asked if she was depressed, she replied: 'I don't know if I'd have met a clinical diagnosis for depression, I certainly didn't ask for help. But I certainly felt very lonely and isolated, and that had an impact on my mental health. I think the more isolated I became, the less I then started to go out and interact with other people. 'You sort of lose your confidence don't you, if you stop going out, you start to lose confidence in yourself and your ability to do all of that. And on the face of it, I had the successful business, nice home, beautiful baby boy. And it's really hard isn't it to say 'actually, I am struggling a little bit here'.' The MP for Lewisham West and Penge has previously spoken in parliament about suffering with prenatal depression which led to an exacerbation of anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. Asked about it, she replied: 'I felt very anxious about going out. I got very worried if I went out, what if something happened to me?  'I got really, really anxious and then it was sort of easier to spend most of my time at home and to withdraw a little bit. 'And then you get into that cycle of then not going out and then not interacting with people and withdrawing really, and I did that for quite a while.' She said society could help those feeling low by being more 'honest and open' about it. 'I think that as a society we need to be more willing to talk about these issues and actually to remove the stigma around mental health,' she said. 'With things like having a baby, it's such a massive change that it's probably quite normal for people to have some sort of mental health issues during that time. 'And rather than being like 'oh no we can't talk about it' actually we should be open and honest about it. 'And also, we need to make sure that the help is then there when people do ask for it. And, you know, I feel quite keenly that there needs to be adequate mental health provisions so that when people do ask for help, they get it.' Reeves said she did not think it would be difficult to ensure that all new mums received help and support that would make a 'huge difference'.",
    "996a108f38d30643ead540cd7ea67a283899ed9a0dd63325a7a3fcaa": "Some hay fever medicines are in short supply across the UK, which sounds like a nightmare scenario for those of us prone to itchy eyes, scratchy throats and headaches this time of year. But don't panic, there are other medications available. You might just struggle to get your hands on meds containing a key ingredient.  Stocks of chlorphenamine maleate, the active ingredient in brands such as Piriton, have been affected, although other hay fever medicines are available. A spokesperson for the pharmacy chain Boots said only four out of 90 hay fever products were affected and there was good availability of other hay fever items. 'There are a very small number of lines that are currently out of stock due to a current, industry-wide shortage of the active ingredient chlorphenamine maleate,' they said. 'However, we are expecting this to be resolved soon and new deliveries are expected in the coming weeks.' What alternative hay fever meds are available?  Other hay fever medicines such as Piriteze use cetirizine hydrochloride and are still in plentiful supply. Royal Pharmaceutical Society president Claire Anderson said: 'Chlorphenamine maleate is just one component of a few hay fever tablets, including Piriton, which is not a first line choice for treating hay fever for adults as it is more likely to make patients drowsy. 'Other medication using cetirizine hydrochloride or loratadine is still available widely in pharmacies across the country, and fexofenadine is also now available on general sale at pharmacies this year for the first time, so patients actually have more options than ever to treat their hay fever symptoms.' Why is there a shortage of chlorphenamine maleate? 'Medicines shortages are not a new problem, and is something pharmacists and pharmacy teams have to manage and deal with on a daily basis, and have done for a long time,' Anderson explained.  'This can be for a multitude of reasons, including manufacturing issues, global demand or disruption with the supply chain. Availability of certain medicines fluctuates, and it is important to ask your pharmacist for alternatives.' You might have also read news that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is currently being hit by supply shortages across the UK. While HRT is usually prescribed by a doctor, many hay fever medications are available over the counter.  'GPs, pharmacists and patient groups have called for pharmacists to be able to make minor changes to a prescription when something is out of stock - this should be considered as part of a package of measures to address future medicines supplies,' Anderson added.  What should you do if you can't access your usual medication?  If your go-to hay fever medication is out of stock, speak to your pharmacist about which alternatives may be suitable for you. The NHS also recommends the following tips for reducing the impact of hay fever symptoms:   Put Vaseline around your nostrils to trap pollen   Wear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into your eyes   Shower and change your clothes after you have been outside to wash pollen off   Stay indoors whenever possible   Keep windows and doors shut as much as possible   Vacuum regularly and dust with a damp cloth   Buy a pollen filter for the air vents in your car and a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter   Try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities.

Police in Durham announced last week that they will re-investigate claims that he broke covid lockdown laws in April, 2021, by having curry and beer with colleagues. Starmer has repeatedly insisted that no rules were broken because the meal took place during a work meeting, and that he and his staff went back to work again afterwards The Labour leader pulled out of a planned speech and question-and-answer session, which he had been due to make on Monday. According to The Times, Starmer is being encouraged by close colleagues to announce that should be be found to have broken covid rules by Durham Constabulary, he will resign. It is hoped that would heap pressure on Boris Johnson, who Starmer has called on to quit after he was issued with a fixed penalty notice for attending a birthday party in the Cabinet Office in June, 2020. One senior Labour source told HuffPost UK: 'He is more likely to go down that route than not. 'I suspect there has been quite a lot of discussion about it and ultimately his instinct is that his integrity is more important to him than anything else. 'The fundamental position is we don't think he has breached the rules and we're very confident about that. 'But in the end, he's been clear what the threshold for resigning is when it comes to the prime minister.' One supporter told The Times: 'There's a clear logic to it. It would give him something to say at the despatch box when Johnson raises it.' Earlier this morning, shadow health secretary Wes Streeting dismissed suggestions that Starmer will have to quit. He said: 'I just don't think that's going to happen, I'm not going to entertain that prospect.' On Sunday night, cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said he did not believe Starmer should have to resign even if he is fined. Many Tories fear that the prime minister will come under renewed pressure to quit if the Labour leader falls on his own sword. David Simmonds MP told other members of the Tories' 2019 intake in a WhatsApp group: 'The only 'good' outcome I can see is if Starmer is fined and doesn't resign. Any other outcome just makes us look worse by comparison.'",

But many Conservatives have accused Starmer of hypocrisy given his previous attacks on Boris Johnson for rule breaking. Speaking at a press conference on Monday afternoon, Starmer said: 'If the police decide to issue me with a fixed penalty notice (FPN) I would of course do the right thing and step down.' The Labour leader said the idea he would 'casually break' Covid restrictions was 'wrong'. Labour hope the pledge will heap pressure on the prime minister, who Starmer has called on to quit after he was issued with a fixed penalty notice for attending a birthday party in the Cabinet Office in June, 2020.

The company said it usually separates its games content from its news content, but that Monday's Wordle answer (which, spoiler warning, appears below) broke that rule, and matched the week's news cycle a little too closely. 'Wordle continues to delight millions of people every day, but as we move it over to The Times's technology, we have continued to discover challenges,' wrote Everdeen Mason, the company's editorial director for Games. 'Today, for example, some users may see an outdated answer that seems closely connected to a major recent news event.' The event in question is last week's Politico scoop -- a leaked majority draft opinion showing the Supreme Court is preparing to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, stripping Americans off their constitutional right to access abortion. The word 'fetus' was selected and inserted into the system last year, well before the publication of the Supreme Court draft, which has turbocharged the national conversation around abortion. 'At New York Times Games, we take our role seriously as a place to entertain and escape, and we want Wordle to remain distinct from the news,' Mason wrote. Mason said the Times took action to change the word for as many users as possible last week, but those who hadn't refreshed their browser window since would still get the 'outdated' answer. The company bought the viral puzzle game, which gives users six attempts to guess a five-character word, from software engineer Josh Wardle in January. Over the weekend, activists gathered outside the homes of two conservative Supreme Court justices, Brett Kavanaugh and John Roberts, to protest the projected outcome of Roe being overturned. On Sunday, a fire broke out at the Wisconsin Family Action office, an anti-abortion facility in Madison, with the unknown vandals leaving a spray-painted message outside the building: 'If abortions aren't safe, then you aren't either.' Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers insisted Roe was unconstitutional and said they felt for pregnant women in a challenging situation.

    "f170345893e48ffa7c24748f2a378b4cfc7755baa3d5922a3159a5fb": "The Duchess of Cambridge, as you might have heard, is on the look-out for a new personal assistant to her Private Secretary. Kensington Palace said it is on the hunt for someone to support the Duchess of Cambridge in her official and charity work, providing a range of admin and operational support including organising travel, managing their diary, monitoring emails and taking minutes. The new person also needs to be a big fan of the Duchess's work.  The Palace is looking for someone with experience too, with the successful candidate showing previous secretarial and administrative responsibility, excellent IT skills and interpersonal skills and being good at organisation. And all that for...PS27,500. That might sound about right to some people, given how poorly Brits are paid in this country, but actually, it's below average.  And let's not forget, the work is for one of the richest and most powerful families in the world. So, PS27k doesn't actually sound like a lot. And Twitter is pointing it out.  How much is the average salary then, we hear you ask? Well, it's a little bit complicated at the moment due to Covid, as the pandemic made it somewhat difficult to collect data from businesses.  But according to the latest earnings analysis (2021) from the ONS, the average salary for full-time workers was PS31,285 (you might see figures floating around online between PS24-25k but these may be based on part-time salaries, after tax figures, and from bodies which collate their data differently - HMRC has different data, for example). You also have to consider how the average salary is impacted by region. London, for example, has higher earnings than other parts of the country. Don't forget that high-earning CEOs, executives and figures on six-figure salaries boost up the average. While it can vary from industry to industry, depending on level of seniority and experience, the median London earning according to some research is around PS39,716 (though some sources cite as high a salary as PS53,000). Some of the most common pay ranges in the capital are between PS32,000-PS36,000 and PS36,000 to PS39,000.  The cost of living is also higher here too, therefore the London living wage is applied to some roles. So given some of the high figures here, a pay of PS27k for a role that's sure to be stressful, potentially dangerous, and outside a traditional 9-5, seems rather low. And yes, the problem isn't exclusive to the Royal family and workers around the country are earning lower than the pay advertised by the Palace - but what does that say about our culture of work in the UK, when so many people are underpaid? Many of our European counterparts are excelling in this realm, paying their workers a decent wage while also ensuring excellent healthcare and education systems. We should rise to these standards as opposed to accepting menial pay for poor conditions.  Let's also not forget the squeeze that cost of living is having many of us.

    "3de73f610b1bec53780944860672a634e6f1199539ba92775ed06ba0": "Russia's ambassador to Poland was surrounded by a large crowd who threw fake blood at him while chanting 'fascists' and 'murderers' on Monday. Sergey Andreev was in Warsaw to pay respects to the Soviet soldiers who died during World War 2. His arrival coincided with the national holiday known as Victory Day, where Russians still celebrate defeating Nazi Germany to this day. Hundreds of protesters, furious at Russia's barbaric treatment of Ukraine, stood in Andreev's way of the memorial and snatched away the wreath of flowers he wanted to place at the cemetery, where more than 20,000 Red Army soldiers are buried. The activists trampled on the flowers, before dousing him in red paint from behind and beside him - some of his entourage were hit by the red liquid too. Some activists carried Ukrainian flags as they surrounded the ambassador, while others donned white sheets also smeared with red liquid. The demonstration clearly meant to symbolise the thousands who have died since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.  Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova hit out against the attack, declaring: 'Admirers of the neo-Nazis have once again shown their face.' She suggested that this assault reflected the 'course for the reincarnation of fascism', as did the removal of Soviet statues from around Europe which has occurred in the weeks since Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Zakharova promised on her messaging app channel that 'we won't be scared' but that the 'people of Europe should be scared to see their reflection in a mirror'. The Polish government has subsequently been criticised for not providing more security for the ambassador amid fears that the Kremlin might eject the Polish ambassador from Russia in return, while others saw Andreev's appearance in Warsaw as a provocation. Demonstrations in Warsaw have been building since the war broke out - on Sunday evening, activists parked outside the city's Russian Embassy with a tank carried by a tractor. This seemingly bizarre image has become a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance, as Ukrainian farmers have been pictured hauling off Russian tanks ever since war broke out. Andreev's decision to make such a gesture on Victory Day adds to the growing tensions between Europe and Russia.  Russian president Vladimir Putin furiously blamed the West for Russia's attacks on Ukraine during his Victory Day speech, by suggesting Western allies were looking to invade 'our land'. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also denounced Poland's politicians last week for being 'openly hostile' towards Russia. He even claimed that Poland 'may pose a threat to the territorial integrity of Ukraine'.",

Even though the highly transmissible Omicron variant that swept across the world towards the end of 2021 continues to be the dominant strain, there are people who have not tested positive throughout the whole pandemic. Scientists are now looking to study this small demographic to see if their genes might help future treatment - or even prevent Covid infection altogether. Andras Spaan, a clinical microbiologist from the Rockefeller University in New York, is leading the hunt into what might cause this Covid resistance, with a particularly focus on their genetic material. He told the Washington Post: 'What we are looking for is potentially very rare genetics variants with a very big impact on the individual.' He is leading the international study, which already has 700 participants. Scientists are also screening more than 5,000 additional people who believe they could be immune to the virus. Health workers, who went without face masks during the height of the pandemic and still managed to test negative for Covid on a weekly basis, are among those who are being examined for signs of immunity. So how many people still haven't caught Covid? Journalist John Burn-Murdoch released a graph for the Financial Times last week explaining that - based on data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) - nine out of 10 people in England have tested positive for Covid at some point in the pandemic. Positive cases are falling at the moment, but the number of infections has fluctuated throughout the pandemic, according to which variant is spreading around and how up-to-date the general population is with its vaccination. Still, even as some people have reported catching Covid multiple times, there is still a category who believe they have not caught the virus at all. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention believes that six in 10 people across the States have had Covid at some point, at least once. According to data website Staista.com, there have been almost 514 million Covid cases as of May 1, 2022 - which certainly makes the people who have avoided it an anomaly. What could make some people Covid immune? Experts speculate that some people just might have fewer receptors in their noses, throats and lungs meaning the virus finds it harder to bind to their bodies. Alternatively, this minority could have previously been exposed to a similar virus which gave their immune systems a leg-up against Covid. They may have also been born with a particular immune system already equipped to fight the virus, making it a genetic issue. If scientists are able to find out why this small category of people have not been infected, both public health advice and Covid drugs could be significantly improved. It might even help protect the general population against future strains of the virus, which are expected. However, individual use of masks, vaccines, and social distancing might affect the study's ability to find those who are immune. Frequent testers, those who wear masks indoors and avoid high-risk gatherings or travel obviously decreased their risk of catching the virus through their decisions. This means it was not so much to do with their genetics or immune system, but their approach to the pandemic. Bob Wachter, professor and chair of the department of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, also told the Washington Post: 'It's got to be a combination of caution, circumstance and luck.'",
    "2f5f7f06f3bcf7dee7851902f453e9e77ddc8675590f29dd4546c7ca": "Keir Starmer made a lot of political capital out of revelations that Boris Johnson broke lockdown rules, with Labour enjoying a consistent poll lead over the Conservatives thanks to the partygate affair. The Labour leader heaped scorn on the prime minister and has demanded he resign after being fined by police. But now Starmer is under intense pressure himself after police announced they had launched an investigation into whether he also broke the law.  Durham Constabulary previously said they believed no offence was committed. But the case has now been reopened following repeated calls from the Conservative Party.  The row, dubbed 'Beergate', has overshadowed Labour's gains in last week's local elections and could yet lead to Starmer having to resign. What is the accusation? Starmer is accused of breaking lockdown rules on April 30, 2021, by eating a curry and drinking beer indoors with Labour staff in the constituency office of City of Durham MP Mary Foy. He was in the city campaigning in the run up to last year's local elections which took place on May 6. At the time, the ban on indoor mixing between households remained in place. But there was an exemption for 'work purposes'.  Starmer's critics have seized on a report in the Mail on Sunday as proof the gathering was an illegal social gathering rather than work. The paper published an internal Labour op-note which showed an hour and 20 minutes had been set aside for 'dinner' at Durham Miners Hall, after which the visit was due to end. Op-notes are memos used to set out the timings and location of events and are part of day-to-day political logistics.   Separately, the Sunday Times quoted an eyewitness present at the event who insisted no work was done after the meal.    What is the defence? Starmer has strongly denied he broke the law as he simply 'stopped for something to eat' and then continued to work. His allies have argued the Mail on Sunday memo actually proves the meal was included as part of Starmer's working day.  And while the op-note does suggest the leader's day ended after he had finished eating, it does not mean no further work was actually done. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, said as a former director of public prosecutions, Starmer would not have broken the law. 'He is Mr Rules, he does not not break the rules,' she told Sky News. 'It was not illegal to eat.' Wes Streeting, the shadow education secretary, also dismissed the allegations. 'Breaking news: Keir Starmer has dinner,' he said. What happens next? Starmer being under investigation by the police has effectively neutered his ability to attack the prime minister for breaking the rules. Johnson could very well be fined again in the coming weeks for taking part in Downing Street parties. But it will be hard for Starmer to make any political capital out of it. If Starmer is cleared, he will be able to return to making the case that while he followed the rules the PM did not, even if the waters have been muddied somewhat. But if he is fined, the pressure on him to resign will be huge given he has called on Johnson to do the same. It is also possible Durham police conclude Starmer did break the rules but do not issued him with a fixed penalty notice (FPN), as the force has previously said it has a policy of not issuing 'retrospective' fines. This was the case when it investigated Dominic Cummings' infamous trip to Barnard Castle. What do voters think? According to a YouGov poll released on Monday, almost half, 46 per cent, of British voters think Starmer should resign if he is fined by the police, compared to 32 per cent who think he should not. But the proportion of Labour voters who think he should quit in that situation, 48 per cent, is actually lower than the proportion of Tory voters, 40 per cent. This is compared to the 57 per cent of voters who believe Johnson should resign for his rule-breaking. But while Conservative voters are more forgiving of Starmer than Labour voters, only 29 per cent of Tories think the PM should have quit. In the court of public opinion, will voters really forgive the Labour leader if he does not practice what he has preached? That is the dilemma that Starmer and his team are currently wrestling with as they decide what to do next.",

Lee and Jenny have become one of the hit Channel 4 show's most popular pairings, offering their critiques on the week's telly from the sofa in Lee's caravan since 2014. However, some viewers were disappointed last week to discover the duo were absent from the latest episode of the current series. Speaking to the Daily Star at the TV Baftas, he revealed his friend has been 'not very well' in recent times, saying: 'She is having an operation, a mini one. But she is recovering well, though.' Lee added that Jenny had been invited to join him at the TV Baftas, but couldn't make it as the awards show clashed with her hospital appointment. 'You can't turn down an NHS operation down, can you?' he added. 'But she is doing well.' During Sunday night's ceremony, Gogglebox was nominated for Best Reality And Constructed Factual, which it won for the second time, beating Married At First Sight UK, RuPaul's Drag Race UK and Channel 4's The Dog House. Lee was among those to take to the stage to accept the award, alongside Gogglebox's creators and producers. Other winners on the night included Motherland, Ant And Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and Coronation Street, while there was outcry from some viewers when It's A Sin failed to pick up a single award despite seven nominations. Meanwhile, Rose Ayling-Ellis and Giovanni Pernice's 'silent' routine during last year's Strictly Come Dancing was named the Must-See TV Moment of the year, which is the only category voted for by the public.",

But instead of celebrating the star's news, some viewers of the reality show expressed confusion and even concern about the budding romance - and the reactions speak volumes about the scrutiny queer relationships still face.  During the show's reunion episode, Chrishell revealed that she's dating Australian singer G Flip.  'You don't get to choose where you meet someone. You don't get to choose when you meet someone in their life,' the real estate agent said. 'So recently, I've met someone that is in a different place in their life as well. I recently have been spending a lot of time with someone that's very important to me. Their name is G Flip. 'They're non-binary, so they go by they/them [pronouns], and they are an extremely talented musician.' Cue a lot of people questioning whether or not Chrishell still wants kids.  If you're a fan of the show, you'll remember Chrishell and her boss/boyfriend Jason Oppenheim broke up because he decided he didn't want children. But - and we can't believe this actually needs pointing out - there's nothing to say Chrishell, 40, can't still have kids in the future, either on her own or with 27-year-old G Flip, if that's what they wanted.   'I'm open to adoption, things like that,' Chrishell confirmed.  It seems the general public still needs some education about the many ways you can create a family in 2022.  The word 'rebound' has also been thrown about a lot in relation to their coupling up, alongside comments such as Chrishell 'needs to be single for a while' and remarks that she 'needs therapy'.  Would the reaction have been judgement-free if she'd announced a fling with a cisgender man? It's hard to say. But it wouldn't have been this queerphobic.  Sexuality aside for a moment, the idea that she's moved on 'too quickly' still smacks of slut-shaming. Even if this is a rebound, is a rebound so bad if all parties are enjoying some low-commitment fun? Clearly, Selling Sunset's fanbase need a tutorial or two on sex positivity. And we're hoping G Flip makes an appearance in the next series to deliver. ",
    "819ece12b2d9a0a398eb380ec7f2e5d89027b599977dc31e0a578f98": "Priti Patel's speech at a Conservative Party 'spring dinner' was interrupted by demonstrators calling the home secretary out for her treatment of refugees on Friday. Eight climate campaigners from the group Green New Deal Rising called for Patel to drop the home office's divisive plans to send asylum seekers who arrive to the UK via so-called 'illegal means' off to Rwanda. One after another, the activists stood up and criticised the home secretary - before being escorted out by security.  'Priti Patel, your racist policies are killing people,' the first demonstrator began, just as the home secretary started her speech. Those attending the Bassetlaw Conservative Association Spring Dinner began to boo the activists, and shout, 'out out out' - but the demonstrators continued unperturbed.  'Your plans to send seeking asylum to Rwanda, are inhumane and are going to ruin people's lives,' the protester said before being carried out by plain-clothed guards. Another person immediately stood up and said: 'Priti Patel, as a young person who wants to live in a fair and compassionate society, we are disgusted by your treatment of refugees in the UK.' The protesters continued to jump up from various places around the room, each picking up from where the last person finished. The next person cried: 'At every opportunity, we will stand against your cruel plans and stand with migrants, refugees and people seeking asylum. ' 'We want to live in a just and fair society that cares and respects people, wherever they come from,' an activist standing on a chair shouted over the rebuttals from the other attendees. 'We want to be open and welcoming and tackle these crises in a just a way.' Another person said: 'Priti Patel, we demand you drop your racist and problematic Rwanda migration policy. We demand that you treat people of this world fairly, and you treat them with respect. 'Whether you're from Rwanda, wherever you're from, you deserve to be treated with respect!' The protester continued shouting even as he was dragged out of the venue. A chorus then began among the remaining activists: ''Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here.' The one-minute video, shared on social media by the social justice group, then stops as all the demonstrators are pushed outside of the room. Writing for The Guardian on Monday, Green New Deal Rising organiser Holly Hudson explained that the climate activists confronted the home secretary because housing refugees amid soaring global temperatures are connected. 'Many of the crises in the global south are the direct result of centuries of colonial exploitation by wealthy countries such as the UK. We believe it is the responsibility of our government to provide safety for people facing these situations. The 'Rwanda plan' and the nationality and borders bill must continue to be challenged and scrutinised in parliament and in public.' The activist added: 'No matter what the repercussions, history shows that if enough of us stand up and say, 'No more', we can make a difference.' The group is known for targeting politicians to put pressure on the establishment related to the climate crisis and to pressing social issues. Patel's offshoring plan was announced in April, and is already facing legal challenges, as the government has openly admitted. Downing Street has since confessed that it might take several months before anyone is even sent to Rwanda, although it maintains: 'Our new Migration and Economic Development Partnership with Rwanda fully complies with international and national law.'",

The former Strictly champion, who announced in March that he was quitting the BBC dance show, has been taking acting lessons and auditioning for roles in an attempt 'to get his foot in the door' of Hollywood. The Slovenian dancer had been on Strictly for nine years, and news of his exit came less than a year after his wife, fellow dancer Janette Manrara, stepped down from the show to become the co-host of spin-off It Takes Two. Aljaz told Hello magazine: 'Being a couple on Strictly gave us an edge and I feel like it can be exactly the same when it comes to, potentially, one day being on a different kind of TV programme together.   'I've had an incredible nine years on Strictly and have felt so lucky to be there, but it felt like the right time to take a risk and open myself up to new challenges. 'I want to try other things like film, TV and radio while I'm still young enough and my body is 100% capable. 'I'm just a fan of the craft and am trying to get my foot in the door. 'Do I want to go to Hollywood? Of course! If I didn't dream big I would never have ended up on Strictly.'   Janette added: 'I already imagine him as a Hollywood leading man, he definitely has what it takes and he has always been my Prince Charming.' In his Strictly debut series, Aljaz clinched the prize with model and TV presenter Abbey Clancy during the first all-female final on the show. In 2017, he reached the final with partner Gemma Atkinson but missed out to winners Joe McFadden and Katya Jones. Speaking about his decision to leave the show, he said: 'Janette and I were a team and helped choreograph each other's routines and every time I needed a shoulder or a hug she was there. 'But last year was different because, for the first time ever, I felt like I was doing Strictly on my own.' Janette added: 'The day he made the announcement we were literally holding hands with tears in our eyes because it was a bittersweet feeling. 'We always say it was never a Strictly curse for us, it was always a blessing and the best thing for us - in our marriage, in our careers and everything.' The couple said they would like to present a TV show together, inspired by husband and wife duo Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford.",

It's A Sin debuted in January 2021, telling the story of a group of friends living through the AIDS crisis in the late 1980s and early 90s. The show was met with a wave of acclaim, which eventually included an impressive seven nominations at the TV Baftas, more than any other show. Cast members Olly Alexander, Lydia West, Omari Douglas, Callum Scott Howells and David Carlyle all received recognition for their performances in It's A Sin, while the show itself was also in the running for Best Mini-Series. A scene in which Colin discovered he had AIDS was also nominated in the Must-See TV Moment category. However, during Sunday night's ceremony, It's A Sin didn't pick up any of the awards it was nominated for, which has not gone down well with its loyal fans: Many viewers were also confused by the fact that clips of It's A Sin used during the ceremony appeared to be muted: The acting prizes the It's A Sin cast lost out on went to Matthew MacFadyen for Succession, Jodie Comer for Help and Sean Bean for Time, which was also the recipient of the Best Mini-Series award. Meanwhile, Rose Ayling-Ellis and Giovanni Pernice's 'silent' routine from this year's Strictly Come Dancing was named Must-See TV Moment, the only award voted for by members of the public. It's worth noting that It's A Sin did win in the Best Director: Fiction category at the Bafta TV Craft Awards, which took place last month. The show was also named Best New Drama at last year's National Television Awards, as chosen by the public.",

In a speech on Monday morning, the defence secretary accused leaders of Russia's armed forces of 'amorality and corruption'. And he condemned the 'unprovoked, illegal, senseless and self-defeating' invasion of Ukraine. It came as Putin used a speech in Moscow marking Russia's Victory Day holiday to claim the war was necessary to ward off 'an absolutely unacceptable threat just next to our borders'. He has repeatedly alleged that Ukraine was planning to attack Russia - which Kyiv has flatly denied. 'The danger was rising by day,' he said, adding that 'Russia has pre-emptively repulsed an aggression'. Putin again scolded the West for failing to heed the Russian demands for security guarantees and a rollback to Nato's expansion, arguing that it also left Moscow no other choice but to invade. But he did not give any signal as to the next phase of the conflict. In his speech, Wallace said: 'Through the invasion of Ukraine, Putin, his inner circle, his generals, are now mirroring fascism and tyranny 77 years ago, repeating the errors of the last century's totalitarian regimes. 'Their unprovoked, illegal, senseless and self-defeating invasion of Ukraine, their attacks against innocent civilians on their homes, their widespread atrocities, including the deliberate targeting of women and children. 'They all corrupt the memory of past sacrifices and Russia's once proud global reputation. He added: 'The response to this failure by the Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine has in itself been a disgraceful display of self-preservation, doubling down on failure, anger, dishonesty and scapegoating.' The most intense combat in recent days has taken place in eastern Ukraine, as Russia seeks to capture the crucial southern port city of Mariupol.",

The actor first found fame as tough cop George Carter in The Sweeney opposite John Thaw and later went on to star in the hugely successful series, Minder. A statement from his family said: 'We are deeply saddened to announce that our beloved Dennis, passed away very peacefully in hospital in Spain, on Sunday afternoon, with Pam by his side. 'The family kindly ask that our privacy is respected at this very difficult time.'  Little Britain star Matt Lucas was one of the first to pay his respects... Dennis played Gerry Standing in the BBC's New Tricks, and throughout his career other TV roles included ITV's Where The Heart Is, The Canterbury Tales and Moses Jones, both for the BBC. He became well-known for singing the theme songs to many of his shows, and was caricatured by David Walliams in Little Britain as a result. His last film role was in Never Too Late in 2020, which was filmed in Australia. Born in London, he was educated at the Corona Theatre School, and began his showbiz career at a young age, and following a role for the Children's Film Foundation, was invited to join Stratford's Royal Shakespeare Company. A role in the BBC's adaptation of the Just William books followed, and the actor would, in his later years, reflect on some of the different roles he undertook. In 2009, he starred in the BBC's hard-hitting drama Moses Jones, a role which he said at the time, he enjoyed because it cast him in a different light. 'I really enjoyed it, because it was a very different kind of character - and that's important. On television in Britain, I'm sort of the cheeky chappie, everybody's mate, but I've never played anything like that in the theatre. It's strange that you get cast as different things in different parts of the media,' he told PA at the time. His role in 2004's drama New Tricks marked his return to a long-running show for the first time in a decade and saw him star alongside acting stalwarts James Bolam and Alun Armstrong. His character Gerry was part of the cold case squad, who were often at odds with their detective boss, played by Amanda Redman. He had been married several times, including to the actress Rula Lenska until 1998, and his daughter, Hannah, became a TV star in her own right - landing a role in EastEnders as Laura Beale. His extensive career also included numerous stints on the stage and he played Alfred Doolittle in a Royal National Theatre production of My Fair Lady, as well as starring in a tour production of Don't Dress For Dinner. He also starred in productions of Twelfth Night, Edward Bond's Saved at the Royal Court Theatre and Sergeant Musgrave's Dance. The BBC's chief content officer, Charlotte Moore, issued a statement on behalf of the corporation, saying: 'We are incredibly sad to hear of the passing of Dennis Waterman, an unforgettable actor who will be missed by us all. Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.' His talents did not end with acting and he had a keen interest in music, having recorded albums and singles, including songs which charted in Australia, New Zealand and Britain.",

The Baywatch star said it had been a 'challenging few months' in an Instagram post she shared on Mother's Day. 'On this Mother's Day we can't help but reflect on these last few months and the rollercoaster we've been on, which we now know, so many people have also experienced,' she captioned the picture. 'After 100 plus days in the NICU, our little girl is finally home. 'Every family's journey is unique and requires a certain level of faith, and while ours was a challenging few months, what becomes abundantly clear, in retrospect, is how precious and perfect every moment is.' In the photo, Priyanka holds Malti against her chest as her singer husband holds the baby's hand. 'Our next chapter begins now, and our baby is truly a badass. Let's get it MM! Mommy and Daddy love you,' she wrote.  'Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers and caretakers in my life and out there. You make it look so easy. Thank you.' She added: 'Also.. there is no one I'd rather do this with than you. Thank you for making me a mama @nickjonas I love you.' The couple also took the opportunity to thank the doctors and nurses at Rady Children's Hospital, La Jolla and Cedars-Sinai, Los Angeles, for their care and support. The couple, who married in 2018, confirmed in April that they had named their first child Malti Marie Chopra Jonas.

Everyone from It's A Sin star Olly Alexander to Hugh Grant were linked to the role, but it's fair to say that Sex Education's Ncuti Gatwa, who plays the beloved Eric, wasn't on many people's Doctor Who bingo cards (our bad, Ncuti).  Now, following the announcement that the 29-year-old will be the 14th Time Lord, we're all feeling (a) like idiots for overlooking him and (b) very excited indeed that this young, Black, queer star will be taking up residence in the Tardis. As showrunner Russell T Davis put it so perfectly: 'The future is here'. And it's not just your average Doctor Who fans who agree... Ncuti is equally pumped about his new role too, saying: 'Unlike the Doctor, I may only have one heart but I am giving it all to this show. 'There aren't quite the words to describe how I'm feeling.

'This role and show means so much to so many around the world, including myself, and each one of my incredibly talented predecessors has handled that unique responsibility and privilege with the utmost care. 'I will endeavour my upmost to do the same. Russell T Davies is almost as iconic as the Doctor himself and being able to work with him is a dream come true. His writing is dynamic, exciting, incredibly intelligent and fizzing with danger. 'An actor's metaphorical playground. The entire team have been so welcoming and truly give their hearts to the show. 'And so as much as it's daunting, I'm aware I'm joining a really supportive family.' Queer As Folk and It's A Sin writer Russell T Davies, who is returning as the programme's showrunner after leaving Doctor Who in 2009, promised fans Ncuti would be 'spectacular' in the role. 'Sometimes talent walks through the door and it's so bright and bold and brilliant, I just stand back in awe and thank my lucky stars. 'Ncuti dazzled us, seized hold of the Doctor and owned those Tardis keys in seconds. 'It's an honour to work with him, and a hoot, I can't wait to get started.' Neither can we.",

The shadow health secretary was passionately defending the leader of his party after a weekend of new headlines about so-called 'beergate', an event where Starmer has been accused of breaching social distancing rules. Although Durham Police previously said they believed no offence was committed, the case has now been reopened following repeated calls from the Conservative Party. Asked what Starmer would do if he were found to have broken lockdown rules and fined on BBC Breakfast, Streeting replied: 'I just don't think that's going to happen, I'm not going to entertain that prospect.' Streeting also mocked the memo published by the Daily Mail over the weekend, which suggested that the meal Starmer was caught eating indoors (with a beer) was planned in advance. This comes after the Labour leader said that the gathering was spontaneous. The Labour MP replied: 'One of the remarkable things about that story in the Mail, was that it was entirely unsurprising and non-revelatory for anyone who has been involved in an election campaign. 'When you go on visits around the country, as Lisa Nandy said yesterday morning, senior politicians like Keir Starmer don't just rock up in a place like Durham and wander around aimlessly.' He said it was 'reasonable' that Starmer's dinner in Durham would have been arranged, so the memo does not 'contradict anything' that the Labour leader has previously said about beergate. Streeting claimed: 'I don't understand the controversy and certainly don't understand the comparison between that and the regular repeated rule-breaking in Downing Street and the lies of the prime minister.' He repeated that the big difference is that Johnson has been fined for attending a party in Downing Street in June 2020. 'And in this case, let's not forget, that police have looked at this before,' Streeting continued. 'OK, they're looking at it again now, there's been lots of calls particularly from the Conservative Party for them to do so.' He claimed that he expected the same outcome as the first time the police looked at the incident, adding: 'I saw nothing in that memo in the Daily Mail which I hadn't heard before.' When pressed as to why the Labour leader had cancelled his media event today, prompting speculation he was avoiding difficult questions, Streeting said he had 'no idea' why. But, he said Starmer had been answering journalists' questions wherever he's been across the country, so it's 'simply not true' that he's been ducking scrutiny from the press. Streeting echoed this message when he appeared on Sky News later on. He promised that the police's ongoing investigation into the prime minister and new probe into the Labour leader is very different, as Starmer will not be found guilty. Streeting said: 'What it will show is the stark contrast between Boris Johnson who was fined, Boris Johnson who lied about there being any events under his roof.' He also claimed it was 'perfectly legitimate campaigning activity', compared to the rule-breaking in Tories. He went on to describe the Daily Mail's memo revelation as: 'Breaking news: Keir Starmer has dinner.' 'I don't think people out there around the country think Keir Starmer is the kind of bloke who goes out there breaking the rules and getting smashed on a campaign. 'This is all stretching credibility!' When Sky's Kay Burley pointed out that Labour had not initially admitted deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner was also at the gathering, Streeting said it was a 'genuine cock-up' from the party to say she wasn't there, but that there was clearly 'nothing to gain' by lying about it intentionally. He added that he was 'frustrated, because all this is about is trying to drag an innocent man into the mud'. But, as Burley pointed out.: 'it's never the cock-up, it's the cover-up.' She noted that in January, Starmer said Johnson 'needs to do the decent thing and resign', when the prime minister was just under investigation - as the Labour leader himself is now. But, Streeting said Johnson had already been found to be lying to parliament at that point. 'How the Conservatives have the barefaced cheek to come out, gloating and demanding resignations and throwing round accusations of hypocrisy, I don't know. They should get their house in order.'",

    "a2fad71f6c631acad3a17b06911196258d9e607fa518117201b1d098": "Soaring numbers of people in Britain are going without food due to the cost of living crisis, according to new research. A survey by the Food Foundation found that some 7.3m adults live in households that skipped meals in April either because they could not afford food or because they could not access it. That compares to 4.7m adults in January - an increase of 57 per cent in just three months. The survey also found that 2.4m adults have not eaten for a whole day because they could not afford or get access to food. The Food Foundation said rising energy costs, allied to increased prices in the shops, were leading to greater food insecurity. Anna Taylor, the organisation's executive director, said 'The extremely rapid rise in food insecurity since January points to a catastrophic situation for families. 'Food insecurity puts families under extreme mental stress and forces people to survive on the cheapest calories which lead to health problems. 'The situation is rapidly turning from an economic crisis to a health crisis. Foodbanks cannot possibly be expected to solve this.  'The government needs to realise the boat is sinking for many families and it needs to be fixed. Bailing out with emergency food parcels is not going towork.' Professor Sir Michael Marmot of University College London said 'Food is basic, but so is security. Both are vital to good health. 'If one household in seven is food insecure, society is failing in a fundamental way. These figures on food insecurity are all the more chilling because the problem is soluble, but far from being solved it is getting worse.' Shadow work and pensions secretary Jon Ashworth said: 'These are devastating findings that reveal the acute levels of hunger impacting families and children nationwide caused by the Conservative cost of living crisis.  'The Tory cuts to Universal Credit, rocketing energy bills, their punishing tax rise and real terms pensions cut is pushing more and more working people, families and pensioners to food bank queues.  'With warnings of inflation heading to 10 per cent it's clear Boris Johnson has lost control of the cost of living crisis causing devastating hardship across the country.' Last week, environment secretary George Eustice sparked anger when he suggested families buy supermarket own brand food to help make ends meet. A government spokesperson said: 'We recognise the pressures on the cost of living and we are doing what we can to help, including spending PS22bn across the next financial year to support people with energy bills and cut fuel duty. 'For the hardest hit, we're putting an average of PS1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families on universal credit, have also boosted the minimum wage by more than PS1,000 a year for full-time workers and our household support fund is there to help with the cost of everyday essentials.'",
    "4b50282e24392f0380a1ce9bbedce03bd90cd8e35122e40208012e31": "Like many parents, Angela Scanlon enjoys sharing baths with her two young children. But the family takes things one step further, ditching their clothes and dancing around the bedroom for regular 'nudie discos'.  'I love being naked!' the TV presenter and podcast host says with a laugh from the other side of our video call. 'And actually, I think it's really, really important. Florence Welch is on full tilt, Dog Days Are Over, and away we go!' Scanlon isn't a naturist, although she did present a documentary about the lifestyle once, and insists it's 'the least sexy thing you've ever seen'. But her liberal attitude to nudity stems from a desire to instil body confidence in her two daughters, Ruby, four, and Marnie, three months. 'It's those little things that I think are joyful in the moment, but also will hopefully allow for Ruby - and Marnie when she gets to that point - to realise her body is something that can be enjoyed. It is not there for consumption, it's not there to be looked at. It's actually hers to use and to feel,' she says.  The 38-year-old is particularly passionate about this, because from the age of 17 she struggled with an eating disorder that continued to impact her until her early thirties.  She's speaking publicly about her experience of anorexia and bulimia for the first time, having decided to write about it in her upcoming book, Joyrider.  In the book, she recalls being 'taught' how to make herself sick when she overheard another girl talking about it in the toilets during her final year of school. The idea appealed, she thinks, because her body had suddenly changed from a girl's to a woman's and she didn't know how to process it.  'I had an ankle injury and I stopped dancing and suddenly, I grew breasts and started to feel like my body was not my own anymore,' she tells HuffPost UK.  'The idea of womanhood felt quite terrifying. I think it is so difficult for so many young people - young women, especially - that sense of being out of control, of being thrust into this period in your life that you're not really prepared for, that you didn't really ask for. 'I don't think we're ever really given the tools or the skills or the language to understand how complex that is, and so we feel very alone.'  For the next 15 years, Scanlon continued to have flare ups of disordered eating, which usually coincided with times of feeling out of control.  But as her career took off - first presenting T In The Park and the Baftas red carpet, and later co-presenting the Robot Wars reboot in 2016 - she replaced her addiction to controlling food with an addiction to work. 'I just literally swapped one for the other,' she says, admitting that it wasn't necessarily a healthier replacement. Nor did it make her the nicest person; she once sacked an assistant because she said she wouldn't work on Sundays. It wasn't until she paused for maternity leave in 2018 that Scanlon realised her relationship with work was unsustainable. A whole heap of therapy and self-reflection helped her process where her need for control stemmed from. And she now recognises that self-identifying as an 'over-achiever' has its problems.  'It doesn't happen overnight, like I kind of imagined it might,' she says of recovery. 'It requires a lot more work, which nobody really wants to hear - myself included.' Thankfully, the physical changes of her pregnancy didn't cause a relapse in her eating disorder, but Scanlon was 'acutely aware' of the possibility. 'I focused on the nutrition side of things rather than anything else and knowing that my responsibility first and foremost was to nourish a baby,' she says. 'I was very, very, very careful not to allow myself to slip back into that.' Despite the movement to destigmitise mental illness in recent years - with a number of celebrities sharing personal stories - Scanlon felt the need to hide this part of her life until now. 'You know, I think I've wanted to talk about it for a long time. But then I was so afraid that that would be converting - I'd be defined as that [person] from a career point of view,' she says. As a '90s girl', she distinctly remembers the reaction when Geri Horner (nee Halliwell) first spoke about her experience of bulimia. 'She wrote about it in her autobiography - about going through a bin in George Michael's house to get some cake - and it was kind of ridiculed,' Scanlon says.  But today, she feels ready to speak out, in a bid to free herself from the secrecy of her past and, hopefully, to help others. 'It was though a part of myself was constantly hidden,' she says. 'And I think that kind of chips away at you, actually, without even really being aware of that.' Despite the seriousness of this topic, Scanlon is jovial during our call. Marnie is asleep, so she's taken the opportunity to go out for a walk in the sunshine, turning her phone's camera to show off a tree in full blossom. 'Look at that!' she exclaims. 'Gorgeous!' Joyrider is part memoir, part self-help guide, where Scanlon details her journey towards this happier place. She's quick to admit she's no expert, but instead describes herself as a 'human guinea pig', who's tried every self-help hack out there and is willing to lay bare her findings. It's not expensive retreats, lotions or potions that transformed her life, but the simple concept of practising gratitude. She describes the active choice of taking a more grateful path as 'joyriding'. For example, you can sit in a traffic jam and stress about being late for work. Or, you can pause to consider that your boss will probably get over it, and this is 15 minutes of stillness to listen to your favourite radio show.  When you take this path, you're 'joyriding'.   Of course, having the emotional capacity to 'look on the bright side' takes a huge amount of privilege; it's simply not possible when you're facing an acute threat, such as the cost of living crisis or any recent or ongoing trauma.  But there's enough self-awareness, humour and honesty in the pages of her book to avoid toxic positivity. For Scanlon, entering a new, lighter phase in her life has meant processing the darker times in her past, with the acknowledgement that life will also be a balance of both.  'That idea of finding joy, it seemed so out of reach, because I had kind of numbed and tapped out of all of the emotions [of life], because everything felt too much to bear. And I think that's what an eating disorder - or any sort of addiction - allows you to do. It's a kind of escape for those big feelings,' she says.   'But you know, my experience has been that in order to really feel the good stuff, or what we call the good stuff, you have to have dug around and allowed yourself to feel those kind of scary, awful feelings. You don't really get to just experience one without the other. 'There's something very hopeful about that - to my mind, anyway - that when you're rooting around and you're in that area where everything feels a bit hopeless and painful, actually, you can take a bit of comfort in the notion that that's part of the gig, and that the good shit comes afterwards.'

    "dbc772766f3ed2a179db9d78df95360fe56243e64b739abdee68e651": "You're reading Life-Work Balance, a series aiming to redirect our total devotion to work into prioritising our personal lives. Want to go for a massage on Wednesday? Or how about a karaoke sesh with pals on Tuesday?  Your initial thought might 'no, not on a work/school night', but that way of thinking might not be optimal if you want to have a better grip on your work-life balance. Most of us schedule fun things to do on a weekend, reserving social activities, life-admin, relaxation, recovery and everything else for a mere two days. And before you know it, it's Monday and you have another work week to get through.  We've been conditioned to count down the days to the weekend, then barely blink before it's over. But maybe we're going about it all wrong. Why do our personal lives take up a secondary role in our schedule? The obvious answer is that of course, work drains us out, with many of us working more hours than before, unable to switch off, or simply too tired to do anything else. But adding a bit of fun in this way can be exciting, necessary even, to break the monotony of the week and allow you to assert some control over your life. It could also make you feel better about work, thanks to the emotional respite you'll gain.  We're not talking about hobbies either - though these are important, incremental activities that cultivate progress out of the things we enjoy, be it exercise, a skill, or even something that helps us make extra money - we mean random events that brings pure joy without expectation of getting better.  This is exactly what Nessa, 26, who works in professional services in London, does. She's started a habit where each week, she plans one weekday post-work activity which can include food, going to the cinema, a concert, theatre etc. She tells HuffPost: 'I started doing this because working from home means it's quite tough to have a separation between home life and working life. Having something to look forward to really helps me to break up the week and stay motivated. 'For instance if I'm dreading a busy week on a Sunday, it's nice to know I'll be meeting friends for an exercise class on a Tuesday or watching a film on a Thursday!' But let's not ignore that many of these pastimes come with a price tag and not all of us may be in a position to spend, especially given the squeeze on our wallets right now. However, not all activities require money. You could organise a random games night with your friends, or a pot-luck dinner. How about a scavenger hunt? Or an amateur painting class in the living room, a movie marathon, a sleepover (perfect if you're both/all working from home), a sports day, a waterfight.  Don't have friends who are available? Try incorporating some solo adventures, or maybe even make some new pals in new settings - the point is shifting our focus away from work and taking back some time and power for ourselves.  Nessa adds: 'I think it's also helped me be more confident and explore activities by myself which I've really enjoyed.' The point is adding playfulness into our lives. When we're children, our lives are centred on playing but as we get older, we abandon such frivolities.  But, there's merit in bringing these back, says Catherine Price, the author of The Power of Fun, who also teaches people a course on how to have fun. '''True fun is the confluence of playfulness, connection and flow,' she tells HuffPost. 'They provide enjoyment, with knowledge and skills that might help you discover more opportunities for fun.' So how can you go about changing up your week? After all, you can't just plan to go to the theatre or do a social activity with friends every week - it's just not sustainable.  Price says while it's essential to incorporate opportunities for fun into our lives on a regular basis, we need to think holistically.  'I try to break down my fun into 'microdoses' and 'booster shots.' Microdoses are small things that you can put on your schedule on a regular basis that don't take too much work to organise and that might lead to fun - say, a regular lunch date with a friend, or a regular class (for example, I go to my guitar class every Wednesday). 'Then, a 'booster shot' is something that takes more work and planning, but has a bigger bang for your buck - like, say, a vacation or a weekend away with friends. Everyone's blend of microdoses and booster shots will be different; the point is simply to always have something to look forward to. 'The more you do so, the more likely it will be for you to experience playfulness, connection and flow (which are enjoyable and good for us even on their own) -- and, therefore, to have more experiences of true fun.' So, what are you doing this week?  Life-Work Balance questions the status quo of work culture, its mental and physical impacts, and radically reimagines how we can change it to work for us. ",
    "8756fbec8f92b6e2cd64c821eb0683a06a2cfa77025e1297f7f3e764": "This month marks 25 years since Katrina And The Waves stormed to Eurovision glory with the anthemic Love Shine A Light. Of course, that also means it's now been a quarter of a century since a UK entrant triumphed in the contest, a fact which is not lost on Katrina Leskanich. 'Twenty-five years, are you kidding me right now?' she tells HuffPost UK, shortly before the anniversary. 'It's kind of unbelievable on several fronts. In a country that has such a rich heritage of music and talent, it's incredible that it's been that long since the UK has won.' Katrina puts this lack of success in recent years down to 'the wrong choice and the wrong approach', but says things are 'looking better' in 2022 thanks to the UK's much-hyped entrant Sam Ryder. 'I think he's strong, he's good-looking, he can sing, he can deliver, he wrote the song, he has credibility - and 12 million followers on social media,' she says. 'It's the whole package. So, fingers crossed.' However, despite being firmly Team GB when it comes to Eurovision over the last 25 years, the American-born singer admits that some years have made it easier to support than others. 'As you can imagine, it's been challenging for me over the years, when I've been asked 'what do you think of this year's UK entry?', and I know in my heart that it's a fail,' she confesses. 'I don't want to criticise anybody or throw anybody under the bus. Everybody wants to get behind the UK entry, but damn that's hard when you know it's not working, and you know it's not going to work. 'And nobody wants to be impolite or dash the hopes of somebody who's got a big task at hand. Obviously, I want to try and instil confidence in people. But like I said, some years have been more challenging than others. Here's what else Katrina had to say when we took a stroll down Eurovision memory lane with her in the lead-up to this year's contest... Were you always a fan of Eurovision, and how has your opinion of it changed over time? I'd never seen Eurovision before we did it, and when we were asked if we had a song we could put forward for Eurovision, I wasn't clear what they were talking about. The two English boys in the group said, 'we do have a song called Love Shine A Light' - but it was in the bottom drawer, because we all thought it was too Eurovision-y for us to put out on a record. When we gave it to Jonathan King [executive producer of the selection show The Great British Song Contest], he went screaming to the hills with it and said, 'this is an out-and-out winner, we're putting it forward'. And my opinion of Eurovision has changed as Eurovision has changed. Back in the dark ages, when I did it and there were 24 contestants, it was very different. Now, it's grown and become more of a spectacle, more of a production, more bells and whistles - and hey, why not? What's your first memory of watching Eurovision at home? After we got through the Great British Song Contest and were declared the group that was going to represent the UK, I was sent 12 video tapes - twelve video tapes - of past Eurovisions. So I had a marathon weekend, where I watched every Eurovision since the time it began up until 1996.  And that's when I was very enlightened. And I did think, 'what in the hell is this?'. With all the clowns and the milkmaids and the babushkas and the grannies, it's like one poodle short of a circus. Come on! It was extraordinary. But I also thought, 'wow, Love Shine A Light is made for this event', because there is so much drama in that song, and that's what you need. Do you have a favourite memory of being part of Eurovision? It has to be that iconic moment from lockdown, when they used Love Shine A Light and everybody sang a line from it. That was almost a bigger moment than the win, because that was very, very emotional. There was not a dry eye in the house, I mean the poodle was crying. It was very, very sentimental, and very, very moving. So that would be the moment, aside from the win, We were constantly told by everybody, 'you can't win it', even when the votes were coming in! Even when we had so many points coming in that nobody could catch us! I f you watch the night back, and you listen to Terry Wogan's commentary, you'll see everybody couldn't believe [we won]! I remember looking up at the booth where Terry Wogan was, and he was holding a glass of champagne in one hand and a glass of Guinness in the other, and a glass of Irish whisky balanced on top of his head. It was that kind of night. It was insane! Who are you rooting for at Eurovision this year? Are you kidding? Of course, I will always be rooting for the UK. And some people say, 'well how could you want that, you'll lose your crown?'. But you never lose your crown. [Someone else winning] doesn't mean you're no longer a winner, it just means, 'great news, there's another one'. Obviously, the second country I'd be rooting would be Ukraine. I am half-Ukrainian, and I can't think of a better song or a better moment to show our support. It's not like the song is terrible and we're all going to vote for a terrible song - the song is very good, and we're all going to vote for it because we feel so heartbroken over this event that's happening. What are your three all-time favourite Eurovision songs? One that I had to include was Eres Tu by Mocedades. It's very, very moving, I've got goosebumps talking about it. Sweet, moving and anthemic, with a beautiful, beautiful melody. L'Oiseau Et L'Enfant by Marie Myriam. I had to sing it in French class in high school, but I had no idea what it was, or where it came from. And I didn't know it was Eurovision because I didn't know what Eurovision was in 1977 when I was singing it. And, of course, Loreen's Euphoria. That's actually my favourite of all time. Come on. Come on! When that song came out, it was a Love Shine A Light moment where as soon as you heard it, you knew nothing could touch it. It was 100% it, the whole package. Why is Eurovision still so important? It's one of those events that brings everybody together. It unites people, for good or bad. And it's also enormous fun!  I think the more outrageous and the more ridiculous the acts can be, the better. Because for me, it's pure entertainment. I don't like to see song after song that's a dreary ballad.  This interview has been edited for clarity and length. We'll be publishing an interview with a different Eurovision legend every day leading up to this year's live final on Saturday 14 May. Come back tomorrow when we'll be speaking to another former champion, Alexander Rybak. Katrina's new single Holiday is out now. Take a listen below:",
    "87152e05f4446da06dd9e2811460738c12faa6e26a2eec7ae70dceac": "The increase in the cost of living has affected everyone, especially parents. As the price of gas, electricity and food continue to soar, parents are left wondering how they can save money. And a huge expense that most parents pay for is childcare. The average cost for a part-time nursery place is PS7,000, according to the NCT, and some parents pay even higher fees if they require childcare for under twos, or full-time childcare. In fact, parents are now paying 2.5% more for childcare for children under two than they were a year ago, according one study. And a recent survey by Pregnant then Screwed and Mumsnet found two-thirds of respondents are paying as much or more for childcare than for rent or mortgage payments.  It's not always possible to save money on childcare, when really, parents need nationwide government intervention to help. However, we'll also take any tips we can get on lessoning the burden. Below, the consumer watchdog Which? has rounded up six potential ways to cut your childcare costs, including how to apply for any benefits or schemes you may have missed that you're eligible for.  1. Working parents can claim tax-free childcare: Tax-free childcare is a government scheme that pays working parents a top-up based on their childcare costs. Parents are able to claim PS500 every three months for each child looked after by an approved childcare provider, sent via an online account. Parents that meet the eligibility criteria can apply through HMRC. 2. Check if you're eligible for tax credits or universal credit Both Working Tax Credit and Universal Credit offer extra support for families, where the government gives the recipient extra money towards paying for childcare.  To qualify for Working Tax Credit, the person claiming, and their partner, must both work at least 16 hours a week. One person can be out of work if they are entitled to carer's allowance, in prison, in hospital, or incapacitated. It is possible to save up to 70% of childcare costs, up to a maximum of PS175 per week for one child, or PS300 for two or more children. Likewise, people claiming Universal Credit can get 85% of their childcare costs covered, to a maximum of PS646 a month for one child, or PS1,108 for two or more children. 3. Take advantage of free childcare hours In England, there are schemes available for parents with very young children The 'free childcare for two-year-olds' scheme is for those who receive certain benefits. In addition, everyone is eligible for 15 hours of free childcare per week for children aged three or four. This is for 38 weeks a year, but parents can opt to take fewer hours to spread this over more weeks. Those on lower incomes might be able to claim 30 hours of free childcare a week, as long as they and their partners are earning at least the national minimum wage or living wage.  In Scotland, all three and four-year-olds are entitled to around 30 hours of free childcare a year. There is also a scheme for two-year-olds for those on certain benefits and low incomes. In Wales, all three and four-year-olds can get 30 hours of free childcare a week. The 30 hours is made up of a minimum of 10 hours of early education a week and a maximum of 20 hours a week of childcare.  In Northern Ireland, three and four-year-olds get 12 and a half hours of free childcare per week during term time through a funded preschool place. 4. Find cheap and free holiday activities The Family and Childcare Trust lists organisations in local areas and provides information about childcare and family services. There are often youth groups and community centres which offer some form of help during the holidays. 5. Check out local charities Organisations like the YMCA, local church groups or local authority play schemes could be good places to check for free after-school clubs and classes. These are intended for parents who are unable to pick their children up after school, which can save a lot of money compared to a nanny or childminder. However, services can be limited to only serving certain schools in the local area. 6. Try 'parent sharing' with a friend For parents with friends who have similar schedules and childcare needs, a cheaper or free childcare option is to consider looking after each other's children. While this erases the advantage of professional childcare, it allows children to socialise.",
    "0601affbddbfa47a52c89cf20c0f686dadd71de604a1f7a83724aadb": "Despite a devastating set of local election results, many Tories were cock-a-hoop on Friday night. With exquisite timing, Durham Constabulary had announced that they would, after all, be re-opening their investigation into whether Keir Starmer broke lockdown rules by having curry and a beer with colleagues in April, 2021. After weeks of miserable headlines over lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street, during which time the Labour leader had repeatedly called on Boris Johnson to resign, it was a chance for the Conservatives to finally get back on the front foot. Many of them grabbed that opportunity with both hands, gleefully pointing out that it would be the height of hypocrisy were Starmer not to abide by the standards he had set others and pledge to quit if handed a fixed penalty notice. They included senior cabinet figures like Nadine Dorries as well as foreign office minister James Cleverly. But not for the first time, they had not really thought through the consequences of what they were saying. Just imagine for a moment what would happen were Starmer to be fined and then announce his resignation. It would undoubtedly be hugely disruptive for Labour, who would again be thrown into a divisive leadership contest at a time when they should be focusing all their energies on holding the prime minister and his government to account. But it would also throw the spotlight back onto the PM's repeated refusal to resign, despite the fact that he has been fined for attending a birthday party for himself in the Cabinet Office and there may well be further sanctions to come. People would rightly ask why it was right for the leader of the opposition to go, but not Johnson as well. As Patrick Maguire of The Times has revealed, more sensible Tories are aware of the dangers and discussing whether the party should tone down its attacks on Starmer. As David Simmonds MP told other members of the Tories' 2019 intake in a WhatsApp group: 'The only 'good' outcome I can see is if Starmer is fined and doesn't resign. Any other outcome just makes us look worse by comparison.' This also explains why Jacob Rees-Mogg also suggested to Andrew Neil that Starmer need not resign even if he is fined. He said: 'I think he should pay a fine and then talk about the issues of great importance to the nation.' Of course, Durham police may well stick to their original conclusion that no rules were broken by the Labour leader, who will then be able to turn his fire on the PM once again. But if they overturn their decision and decide he did contravene the law as it stood at the time, it will be devastating for him - but could well end up being fatal for Boris Johnson as well.",

The Brexit opportunities minister said the beergate affair was 'in the same category of seriousness' as the partygate scandal, which he has previusly described as 'fluff'. Starmer's leadership of the Labour Party has been thrown into crisis after Durham Constabulary confirmed they were re-investigating whether he broke covid regulations in April, 2021, by having curry and beer with colleagues. He has previously called on Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, who were both handed fixed penalty notices by the Metropolitan Police for attending a birthday party in 10 Downing Street during lockdown, to resign. Some Tories have said Starmer should show consistency and quit if he, too, ended up being fined. Interviewed on Channel 4's The Andrew Neil Show, Rees-Mogg said: 'The difficulty for Sir Keir is he said - before any result of any investigation - that the Prime Minister should resign. 'Which sets a rather high standard and I think the issue for him is one of judgment.' Asked if Sir Keir should quit if he was found to have broken the law, Mr Rees-Mogg said: 'I think he should pay a fine and then talk about the issues of great importance to the nation.'  Speaking on Friday, Starmer said: 'As I've explained a number of times, we were working in the office, we stopped for something to eat. No party, no breach of the rules.   'The police obviously have got their job to do. We should let them get on with it but I'm confident no rules were broken.' The row has reignited bitter divisions in the Labour Party, amid claims a disgruntled former aide had directly contradicted Starmer's version of events in the Sunday Times. Shadow communities secretary Lisa Nandy has insisted Starmer did not break lockdown rules. She said: 'This is a guy who's self isolated six times during the pandemic, I don't know a single other person who did that. He is Mr Rules, he does not not break the rules, he was the director of public prosecutions, not somebody who goes around tearing up rules when it suits him, in stark contrast to the prime minister.'

The 29-year-old will become the 14th Doctor on the popular BBC show, after Jodie announced last July she would be leaving the role. Scottish actor Ncuti, who was born in Rwanda, has starred as Eric Effiong in Netflix's hugely popular Sex Education about socially awkward high school student Otis (Asa Butterfield) and his sex therapist mother Jean (Gillian Anderson). Speaking about his new role, Ncuti said: 'There aren't quite the words to describe how I'm feeling. A mix of deeply honoured, beyond excited and of course a little bit scared. This role and show means so much to so many around the world, including myself, and each one of my incredibly talented predecessors has handled that unique responsibility and privilege with the utmost care. 'I will endeavour my upmost to do the same. Russell T Davies is almost as iconic as the Doctor himself and being able to work with him is a dream come true. His writing is dynamic, exciting, incredibly intelligent and fizzing with danger. 'An actor's metaphorical playground. The entire team have been so welcoming and truly give their hearts to the show. 'And so as much as it's daunting, I'm aware I'm joining a really supportive family. Unlike the Doctor, I may only have one heart but I am giving it all to this show.' In 2020 Ncuti was named the winner of the actor category at the Scottish Bafta's for his role in Sex Education, and has been nominated at this year's Bafta TV awards, taking place on 8 May, in the best male performance in a comedy programme.   The actor previously told the Big Issue magazine, in 2020, about his move from Scotland to London when he was 21 and how he'd spent months before landing his role in Sex Education 'couch-surfing' adding: 'I didn't have a home. I was homeless. 'The only thing stopping me from being on the streets was the fact I had friends. But you can use up that goodwill. Or you feel scared to ask people for help. Your pride kicks in. 'So my life before Sex Education was so different. To go to my audition, I had to get my friend to transfer me 10 quid so I could top up my Oyster card.' Jodie took over the Tardis in 2017 as the first female Doctor. Queer As Folk and It's A Sin writer Russell T Davies is returning as the programme's showrunner after departing the show in 2009. The writer, who was responsible for Doctor Who's revival in 2005, will be back to celebrate the show's 60th anniversary in 2023, the BBC previously said. He said: 'The future is here and it's Ncuti! Sometimes talent walks through the door and it's so bright and bold and brilliant, I just stand back in awe and thank my lucky stars. 'Ncuti dazzled us, seized hold of the Doctor and owned those Tardis keys in seconds. 'It's an honour to work with him, and a hoot, I can't wait to get started. I'm sure you're dying to know more, but we're rationing ourselves for now, with the wonderful Jodie's epic finale yet to come. 'But I promise you, 2023 will be spectacular!' The announcement was teased by Russell and Ncuti on Instagram, with a post featuring two heart emojis, a plus symbol and a blue square. BBC chief content officer Charlotte Moore said: 'Ncuti has an incredible dynamism, he's a striking and fearless young actor whose talent and energy will set the world alight and take Doctor Who on extraordinary adventures under Russell T Davies' new era.'   Georgia Tennant, wife of former Doctor Who star David Tennant and daughter of Peter Davison, who also played the Doctor, reacted to the news that Gatwa will take over from Jodie Whittaker, tweeting: 'Hello dad'. The BBC said further details would be announced in due course.",

But, folks... it looks like we might actually have a shot of winning Eurovision this year. This year, singer-songwriter Sam Ryder is representing the UK with his song Space Man, which has already had heavy rotation on both Radio 1 and Radio 2. He's also been doing the rounds on various TV shows around Europe, and having now landed in Turin, he's impressed Eurovision fans with both his rehearsal footage and press interviews. Following the news that the UK will be performing in the second half of the live final next week (usually seen as a more coveted spot in the running order), Sam has now risen up the rankings in terms of the bookies' odds. According to Oddschecker - who compare betting odds from around 25 of the UK's bookies - Sam has overtaken the representatives for both Italy and Sweden, and is now second favourite to win Eurovision on behalf of the UK for the first time in 25 years. Ukraine is still the firm favourite, where they'll be represented by Kalush Orchestra with their song Stefania. Speaking to journalists this week in Italy, Sam spoke about how winning the contest is not his main aim, and how he hopes he can change people in the UK's attitudes to Eurovision:  The UK has had a somewhat complicated relationship with Eurovision in recent years, infamously finishing with nul points for the second time in history in 2021 following James Newman's performance of Embers. It's now been a quarter of a century since we won the contest, with Katrina And The Waves' anthem Love Shine A Light. This year's Eurovision Song Contest final will air live on Saturday 14 May on BBC One.",

Durham Police have said they will re-investigate Conservative Party claims the Labour leader breached Covid regulations in April 2021. At the time of the Durham gathering there was a ban on indoor mixing between households, but there was an exemption for work. Labour has insisted that the curry was consumed between work events, meaning it was within the rules.  The Mail on Sunday published a memo which showed an hour and 20 minutes had been set aside for 'dinner' at Durham Miners Hall, after which the visit was due to end.  Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, told Sky News on Sunday that Starmer had 'a bunch of questions to answer' and accused him of 'rank double standards' and 'complete hypocrisy'. But Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, told the same broadcaster it was 'absurd' to compare the accusations against Starmer to Boris Johnson's 'serial partying'. She said rather than undermining Starmer's explanation, the Mail on Sunday report actually showed 'exactly' what happened. 'He went on a work visit, he stopped to eat at various times during the day as was factored into the work visit,' she said.  'This is a guy who's self isolated six times during the pandemic, I don't know a single other person who did that. 'He is Mr Rules, he does not not break the rules, he was the director of public prosecutions, not somebody who goes around tearing up rules when it suits him, in stark contrast to the prime minister.' She added it in no way was similar to Johnson 'who was under investigation by the police for 12 separate gatherings' which 'included karaoke parties, bring your own bottle parties, pub quizzes, suitcases full of wine being smuggled through the back door'. 'Keir Starmer went on a work visit and had a break to eat,' she said. 'It was not illegal to eat.' But separately, a source who was present told the Sunday Times: 'It has been claimed that Starmer worked during the curry and then after the curry. None of those two things happened. He did not go back to work to the best of my knowledge.' The row has also reignited internal Labour splits. Speaking to HuffPost UK, an ally of the Starmer blamed the briefing on 'an embittered former employee who can't get over the fact Jeremy Corbyn isn't leader any more'.  Diane Abbott also said Starmer should 'consider his position' if he is fined. The former shadow home secretary, a close ally of Corbyn, told LBC: 'I think this is a lot of hype built up by the Tory press, but if he were to get a fixed penalty notice he would have to consider his position.' Starmer told reporters on Saturday: 'As I have explained a number of times, I was working in the office, we stopped for something to eat. There was no party, no breach of rules, I am confident of that.' He said he would not resign and would lead Labour into the next general election. ",

However, during their performance in Manchester on Saturday night, the trio were moved to tears for a very different reason. During the show, Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall were performing their hit Secret Love Song - which they've repeatedly said is considered by the band to be an anthem for their LGBTQ fans - when they spotted a proposal in the crowd. 'Congratulations! I'm gonna cry!' Perrie shouted from the stage. As she tried to carry on with the routine, Perrie admitted she was struggling to contain her emotions, telling fans: 'Oh, I can't. I'm a sucker for love. I'm gone! I'm gone!' 'Let's sing it to them,' Jade then suggested, but all three members of the group found themselves unable to continue with their lines, instead inviting the arena to sing to the newly-engaged pair in the crowd.  More than a decade after being put together on The X Factor, Little Mix announced last year that they were planning to take a break from the group when their Confetti tour comes to an end.  In an interview published earlier this week, though, they made it clear that they had no intention of making their hiatus a permanent one. 'Honestly, we haven't even parted ways yet and we're already talking about when we're coming back!' Perrie joked. 'We're like, 'is two years away enough? Two and a bit years?'.' Little Mix's final show on their Confetti tour will take place at the O2 Arena, London on 14 May, but will also be live-streamed so fans around the world can watch what promises to be an emotional farewell for the chart-topping band.",
    "9796ca6dda233cacf4577d5ad6f148e3f4490f2ccf52254553b9cb04": "Britain's Got Talent bosses have spoken out in support of the show's latest Golden Buzzer act, after viewers discovered he'd previously appeared in various other shows in the same franchise. During Saturday night's episode, BGT hosts Ant and Dec gave their Golden Buzzer to Japanese magician Keiichi Iwasaki, after they were impressed with his impressive illusion act. Keiichi won over all four members of the panel, as well as the presenting duo, who gave him a fast pass to the next stage of the competition. However, after the episode aired, some viewers on social media took issue with the fact that BGT marks Keiichi's fifth time appearing on a Got Talent series. Previously, he auditioned for Bulgaria, Spain and Germany's equivalent talent shows, and even made it to the semi-finals of Italia's Got Talent in 2016 with one of the tricks showcased in his BGT audition. Responding to this criticism, a spokesperson for BGT defended Keiichi, insisting he's deserving of his spot on the show. 'As with many other entertainers who are hoping for success in the industry, Keiichi, a street performer, had previously auditioned on television shows in the past,' they told HuffPost UK. 'There are no rules that state this should prevent him from applying. All acts audition on the same basis and normal programme rules apply.' Responding to some headlines accusing Keiichi's involvement of being evidence of a 'fix', they added: 'These claims unnecessarily encourage negative trolling against our contestants and 'fix' claims are completely untrue. 'We have always been very open about who can apply for BGT. We look forward to our viewers tuning in to show their support to Keiichi.' BGT bosses were previously forced to defend another of this year's Golden Buzzer acts, Loren Allred, whose voice was featured in the hit film The Greatest Showman.

Speaking on Sunday morning, the deputy prime minister said he did not think the prime minister would face a no confidence vote from Tory MPs. 'I am confident that he can and will win the next election,' he told Sky News.  'What people vote in a set of mid-term elections and what they vote when you chose a government at a general election are two wholly different things.' But he admitted he faced a 'tough fight' to keep his own Esher and Walton seat in Surrey. On Thursday the Conservatives lost almost 500 council seats across the country as Labour and the Lib Dems both made gains. Conservative MPs have so far largely stood by the prime minister, despite the fallout from the partygate scandal and the cost of living crisis. But several grassroots leaders have questioned whether Johnson should remain in office. John Mallinson, leader of Carlisle City Council, hit out after Labour took control of the new Cumberland authority which will replace it. 'I just don't feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth,' he said. Labour made headline grabbing gains in London, chalked up victories along the south coast of England and leap-frogged the Conservatives into second place in Scotland. The Conservatives are also under pressure for a revival of the Lib Dems, who snatched wins across the so-called Tory Blue Wall in the south, including winning control of Somerset council. Many Tory MPs will be worried that combined, Labour and the Lib Dems will be able to rob the Conservatives of a majority at the next election, due in 2024. Raab admitted the election results had been 'challenging' and a 'mixed bag' for the Conservatives. Asked if the prime minister would face a confidence vote, Raab told Times Radio: 'No, I don't think so.' Speaking to Sky News, he denied the Queen's Speech on Tuesday would be a 'reset' for the government but admitted there was a 'message we must heed'. But told Sky News: 'What we're going to be focusing on this week is what our plans are to drive up the economy, protect the cost of living.'",

The former Sherlock star opened the show with a monologue in which he told viewers: 'I am thrilled to be back hosting Saturday Night Live. It's been a really fun, great week. 'I've got to be honest though, because most of the sketch writers this week, they pitched me sketches everyday, and most were about Doctor Strange. 'I love the guy and I love playing the character. The film's doing really well--but I have been in other films.' Among the past films he referenced later in the monologue was the Netflix drama The Power Of The Dog, for which he bagged his second Oscar nomination.  'Come on, man. I was nominated for an Oscar for that,' he joked. 'I did okay. I mean, I didn't win. I was beat by Will Smith.' As the audience laughed, Benedict quickly added: 'No, not physically.' Benedict was, of course, referencing the moment Will Smith slapped Chris Rock during the Academy Awards this year, after the comic made a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett-Smith.  Will issued a public apology following the incident and later resigned from the Film Academy. After an investigation was conducted, Oscars organisers ruled that the former Fresh Prince star was banned from attending the awards show for the next 10 years. 'The action we are taking today in response to Will Smith's behaviour is a step toward a larger goal of protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy,' a statement said. 'We also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted.'",

The victory in the Stormont contests was the first for a republican party and 'ushers in a new era' of politics, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O'Neill said. Her party is committed to a border poll on unification with Ireland, although that is not a likely prospect in the short term, with Raab pointing out that a majority of voters in Northern Ireland had not supported Sinn Fein's position. 'If you look at the results in Northern Ireland, 58% fully of people voted either for parties who support the Union or for parties who do not support constitutional change and that is the message from the people of Northern Ireland,' Raab told Sky News. 'We don't have an executive yet, I think the first priority, mindful of that 58% of people in Northern Ireland who are not calling for that kind of change, is to get the executive up and running.' O'Neill's hopes of becoming first minister in a powersharing executive hinge on the unionist DUP, the second largest party, joining an administration - something it has ruled out unless there are major changes to Northern Ireland's post-Brexit deal. Raab said the Government would take 'whatever measures are necessary' to resolve the issues around the protocol. But he refused to say whether action on the Northern Ireland Protocol would be included in Tuesday's Queen's Speech. He told Sky News: 'If anything, the outcome in Northern Ireland from those elections makes it clear it can't be put off.' He suggested it would be dealt with in the coming 'weeks and months', warning that stability in Northern Ireland was being 'imperilled' by the dispute over the protocol - which was agreed by Boris Johnson's Government as part of the Brexit divorce from the EU. The deadlock will increase tensions between Westminster and Brussels, with the UK insisting all options remain on the table - including the possibility of unilaterally scrapping elements of the deal. That could trigger a major breakdown in relations between the UK and European Union. The protocol effectively creates checks on goods flowing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland in order to allow an open border with Ireland, which is within the EU's single market and customs union. 'We will deal with the situation, we will take whatever measures are necessary to protect the economic as well as the constitutional integrity of Northern Ireland,' Raab said. He indicated that the protocol had been used as a 'political device' by Brussels. Ireland's Europe minister Thomas Byrne said 'a decisive majority' of the MLAs elected to Stormont want to make the protocol work and called on the UK to 'engage in a renewed way with the European Union' on the issue.",

Durham Police have said they will re-investigate claims the party leader broke lockdown rules while having an Indian takeaway and drinks with colleagues. At the time of the gathering, in April 2021, social distancing rules remained in place, although there were exemptions for work meetings. Starmer - who called for Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak to resign after they were fined for breaking lockdown rules - has insisted no rules were broken as it was just a short break for food, after which he went back to work. But the Mail on Sunday published a memo which showed an hour and 20 minutes had been set aside for 'dinner' at Durham Miners Hall, after which the visit was due to end. Separately, the Sunday Times quoted an eyewitness present at the event who insisted no work was done after the meal.

The sports legend has fronted the BBC's flagship football highlights show since 1999, but was recently at the centre of social media speculation another presenter could be about to take over. Following the news that James Corden is leaving his US talk show role in 2023, many began to wonder whether he could succeed Gary as host of MOTD from next year onwards. While most Brits know James as an actor and comedy writer, he has fronted The Late, Late Show in America for the past seven years, as well as hosting the Brit Awards, Tonys and Grammys. He also presented the popular sports panel show A League Of Their Own between 2010 and 2020 on Sky. However, Gary has shut down the rumours on his official Twitter page, insisting he's going nowhere for the time being. 'Getting a number of texts from friends asking if I'm quitting @BBCMOTD after reports on Twitter of my possible successor,' he wrote on Saturday night 'So it's only fair I give you the bad news now: I'm afraid I still have 3 years to run on my contract, so you're stuck with me for a while.' For the past four years, Gary has been named as the BBC's top-earning on-screen talent, despite having recently accepted a pay cut of around PS400,000.

We witness the robust relationship between Kanye West and his late mother, Donda, who was undoubtedly his biggest fan, in the documentary Jeen-Yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy. We heard the gut-wrenching cries of George Floyd calling out for his mother moments before his death in 2020.  Black motherhood has often been centered in the analysis of the Black family -- and for Black men, the maternal connection is vital, political and liberating.

I think that's been pretty evident in the course of her journey,' said Sulaiman Rashid, a 20-year-old college student in Washington, DC, whose mother raised four kids. 'My siblings and I have different career paths, but we are all grounded in the desire to create change, and that stems from my mom's passion to help and to serve others and to aid in the betterment of the world.' I wanted to explore the relationships between sons and their mothers. In this series of portraits, I photographed families and asked the sons to share some perspectives of the role their mothers had in their lives. From guidance on love, career and education to artistic inspiration and global travel, we see an expansive view of the strong bonds between Black sons and their mothers.      Diane Redfern            Sons: Christopher and Charles Tarpley         My mother, commonly known as Lady D, is a resilient and confident mother. She has a jazzy personality and is a strong woman of faith. She raised my brother and I to become the gentlemen we are today. - Charles        My mother's favourite saying is 'I'm gonna tell you what God loves ... the truth.' This is what I admire about my mother the most, her love of God. She has such a strong will to never give up no matter how tough things may be raising twins. - Chris      Tamara Redfern           Sons: Yaseen Ellison and Mujahid Ellison      My mother has always been a source of light in my life. Across time and space - from my earliest memories in the US to years later and continents away - this has rung true. The continuum of joy and love surrounding my mother could not be summarised by a discrete moment. How would I describe my mother, who first showed me the magic and vibrancy of life? Who taught me firm confidence in my ability to grow, adapt, achieve and inspire? I realise I don't have to isolate any single experience to highlight who she is when everyone who encounters her is liberated by her grace and kindness, and when all spaces she walks through are automatically elevated by her presence. It is no wonder Allah says heaven lies at the feet of the mothers. I love you, Mom. - Yaseen    When I think of my mother, my thoughts often associate her with the moon. Her radiant, smiling face is akin to the light of the moon on a clear night sky. Her sound judgment and listening ear have served as a therapy to the many problems I've come to her with over the years. Her belief and willingness to lend a helping hand to me, unwavering, in times when I felt all was lost. Time after time, failure after failure, my mother has always been by my side. The best person to have around when sharing good news, as her pure, bona fide joy for you can be experienced by anyone who has interacted with her. The funny thing is my mother has taught me virtually everything I need to survive and thrive on my own, but hates it when I'm not around. There's no better feeling than being capable of being alone but still having someone who never wants you to be alone. She's my light and my guidance; my mother is my moon. I love you, Mom. - Mujahid       Aisha Hassan           Son: Bilal Hassan         Ummi is very special to me; she means the world to me. She is my friend, travel buddy and confidant. I love being around her. She raised me into the young man that I am today. She is generous, caring, loving and not afraid to speak her mind. She was literally my first teacher. I was homeschooled from kindergarten to sixth grade by her and my father, who has since passed away. Back then, we didn't have all of the home-schooling resources that exist today. Now, homeschooling is this big thing with programmes that you can do online. She created an amazing curriculum for us. She was extremely resourceful in making sure that we had an optimal learning experience. We did so much with very little. We had so much fun on our extended learning library trips. She is a genius. I could never repay her for how much she has poured into me. - Bilal                Jamilah Rashid  Son: Sulaiman Rashid         My mother is a force of nature. If she wants to get something done, it's getting done. I think that's been pretty evident in the course of her journey. My siblings and I have different career paths, but we are all grounded in the desire to create change, and that stems from my mom's passion to help and to serve others and to aid in the betterment of the world. I love her because she gave that to me. I can't describe all the ways and reasons why I love her. As I grow into a man, I hope that my need for her doesn't wane or fade. When I was younger, I needed her to read me bedtime stories, and what I need from her now is guidance in selecting a companion and partner. She did a really great job, and I'd be very blessed to find someone like her. I'm grateful to her every single day for who she is as a mother, wife and a person. - Sulaiman         Adama Delphine Fawundu         Sons: Amal Buford, Kofi Buford and Che Buford (not pictured)         My mom set the standard and laid the foundation. She's always been so driven and always accomplishes what she sets her mind to. There are so many roles that a mother can fulfil: a provider, a protector, a friend, an inspiration. She does it all. Some of my most fond memories are of us getting up really early and riding the subway to school. Even though it was the crowded subway, it felt like just us; it was so warm. We would have some of the best conversations. We would talk about anything and everything. We would read together; we would do math problems together. I love thinking about those times. It makes me nostalgic. You don't realise how important that is, and I don't ever want to take that for granted. It's never been a question as to whether my brothers and I were her priority. She would drop us off and then have to go work her own job. It's a job within a job. I'm older and I live on my own; I'm independent, but my mother is still my biggest inspiration. - Amal       My mother introduced me to so much. The knowledge and experiences that she imparted on me shattered the limitations that would otherwise be present in my life. It's the reason why my creativity flourishes. We've traveled together. She took me to Sierra Leone, New Orleans, Phoenix, so many places. When we travel, we have fun, but we also learn about the land, the monuments, the historical connections. Our travels showed me the beauty of different cultures and that there are many ways of living. I love my mother. She always supported me. - Kofi  Karen D. Taylor     Sons: Chenzira Taylor Lewis and Siyaka Taylor Lewis         I have always been enamoured by my mother's unadulterated focus and ability to create as an artist. It's always helped me to see her not only as a mum, but also as an artist and creative in her own right. And it's been inspiring to see her flourish throughout my life in her different creative identities. She always encouraged my autonomy and inquisitiveness and aided my creative spirit. Her determination demonstrated that my dreams and creative endeavours are attainable. -- Chenzira  I see my mother as a community pillar, a preservationist of Blackness and Black culture and Black excellence. She is a preserver of the relic, an educator, a nurturer, a policer of integrity. I love the uniqueness of who she is, her quirks, her silliness, her strength and intelligence. She is very New York to the core; she is an intellectual, a scholar with the grit of the jazz nightlife scene. Most definitely a music snob, jazz and blues head, creatively impulsive, loving, laid back and full of big laughs. At the core, she is serene. She is literally the perfect yin and yang of creativity and strong love. - Siyaka    ",
    "2280c5283cb3384927854781eebcde0b33a297e422fa9f6c53ee2bd3": "On January 22, 1973, the US Supreme Court affirmed in a 7-2 decision the legality of women's right to have an abortion under the 14th Amendment.  Today, about one in four pregnancy-capable people in the US have had an abortion, and the risk of complications from an in-clinic procedure is extremely low. But before it was guaranteed as a constitutional right, seeking an abortion was a harrowing, potentially life-threatening endeavour.   While some women saved up the cash and sometimes travelled hundreds of miles to find qualified medical providers willing to risk their livelihood by operating on patients, others settled for providers lacking the qualifications and skills to perform induced abortions. And even more desperate people attempted their own abortions.  The outcome of these back-alley procedures or at-home coat-hanger abortions was often devastating, leading to maternal death or lifelong injury. (Complications from unsafe abortions include infection, incomplete abortions, haemorrhaging, uterine perforation and damage to the genital tract or internal organs, according to the World Health Organisation.) Because these stories were so traumatic - and because the stigma surrounding abortion was even greater in those pre-Roe v. Wade years - many women remained silent about their experiences.  Now, as the US Supreme Court seems poised to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision, it's worth revisiting their stories to understand what abortion was like in the decades before it was legalised. HuffPost US recently spoke to eight people who shared experiences of relatives - great-grandmas, grandmas, mothers and aunts - who sought abortions in pre-Roe v. Wade America. Many were already mothers, struggling to conceptualise raising one more child in poverty or, in some cases, with an abusive spouse. In one story that differs from the rest, a reader shares how her great-grandma, the wife of a well-to-do dentist, was able to obtain a safe abortion in a doctor's office with little fuss; the story illustrates how white, middle-class and upper-class women have always had an easier time accessing safer abortion options. (As many have noted, women of colour will be disproportionately affected if Roe v. Wade is overturned.)  Below, read all eight stories, which have been edited lightly for clarity, style and length.  'My maternal grandparents married in 1934. By the time my mother was born, it was clear my grandpa was a monster. Violent and cruel, he beat my grandma with a metal lunchbox. When mom was just a few months old, he threw her against a wall. My grandmother fled. She discovered she was pregnant again. To induce an abortion, she drank a bottle of Lysol. You can Google 'Lysol abortion' and see ads from that time that suggested a woman could use Lysol to 'correct your mistake.' The ads are quite chilling, their meaning vague and without instructions. It took my grandma 29 hours to die in her parent's home; they were helpless to end the agony. Living in a logging village in winter, there was no hospital or way to travel to the city. My mother always felt responsible for her mother's so-called 'suicide,' as children do. Doing genealogy research, I uncovered the full story when my mother was in her late 60s, but her life was already written and the truth brought no comfort. I sometimes think I should never have done the research. There are four generations impacted by this one attempted abortion. We can never really know how lives would be different if she had lived. But I do know my mother's life was forged by that event, she was an orphan, hidden from her father, never knowing why she'd been abandoned.' - Chuck M., 62, from Washington state 'My mother was a 16-year-old in 1970 when she became pregnant as a result of sexual assault. She was living with my grandparents in Southern California, and abortion was not legal at that time. My grandparents were not in a position to get over the border into Mexico to have the procedure done, and they didn't have access to a safe place to have the procedure done, either. Rather than risking my mother in a back-alley abortion, my grandmother assisted my mother in inducing a miscarriage. My grandmother had my mother sit in steaming hot baths for hours. My mother ingested medications that were considered dangerous to a fetus. They did everything short of physically harming my mother, though my mother did tell me that she was so desperate to end the pregnancy that she considered throwing herself off a high platform or down the stairs. They managed to successfully induce a miscarriage, and my mother was taken to the local hospital to deal with the effects of the miscarriage and for a dilation and curettage. That worked, but her young body and mental health were not OK. Though my grandmother's and mother's intentions were to do something safer than a back-alley abortion, my mother was still at risk of potential harm from the various medications she took. And the foetus would also have been at risk for birth defects and other issues if the medications had not succeeded in a successful miscarriage. It was still dangerous. My mother told me once that Roe was the single most important law that passed in her lifetime. That she was relieved that other women and people with a uterus would not have to suffer the same circumstances she did. If she were alive today, she would be absolutely shattered.' - Sara from New York 'My aunt Judith was just 17 in 1964 when she became pregnant after being raped on a study date at a so-called friend's house. She was horrified to find out she was pregnant; she was on her way to college in the fall, and a baby wasn't in her plans yet. Her doctor suggested a girls home out of town where she could stay until the baby was born and then give it up for adoption; it was her only choice since abortion was illegal. Judith had tried all the old wives' tales, jumping backward a dozen times at dusk and even drinking a tea that made her deathly ill just to lose the pregnancy naturally, but nothing worked. A friend of hers, Arbie, who was two years older, had been in Judith's shoes and had taken care of her 'dilemma' herself. In that summer of 1964, Judith chose to use a metal coat hanger, thinking it would be over quickly and no one would ever know. Her end result was far more than she had ever anticipated, with excessive bleeding and infection that led to a partial hysterectomy and the inability to ever carry a child. She spent nearly a month in the hospital. Her mother found out and never looked at her the same, although she did keep [Judith's abortion attempt] from Judith's father, knowing he would have kicked her out and pulled her college tuition. The family was hush-hush about everything, given the era everything took place. Judith went on to graduate college top of her class to become the first female doctor of psychology in the family. From the outside looking in, her life was perfect: the house, her own office, nice car, all the material things one could ever hope to have, but she had developed a serious drinking problem and her life behind closed doors was, as she once said, 'exactly what you'd think hell on earth would be.' I was born in '72, her only niece at the time, and she doted over me constantly every chance she had. I never suspected anything was ever wrong, although I did always wonder why Auntie Judy had such sad eyes; it wasn't until puberty hit for me that she warned me of the dangers of having 'that time' and told me her story. She explained there were no real options in '64 but said that because of Roe v. Wade in '73, I would have more options than she had ever had. Her desire to be able to carry a child, to be the mother she had always dreamed of, haunted her every waking hour and her dreams, and she was never able to get away from it. In 1984, just a week shy of her 37th birthday, my Auntie Judy hung herself in her attic; the pain and anguish had finally won the battle. Her note was a short novel, telling her story. I was only 12 and was told I wasn't old enough to read it or understand it, but I didn't listen. I sneaked and read it, and now I can remember every word, and her pain, longing and anger still haunt me to this very day.' - AJ, 50, from Louisiana  'Like most kids raised by a single mother, I've always thought of my mom, Jan, as courageous, resilient and strong. Growing up, she commuted nearly two hours each day -- every day -- to work a low-paying job as a secretary so that my brother and I could have a better future. Despite all that she went through, my mom never gave up and ensured that my brother and I could get the best education and have more opportunities than she did. But it wasn't until I was in my 20s that I realised how truly incredible my mom is. One day, my mom shared that she was around my age when she had two abortions. This was 1968-69, when abortion was still illegal in the U.S. and my mom was 26 or 27 years old. My mom told me that she had her first abortion during this time while dating a much older man. The pregnancy was very unexpected, and because my mom was struggling to make ends meet and didn't have much support at all, she made the wrenching decision to abort the pregnancy. Because abortion was illegal in the States, the man found a doctor for her in Puerto Rico and agreed to pay for the procedure, so my mom went with my grandma to have it done. They traveled to San Juan and then traveled a bit outside of the city. My mom expected the procedure to be done with anaesthesia, but - horrifyingly - it wasn't. 'The abortion was done by a butcher and my mother heard me screaming,' my mom recalled. 'I didn't know that they weren't going to give me anaesthesia. It lasted for only 20 or 30 minutes, but it seemed like a lifetime. When we got back to the hotel in San Juan, I was in such pain. Then, when I was back in New York City in A&P Grocery a few days later, I noticed that I was bleeding -- haemorrhaging.' My grandma immediately called a gynaecologist and arranged to have my mom treated in the ER at Lenox Hill Hospital, where they didn't tell the doctors that the bleeding was caused by an abortion out of fear because the procedure was still illegal. My mom was lucky to survive.' - Jared Milrad, 38 'Today, the majority of women who seek a legal abortion are already mothers. Let me share a pre-Roe horror story about my Italian, Catholic grandmother Mary, whom I never had the blessing to know. Apparently, on her deathbed in 1943, Mary asked her sister-in-law Florence, who was childless, to take care of her only daughter, but the shameful secret had to be kept. My mom was forbidden to ask questions about her mother or her death. She learned the truth when she was in her 50s from me after years of research. I was in my 20s when I first began to put together the pieces of a story that just didn't make sense: a 34-year-old mother of three young children who is hemorrhaging but refuses to go to the hospital. Even the death certificate corroborates the secret. Cause of death: carcinoma of the cervix. But cervical cancer does not generally cause women to bleed to death. Then, one day in the mid-'70s, we were talking about the Roe decision, and Florence, the woman I knew as my grandmother, let it slip that she had to lend $250 (an enormity in 1943) to one of her brothers because someone needed an abortion. I was stunned; I finally connected the dots. In a typically large Italian Catholic family, Florence had many sisters but only two brothers. One of them, it turns out, was my biological grandfather. Grandma Mary already had three children she loved: two boys and the middle child, my mom Nancy. With an unemployed husband, a fourth child would plunge the family into poverty. So the decision was not made lightly, but something went horribly wrong. Mary was just 34 years old and was more afraid of the law (and the judgment of the Catholic church) than she was of dying and leaving her children motherless.' - Lori Bores from New York  'Great-Grandma Selma Rosenthal (born 1878) was a career woman. Graduating from college in 1901, she was homely and smart, two things that did not make her particularly attractive to suitors of the era. Knowing this, she focused on having a successful career. She was by all accounts very funny, with a wonderful voice and an active circle of friends. She had no expectation that marriage or family were in the cards for her, and she had made peace with that idea. That all changed when she met Sidney Rauh, a dentist from Cincinnati from a well-off family. It was the 1910s, and she was well into her 30s. Sidney was equally unattractive and clever, and a confirmed bachelor. He had no interest in marrying a girl for her looks but wanted to find someone he could love for her mind. When they met, it was love at first sight, and given their advanced ages, they decided to marry as soon as possible. Selma quickly became pregnant, only to miscarry the first Christmas they spent together as a married couple. Two daughters quickly followed in 1916 and 1919, but Selma was terribly sick with her second pregnancy and she barely survived childbirth. Her doctor told her, in no uncertain terms, that if she was to get pregnant again and attempt to see it to term, she would die. She promised she would be careful. A few years later, when she realised she was pregnant, she went to her doctor. The doctor advised her that she had to have an abortion. Sometime later, the doctor performed an abortion in his office, no fuss, no muss. But Selma was a well-off wife of a successful dentist with status in the community. It never occurred to her that what she was doing was illegal or in any way wrong. It was a decision between her, her doctor, and Sidney, and she did what was best for her family and health. Selma died in 1948 at the age of 62 of a heart attack, having spent time not just with her daughters, but also with her granddaughters, who were five and three at the time of her death. Great-Grandma was a suffragette and strived for women's rights. Women's rights and bodily autonomy were key issues in my family, but I suspect the story would not have been noteworthy had it not been for the fact that abortion became the issue it was later on. My mother and grandmother shared with me how hard things like birth control had been to get in their era, and my mother shared with me the fact that she got a (legal) abortion for family planning reasons. For us, it was just part of normal conversation.' - Kate, 50, from New York 'I was born in the 1960s and grew up in a very conservative Catholic family. Nonetheless, my traditional housewife mother was ardently pro-choice. She even took one of my friends to get an abortion in the 1980s because my friend couldn't tell her family she was pregnant.  Shortly after my paternal grandmother died, when I was a college freshman, my mother frankly told me during a conversation about choice, 'Your grandmother had a back-alley abortion and almost bled to death.'  My grandmother found herself - in the early 1940s before birth control or abortion were legal - pregnant and divorced from her second husband, who turned out to be horribly abusive. She decided to leave before he began abusing her three children from her first marriage. Like most women of her day, she had no college education or career to support herself and her children. And, like most women who get abortions, she could barely support the children she had. She ended up having to go live with her parents, who were Italian immigrants.  Faced with being twice divorced and pregnant, my grandmother sought an abortion. Because they were illegal, she had to trust a back-alley 'doctor,' who punctured her uterus in the process. She left the procedure, collapsed in the street from the blood loss, and had to be taken to the hospital. An emergency hysterectomy saved her life.  She was an amazing mother and grandmother, and although she died almost 40 years ago, I still become emotional when I think about what a loss I would have suffered had she died from that botched abortion. The rest of the family never knew. I am telling her story now in the same way that we disclosed our sexual trauma during the Me Too movement to educate others. Legal and safe abortion is critical to women's reproductive rights as American citizens, and we cannot allow them to expire.' - Stephanie Voltolin 'My great-grandmother died from a botched, illegal abortion in the mid-1930s in Chicago, leaving my grandmother (2 years old) and her sister (4 years old) without a mother. When my great-grandfather remarried, his new wife already had kids of her own and didn't want to take care of two more. My grandmother and her sister were thrown out of the house and bounced around to different aunts and uncles. For much of my grandmother's life, she was told that her mother died of a pregnancy complication due to an ectopic pregnancy. Later, when my grandma was a teenager, her aunt told her the truth: that her mother had died from a botched, illegal abortion. My grandmother shared her story with me in 2012 when I was 25. We were having an early lunch. I remember she asked me if I wanted a glass of wine, which was odd for her in the middle of the day. We were talking about something else entirely and she said, 'my mother died of a botched, illegal abortion,' almost out of the blue, and her story just unfurled from there. I honestly didn't think too much about what my grandmother shared. I didn't think her story was shocking or novel, maybe because abortion had been legal in all 50 states for my whole life. I assumed everyone else in our family knew, so I didn't think to say anything. A couple years later, I was catching up with my parents and one of them said, 'Did you know Great-Grandma Sally died from a botched illegal abortion?' That's when I realised my grandma was nervous when she shared her mother's cause of death with me. She was holding on to this family history and likely carrying with her the shame and stigma or the 'don't talk about it' attitude of her family. It was an 'aha' moment for me - a real understanding that likely everyone has a family abortion story, whether they know it or not. Now our family has a deep understanding that when abortion is legal, abortion is safe. And we know in the decades before Roe v. Wade was decided, people like my great-grandmother were desperate to receive the care they needed.' - Amy Handler, 35, from Oregon",

    "8704724119def6078b204391028c8c59c120e781c31b53417e274282": "Sinn Fein has made political history after emerging as the largest party in Northern Ireland. After years of lagging behind its rival the Democratic Unionist Party, with whom it shares power, the nationalist party has now emerged on top with the potential to change the political landscape in the Northern Ireland. Its position as the largest party means a poll on the reunification of Ireland is now far more likely. Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the IRA that favours Irish reunification, has won 27 seats which means numerically they now cannot be beaten by the DUP. The results mean that Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill -- who has served as deputy first minister from 2020 -- should be appointed as first minister, a post the DUP had held for two decades. Under Northern Ireland's power-sharing system, the jobs of first minister and deputy first minister are split between the biggest unionist party and the largest nationalist one. Both posts must be filled for a government to function. The post of first minister has the same constitutional weight as the deputy post, but the change to Sinn Fein represents a symbolic shift in Northern Irish politics and could lead to questions around Irish reunification intensifying. However, under the 1998 Good Friday agreement, it is up to the British government to call a referendum if they believe a 'yes' majority looks likely on both sides of the border. Opinion polls have consistently shown most voters in Northern Ireland favour the status quo. The DUP has already suggested it may not be willing to serve under a Sinn Fein first minister, a situation that would plunge Northern Ireland into further uncertainty and would almost certainly guarantee another election. O'Neill used her formal victory speech on Saturday afternoon to send a message to the DUP. She said that the electorate wanted politicians to get working on solving everyday issues, such as the healthcare waiting lists and the rising cost of living. 'And that's the reason why on Monday we must all turn up together,' O'Neill said. 'That's the reason why on Monday, there is an urgency to restore an Executive and start putting money back in people's pockets, to start to fix the health service. The people can't wait. 'I will lead my team to Stormont on Monday. The people have told us during the course of this election that they expect us to work together. The people are right.' A standout factor in the DUP's backsliding at this year's elections has largely been attributed to dissatisfaction with Brexit and the Northern Irish protocol, which has resulted in checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, disrupting trade. The arrangement was designed to maintain an open border between Northern Ireland and the republic, which remains a member of the EU.   It was considered essential to honour the peace process and to prevent the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland, but some unionists believe it creates a barrier with the rest of the UK and undermines their British identity.    The DUP has also said it will refuse to join a new government unless there are major changes to the post-Brexit border arrangements under the Northern Ireland Protocol. In February, the DUP's Paul Givan resigned as first minister in protest at the protocol, meaning O'Neill also automatically lost her post. Reflecting on his party's performance shortly after he was re-elected in Lagan Valley, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said one the 'key messages...is that unionism simply can't afford the divisions that exist'. 'The DUP is very much in the game at the moment,' he added. 'I have made it clear we need the government to take decisive action on the protocol. Words are not enough.'  Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis encouraged the parties to form an Executive 'as soon as possible'. He said: 'The people of Northern Ireland deserve a stable and accountable local government that delivers on the issues that matter most to them.  'The electorate delivered a number of messages on Thursday. They were clear that they want a fully functioning devolved government in Northern Ireland, they want the issues around the Protocol addressed, and that they want politics to work better.' Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Peter Kyle said his party could act as an 'honest broker'. Congratulating new assembly members, he said: 'It is healthy for Northern Ireland that parties from either community can nominate a first minister and shows the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement working. 'Unionism will still have a strong voice within powersharing and calls for progress on the remaining issues of the protocol have been heard and should not prevent a return to the executive. 'The Government must now prioritise practical solutions through negotiation with the EU and not chase headlines with empty threats.'",
    "a60a4f37961d9eee70f2ce9de1663852107c998e4ee7ac4d6d7c818a": "A 'support group' is being set up for Tory MPs after one of their colleagues quit after he was caught watching porn in the Commons. The party's chief whip has written to Conservative MPs offering them help following on from 'serious issues' raised in parliament. In an email, seen by HuffPost UK, Chris Heaton-Harris said they needed to do more to 'improve the culture' at Westminster. It comes after a number of female Tory MPs raised serious concerns about misogyny and sexism within their own party.  Heaton-Harris said he had asked MPs Amanda Solloway and Rebecca Harris to look at how they can 'better respond to any welfare issues'. He also revealed that foreign office minister Amanda Milling has been asked to set up a 'support group' for colleagues. The group will be made up of a 'cross-section of colleagues' dedicated to providing support and guidance on a range of matters, he said. The intervention comes just days after Tory Neil Parish resigned as an MP after admitting he watched pornography twice in the Commons. Two female colleagues claimed they had seen him looking at adult content on his phone while sitting near them. The concerns were raised during a heated meeting in which a string of female MPs complained to the whips about sexism and misogyny within the party. The scandal prompted senior Tory MP Caroline Nokes to say her party was institutionally sexist and that there was a culture of 'male entitlement' Heaton-Harris said the Conservatives had 'some of the best and most dedicated' MPs, but added: 'It has become apparent we need to do more to improve the culture we work in and ensure parliament is a welcome place for everyone.' The chief whip went on to encourage MPs to 'reach out' and said if anyone raised concerns they would remain 'private and confidential'. Five years on from the so-called 'pestminster' scandal, parliament was once again engulfed in allegations of misogyny, bullying and sleaze. A senior MP was accused of repeatedly licking the faces of male researchers in parliamentary bars. It was also alleged that a female Tory MP was sent an explicit photograph, known as a 'dick pic', by a male colleague and another MP has reportedly been repeatedly warned about his use of prostitutes. The allegations have led to calls for a major overhaul of parliament's culture.  It led to the Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle to call for a review of current working practices.",

Towards the end of last year, the three-piece announced that they would be taking a break from the group after 11 years together when their Confetti tour comes to an end. However, in an interview with The Sun, they made it clear that they didn't intend for their hiatus to be a permanent one, admitting they're already thinking about reunion plans. 'Honestly, we haven't even parted ways yet and we're already talking about when we're coming back!' Perrie Edwards told the newspaper. 'We're like, 'is two years away enough? Two and a bit years?'.' Jade Thirlwall agreed: 'You can't deny our relationship - whenever anyone comes to watch the show or sees us in interviews or on social media it's pretty obvious that we can't actually live without each other. 'We know how phenomenal we are together, so why would we never want to do that again? Change has to happen in life, you have to move on at some point and try new things, but it's such a comfort to know we have each other to come back to. 'We don't know how long this will be for but I'm already ready for that reunion!' The band members also said there wouldn't be any rivalries between them when they launch their solo endeavours, insisting their friendship is more important than solo success. 'We've all said we will let each other know when we're going to release so we don't end up clashing in the charts,' Perrie explained. 'We're rooting for each other, not competing against each other.' Leigh-Anne Pinnock added: 'We are so close and that's the thing. We're all going to be in communication about this the whole time.'  Little Mix were put together by the judges on The X Factor in 2011, after auditioning as four solo artists, and went on to win the show. In 2020, band member Jesy Nelson announced she was leaving the group, telling fans at the time that being part of Little Mix was taking its toll on her mental health. While all parties initially maintained that Jesy's exit from Little Mix was amicable, this appeared to have changed somewhat by the end of last year, when they admitted they were no longer in touch with one another amid speculation of a fall-out. Little Mix's final show on their Confetti tour will take place at the O2 Arena, London on 14 May, but will also be live-streamed so fans around the world can watch what promises to be an emotional farewell for the chart-topping band.",

The former Weakest Link host took over the reins of Countdown from departing presenter Nick Hewer last year, following his 10-year stint at the helm. Earlier this week, Anne announced that she would be leaving the Channel 4 gameshow later this year, claiming she'd already 'stayed longer than I signed up for'. In a new interview with The Telegraph, she spoke more in depth about the decision, admitting that while it was 'great fun and I loved it for a year', she had no desire to do another. 'I just thought: 'You don't have to do this. And maybe you've now done enough',' she told the newspaper. Asked whether this meant she was done with just Countdown or television in general, she said: 'Of TV. I think I've done it, actually. I thought it was a nice swansong. I suppose I am, yeah, retired.' Throughout Anne's stint on Countdown, she has been at the centre of speculation about a supposed rift with co-star Rachel Riley, though she has repeatedly dismissed this. Anne's replacement is yet to be announced, and while Richard Osman and Carol Vorderman have been named as potential successors in the media, both stars have downplayed this on their respective Twitter accounts. Announcing her exit earlier this week, Anne said: 'I've had a blast hosting this wonderful show. And I stayed longer than I signed up for. Now it is time for an older woman to take the reins.' The 77-year-old star added that she hopes to have changed people's perceptions on what older women are capable of, stating: 'I hope too I've encouraged TV bosses to realise that not all women at the wrong end of their seventies are in care homes playing bingo and watching conjuring tricks.'",

Jo Stevens said Labour were 'confident' no Covid rules had been broken when Starmer was pictured with a beer while campaigning in Durham last year. However, local police announced yesterday that they were launching a fresh investigation into whether he broke lockdown rules. Asked if Starmer should resign if he is found to have broken the law, Stevens told Times Radio: 'Well, I think if we get to that situation, which I think is extremely unlikely on the basis that Durham police have already investigated this complaint and found that no rules have been broken, I'm sure Keir will make a statement at that point, but I think that this is a non story, a kind of smear that's been going on to time with the local elections to try and hold up a Tory party that is so badly damaged by the behaviour of the prime minister.' The shadow Welsh secretary went on to insist that 'no breach' of the rules occurred and added: 'We're confident of that.' Durham Police announced they would launch an investigation into the so-called beergate row following 'significant new information'. The Labour leader is under pressure over footage of him drinking a beer and having a curry with colleagues in April 2021 while campaigning for the Hartlepool by-election. At the time of the gathering, non-essential retail and outdoor venues including pub gardens were open but social distancing rules, which included a ban on indoor mixing between households, remained in place. Boris Johnson has already been issued a fine by police for breaking his own lockdown laws. But Durham police have been asked by Conservative MP Richard Holden to reconsider their initial assessment that no offence was committed by Starmer. Starmer has said no rules were broken as it was just a short break for a meal during work. In a statement, the force said: 'Earlier this year, Durham Constabulary carried out an assessment as to whether Covid-19 regulations had been breached at a gathering in Durham City on April 30 2021. 'At that time, it was concluded that no offence had been established and therefore no further action would be taken. 'Following the receipt of significant new information over recent days, Durham Constabulary has reviewed that position and now, following the conclusion of the pre-election period, we can confirm that an investigation into potential breaches of Covid-19 regulations relating to this gathering is now being conducted.' Starmer said: 'As I've explained a number of times, we were working in the office, we stopped for something to eat. No party, no breach of the rules. 'The police obviously have got their job to do. We should let them get on with it but I'm confident no rules were broken.'",

On Friday evening, it was announced that Rose will follow in the footsteps of stars including Tom Hardy, Rege-Jean Page, Dolly Parton and Kate Middleton by appearing in the story corner. The EastEnders star will become the first person in history to sign a story on CBeebies, telling the tale of Can Bears Ski? using British Sign Language. Her segment will air on Sunday night, to mark the end of Deaf Awareness Week. Can Bears Ski? Centres around a young bear and his father on their journey into the discovery and management of deafness. The book draws on author Raymond Antrobus' experiences to show how isolating it can be for a deaf child in a hearing world.  Rose said: 'I am super excited to read my first CBeebies bedtime story in British Sign Language and it's even more wonderful to share a story written by a deaf writer. 'I hope deaf children enjoy the story and it inspires hearing children to want to learn BSL more.' During her appearance - which will be subtitled - Rose will speak aloud only at the beginning and end of the segment, to introduce her story and say good night to viewers. Last year, Rose made history as the first deaf contestant to compete on Strictly, going on to win the show with professional partner Giovanni Pernice. This weekend, Rose and Giovanni are in the running for the Must-See TV Moment award at the TV Baftas for their routine to Clean Bandit's Symphony, which included an emotional section performed in complete silence.",
    "426d531649ebc0165a8943bd740df86787a5b5dbd3965ef3551ddeaf": "Rachel Riley has admitted she's grown tired of having her relationship cited as an example of the so-called Strictly Come Dancing 'curse'. Over the years, Strictly has become synonymous with what the media refers to as the show's 'curse' which has seen several celebrity contestants' relationships ending during or after their time on the show, many of whom then end up getting together with their professional partners. The Countdown presenter competed on Strictly in 2013, and shortly after the show ended she split from her ex-husband, later announcing that she and her former dancer partner Pasha Kovalev were an item. Rachel and Pasha have now been married for almost two years, and have two children together. During an appearance on the podcast Dirty Mother Pukka, the Maths expert was asked when she first fell in love with Pasha, insisting it was long after their time on Strictly together. 'That wasn't until much later,' she explained, noting that 'at the time I did it I was married'. When asked for her feelings about the Strictly 'curse', Rachel continued: 'I mean I still get it, I'm never going to avoid it. 'But now it's like, you know, we've got two children. At what point can you just not call my children 'the Strictly curse'?' She added that her appearance on Strictly was now almost a decade ago, telling the host she 'only had to answer to myself and my family'. Last year, Rachel admitted that Strictly is something she now intentionally avoids, having undergone therapy for PTSD after her time on the show. 'I needed cognitive behavioural therapy after competing in 2013 and developed post-traumatic stress disorder,' she said. 'If I heard the theme music, I'd start reliving the experience. It was scary and unnerving, so my way of dealing with it is to avoid watching.' Rachel previously claimed she'd advised famous pals against taking part, and also knows others who 'have dropped out of it due to the mental pressures involved'.",
    "f08eec30ca28f2ba8fb5fc7f3a19a8d6f8917f574c39104343536764": "A cabinet minister today urged Tory MPs not to move against Boris Johnson following heavy local election losses. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi also insisted the prime minister remained an electoral asset to the Conservative Party. It comes after the Tories lost almost 500 seats and control of 11 councils in the local elections. Many Tory MPs considered the vote a referendum on Johnson's premiership and are now weighing up whether or not to move against him. In a message to Tory colleagues, Zahawi told Sky News: 'People don't like to vote for split parties, for teams that are divided. 'We are strongest when we are united, we've got a Queen's Speech next week where we will demonstrate to the nation that the second half of this parliament is all about dealing with repairing the economy, recovering from Covid, the backlog of the NHS and national security - here at home, safer streets - and, of course, abroad. All of these things we have a plan for. 'We are stronger when we are united and that would be my message to all my colleagues.' Pressed on whether Johnson was still an electoral asset for the party, Zahawi insisted: 'He is an asset, absolutely...If you look at the way that Boris cuts through in places like Nuneaton, places like Newcastle-under-Lyme, other parts of the country as well - Harrow in London.' The results are fuelling speculation over Johnson's leadership, with some MPs blaming the losses on the prime minister.  Tory MP Aaron Bell, a critic of the PM, said the issue of Johnson's leadership had to be 'brought to a head'. Bell, who has already submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson, told BBC Radio 4's Today: 'It's not really up to me, it's up to my colleagues and I'm sure when we get back to Westminster there will be a discussion about that. 'What I do think is it needs to be brought to a head sooner rather than later because I don't think we can continue having this hanging over the party for many more months to come, with the Metropolitan Police and Sue Gray and then the Privileges Committee.' The Newcastle-under-Lyme MP said it was a 'perfectly reasonable' position for colleagues to wait until the publication of senior official Gray's report on the alleged lockdown-busting parties in No.10 and Whitehall. However, he said they 'do need to bring this to a head, one way or another, so that we can draw a line under this'.  HuffPost UK has heard that staff working for some leadership hopefuls have been trying to 'tap-up' MPs for support for weeks.   One MP has also admitted they are a campaign manager-in-waiting for one hopeful.   Some MPs think any leadership challenge must take place in a 'window of opportunity' soon after the local election results are announced or Johnson will likely be taking them into the next general election.   However, it all depends on whether enough letters of no confidence have been submitted to chairman of the 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady.   One senior backbencher is said to be in 'full-on manoeuvres' as MPs across the party say they have been approached by his staff. Yesterday No.10 aides were told the prime minister was 'buoyant about the future' after the local elections, according to The Times. David Canzini, a senior aide to the PM, reportedly showed staff statistics from previous mid-term elections in 2000, 2004 and 2009 when the Tories had performed strongly only to do less well at subsequent elections and told them: 'The sky hasn't fallen in and we've got to keep going.'    Speaking on a visit to Ruislip, north-west London, Johnson said yesterday: 'It is mid-term. It's certainly a mixed set of results.     'We had a tough night in some parts of the country, but on the other hand, in other parts of the country you are still seeing Conservatives going forward and making quite remarkable gains in places that haven't voted Conservative for a long time, if ever.'

The TV presenter has been involved in Eurovision since 2018, when he took over as one of the BBC's commentators during the semi-final stages of the competition. Speaking ahead of this year's contest, Rylan told The Sun it's become something of a 'tradition' for him to take the UK's representative out on the town in whatever country Eurovision is being held in - though this hasn't always gone down so well with organisers. 'It is tradition that I always take the British act out, normally on the Wednesday or the Thursday,' he explained. 'And then the head of delegation always has a go at me because I take them out.' Rylan was quick to add that, even after his upcoming night out with UK singer Sam Ryder, he'll 'make sure Sam is alright by Saturday night'. This year's Eurovision Song Contest is being held in Turin, Italy following rock group Maneskin's victory in 2021. After the UK infamously fell to the bottom of the leaderboard last year with nul points, things are looking somewhat more promising this time around. Sam is competing with his self-penned song Space Man, which has received heavy rotation on both Radio 1 and Radio 2, and is among the top of the bookies' favourites to win.

We often hear how a flawless red carpet beauty look is down to good old hydration but now we have the details on why Kim's skin looked so lush - she used luxury skincare range Augustinus Bader before applying her makeup. We even know exactly what was applied to her skin (and how) as her longtime makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic revealed on Instagram the four Augustinus Bader products he used in her skincare prep to perfect Kim's Met Gala glow. First, he cleansed her face using Augustinus Bader's The Cream Cleansing Gel. Next, using a cotton pad, he applied The Essence  all over.  'Once that was absorbed, I applied The Cream  all over [her] skin,' he wrote. Since launching in 2018, Augustinus Bader has gained something of a cult status - at least among celebs - with famous fans on both sides of the pond.  Founded by biomedical scientist, Professor Augustinus Bader, the brand is informed by his work in regenerative stem cell medicine, including treating burns victims, leadin him to develop a range of active creams and serums.  Bader found that rapid regeneration of skin cells along with exfoliation improves the appearance and softness of ageing skin, and helps peel away dark spots and blemishes. Over time, it also improves acne and reduces wrinkles. Friends co-stars Courteney Cox and Jennifer Aniston, Britpack's Alexa Chung and Emma Corrin, pop royalty (Lizzo) and even actual royalty (Meghan Markle) have all used them - not to mention Hollywood types like Charlize Theron, Salma Hakek and Leonardo Dicaprio (yes, men can look after their skin, too). The brand has more than 70 industry awards and accolades and was voted top of WWD's Greatest Skincare Of All Time list. Victoria Beckham loves it so much she launched her own skincare line in partnership with Augustine Bader.  And even with a higher price tag, beauty editors agree the contents of these iconic blue bottles live up to the hype.  The Cream and The Rich Cream have been described as 'a miracle' and 'skincare magic', and reviewers say they leave their skin and complexion feeling soft, smooth, bouncy, dewy and hydrated.  The products may be simply named, but the science behind Augustinus Bader is anything but, with 30 years research behind its patented TFC8 formula.  And now having conquered facial creams, the brand is progressing into products for the body, hands and even haircare.

    "88e98cb913a9836b23200ca98aa231c40ad297ac040e9fc353a7d78d": "Every year on Mother's Day, I see people post old family photos on social media with captions praising mums for all the ways they prioritised their kids' needs at the expense of their own. 'You dropped whatever you were doing to help us.' 'You never bought anything for yourself so we could have whatever we wanted.' 'You made it to every one of my baseball games, no matter what else you had going on.' The posts are sweet, appreciative and written with the best of intentions. But they perpetuate this narrative that being a good mum means being a martyr.  'Sacrificing yourself as a person is still very much what's expected in this culture as a mother,' Georgetown University women's studies lecturer Elizabeth Velez, who co-teaches a class called Reading Motherhood tells HuffPost.  In recent years, there's been more acknowledgment that moms bear the brunt of domestic labour - both visible and invisible - whether or not they work outside the home. Mums are told they deserve self-care for their tireless efforts and they need to find time to practise it. But have these conversations actually lightened their load? Or have they just added more to their already very full plates?  People will point out that the martyr mentality is damaging and, in the next breath, glorify mums for attempting to 'do it all.' Many women still feel immense pressure, internal and external, to keep all the balls in the air at the expense of their own well-being.  The unyielding pressure of intensive othering  The expectation that women devote so much of their time and energy to raising kids really took off in the 1980s and 1990s -- the same time that more and more women were participating in the workforce. In 1996, sociologist Sharon Hays coined the term 'intensive mothering' to describe this parenting ideology, which is 'child-centered, expert-guided, emotionally absorbing, labor-intensive and financially expensive.'  Being a 'good mum' came to mean making everyday interactions with your child intellectually stimulating, filling your afternoons and weekends with enriching extracurricular activities and staying up to date on the latest parenting guidance.  Now, women were expected to excel in their careers while also expanding -- not reducing - their parenting responsibilities. According to a 2013 Pew Research survey, mums today actually spend more time with their kids than mothers did in the 1960s.  A 2018 nationally representative survey of more than 3,600 parents found that this intensive parenting style is what most parents, regardless of race and class, still aspire to today. Writer and activist Glennon Doyle aptly summed up how the expectations put on mums have greatly increased over the last few generations in her 2020 book Untamed. In one chapter, she spells out three hypothetical 'memos' women of different generations received when leaving the hospital with their babies. Her grandmother's memo would go as follows: 'Here is the baby. Take it home and let it grow. Let it speak when spoken to. Carry on with your lives.' Her mother's memo would say: 'Here is your baby. Take her home and then get together each day with your friends who also have these things. Drink Tab before four o'clock and wine coolers after. Smoke cigarettes and play cards. Lock the kids out of the house and let them in only to eat and sleep.' This generation's memo, however, is a lot more involved:  Here is your baby. This is the moment you have been waiting for your entire life: when the hole in your heart is filled and you finally become complete. If, after I put this child in your arms, you sense anything other than utter fulfillment, seek counseling immediately. After you hang up with the counselor, call a tutor. Since we have been speaking for three minutes, your child is already behind. Have you registered her for Mandarin classes yet? I see. Poor child. Listen closely: Parent is no longer a noun -- those days are done. Parent is now a verb, something you do ceaselessly. Think of the verb parent as synonymous with protect, shield, hover, deflect, fix, plan, and obsess. Parenting will require all of you; please parent with your mind, body, and soul. Parenting is your new religion, within which you will find salvation. This child is your savior. Convert or be damned. We will wait while you cancel all other life endeavors. Thank you.  And that's precisely why mums in today's generation feel so 'exhausted, neurotic, and guilty,' Doyle writes. Mummy martyrdom isn't good for mums - and it's not good for kids, either The cumulative effect of neglecting your own wants and needs for your kids' takes a toll and can leave you stressed, exhausted and resentful. According to Motherly's 2021 State of Motherhood survey, 93% of mothers say they feel burned out at least some of the time - with 16% reporting feeling that way all the time. A 2012 study from the University of Mary Washington found that women who endorsed intensive mothering beliefs were more likely to experience negative mental health outcomes like depression and lower life satisfaction.  Psychologist Becky Kennedy, known on the internet as Dr. Becky, tells HuffPost that societal messaging about maternal sacrifice sets up 'a very unsustainable vision around parenthood' - a concept she's discussed on her Instagram account and podcast 'Good Inside.'  We think our kids want us to sacrifice our needs for them when that's likely not the case, Kennedy says. When they see that we're afraid to do things for ourselves because they might tantrum or protest, they feel 'way too powerful' she says - likening it to a kid running into the cockpit of an airplane and trying to take over as pilot.  'Even if they're knocking down the cockpit door, it would terrify them if the pilot opened the door and let them take over,' Kennedy says. 'And so we need to realise as parents that taking care of our own needs is part of being a sturdy leader to your family. In that way, taking care of your own needs is really a way you're taking care of your kids.'  Consider also the message we're sending our kids when we neglect our own needs time and time again and praise other women for doing the same. As writer Christine Organ wrote for the Washington Post, painting mums as some kind of 'tireless, selfless superhuman' isn't good for anyone, 'least of all, our children.' 'I don't want my children to view me as some kind of self-sacrificing martyr; I want them to know that I loved them with all my heart and that they are part of a family - as well as a larger community - which means that their needs cannot always come first,' she wrote. What can we do to address this? Certainly, there are larger social issues that contribute to mums feeling like they have to do it all for their families. The US is one of few countries worldwide with no national paid parental leave. Good child care is often prohibitively expensive. The gender pay gap plays a role, too: because women generally earn less than their male partners, when one partner needs to step away from work to take care of the kids or a sick relative, it's often the woman - which only perpetuates the cycle. Then there's the fact that mums, whether they work outside the home or not, are often considered the primary parent. If there's an issue at school or the paediatrician's office has a question, whom do they call? Mum, of course.  'I don't know why in 2022 we still have this idea that women are better nurturers than men and that women are in the central caretaking role,' says Georgetown English professor Pamela Fox, who co-teaches the Reading Motherhood class with Velez. We can't reverse these deeply entrenched patterns overnight. But there are smaller things we can do within our own families to change the 'motherhood is martyrdom' narrative - and cut ourselves some slack in the process.  Tell your partner what you need from them, and then actually let them do it.  Ask for and accept help. Say you're not able to take on the brunt of the household and parenting duties anymore.  'We can't expect one person to do almost all of it,' Fox says. 'That's just totally unfair.'  Offloading some of your tasks onto your partner requires giving up control. Resist the urge to micromanage: Your partner may not do things the way you would, but they'll get done. And that's good enough. Say 'no' to others so you can 'yes' to yourself more.  As women, we've been socialized to be accommodating, which can make saying 'no' seem so difficult.  'We so often say 'yes' to favours, requests and unrealistic parenting expectations because we fear being accused of being rude, mean or - shock horror - selfish (one of the worst things you can call a woman in our culture that fetishises female self-sacrifice),' journalist Grace Jennings-Edquist wrote in an essay for The Guardian.  Practise tolerating other people's disappointment. When you start asserting your needs more, expect some pushback from your partner, kids or the other people in your life. For people-pleasing martyr types, that can be quite uncomfortable.  'There's this idea that, 'OK I'm going to stand up for what I need. I'm going to say I'm going to that exercise class.' And everyone around me is going to be happy for me so that will make it easier to go,' Kennedy says.  'No. When we stand up for what we need, we often do get pushback because sometimes it is an inconvenience to a partner to watch your kids while you're exercising.' In other words, we can't wait for other people to give us permission or tell us we deserve it. We just have to do it. And the more we do it, the easier it becomes.  Do more of what excites you outside of raising kids.  In an essay for The Week, A. Rochaun Meadows-Fernandez - a writer, activist and mother of two -- said that long before she had kids, she internalised the message that becoming a mom would mean giving up 'the enjoyable aspects of [her] life.' Eventually, she realised how unfair this expectation was and how unhappy it was making her, so she stopped putting her life on hold. 'I decided to detach myself from 'if only I weren't a parent' ways of thinking... And I started living differently,' Meadows-Fernandez wrote.  'Instead of staying home when I didn't have access to a sitter, I would bring my children with me to community meetings,' she continued. 'I stopped apologising when I had to shift work deadlines for my family. I volunteered for opportunities that interested me ... and made a career out of talking about the emotional stressors that accompanied Black motherhood. The more I did the more I realised that I didn't have to reduce my impact because I was a mother.'   Know that prioritising your needs will set a good example for your kids. Last May, I was eight months pregnant, writing a Mother's Day card to my own mum, whom I hadn't seen in over a year because of the pandemic. I thought about thanking her for the sacrifices - big and small - she had made for her kids over the years. But what stood out to me more were the things she chose not to sacrifice. She didn't breastfeed because she didn't want to. She continued working in a career she found rewarding. She went to the gym every morning because it helped energise her for the day ahead. She carved out time on Sunday nights to watch TV with my stepdad, no kids allowed. She led by example, showing me the importance of prioritising the things that make you *you* even after you have kids.  That Sunday, I woke up to a text from my mom that said: 'I'm glad I set that example for you guys because it's an important lesson. It's possible to be a great mom, daughter, sister, spouse, employee, manager, friend, but only if you make your physical, mental and spiritual well-being a priority.' And since becoming a mum myself, I've taken those words to heart.  This is part of a HuffPost Parents series called Enjoy the Ride. Read more here.",

Mike appeared in a string of Friends episodes between 1995 and 2001, playing Mr Treeger, the superintendent of Monica, Rachel, Joey and Chandler's apartment building. Treeger's most memorable appearance is in the episode The One With The Ballroom Dancing, in which Joey helps him perfect a dance routine in a bid to stop him evicting Rachel and Monica from the building. A post on Friends' official social media account said: 'The Friends family is mourning the loss of Mike Hagerty, our very own Mr. Treeger. Our thoughts are with his family, friends, colleagues, and fans. Here's to one last dance!' More recently, Mike landed a role in the HBO series Somebody Somewhere, which debuted in America earlier this year. He played Ed Miller, a farmer and the father of central character Sam, played by actor and comedian Bridget Everett. Bridget announced the news of Mike's death on Instagram on Friday, writing: 'With great sadness, the family of Michael G. Hagerty announced his death yesterday in Los Angeles.

Meanwhile, Liam holds steady as the most popular name for boys for the fifth straight year.  The SSA compiles the annual list based on the names parents in the US gave their babies born in the previous year. Although the top name rankings usually don't shift dramatically from year to year, there were a few interesting changes from 2020 to 2021.  James surpassed William for fourth spot. The only other change on the boys top 10 list is that Theodore made the ranking for the first time, coming in at number 10 and bumping Alexander down to number 13. As for the girls, all of the names in the top 10 are the same ones from 2020, but with a few changes in the order. Charlotte is now the third most popular name choice for girls, continuing a steady rise that began in the 1990s. Amelia also jumped up the list from number six to number four.

Boris GONE-son?: Tories in trouble Make no bones about it, the Conservative Party has lost more than 400 seats and that is not good. For all the talk of a mid-term protest vote against the governing party, the Tories had already been duffed-up the last time the councils were contested four years ago, so hundreds more councillors going on a like-for-like basis should not be glossed over. It's telling the gloss that Boris Johnson's outriders are painting with focuses on Labour's lack of gains, not its own deficit. But there was scathing criticism from within the party, including this damning tweet from ex-MP and former Theresa May adviser Gavin Barwell, who called it a 'wake up call'. But, with Johnson facing a leadership challenge if 53 Tory MPs demand a vote of no confidence, there was little sign they were more prepared to wield the axe. With most critics in Westminster keeping their heads down, it was left it to grassroots Tories to speak out.  John Mallinson, leader of Carlisle City Council, hit out after Labour took control of the new Cumberland authority which will replace it, saying: 'I think it is not just partygate, there is the integrity issue. Basically I just don't feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.' Johnson himself said it had been a 'mixed set of results' for the Tories. 'It is mid-term,' he said, sticking to the script. As the losses notched up, and edged towards 500 seats, a Labour Party spokesperson said: 'This is a shattering result for the Conservatives. 'Boris Johnson was on the ballot paper and the British public has rejected him. 'The question every decent Conservative will be asking themselves is how much further are they willing fall for a man who never fails to put his own interest above his councillors, his MPs, his party, and his country.' Next stop: tricky by-elections in Tiverton and Honiton and Wakefield.  2. Keir, there, everywhere: Labour's contrasting fortunes Labour's performance is open to interpretation, and interpret is what commentators have spent much of the last 12 hours doing. There were the headline grabbing wins in London - flagship Tory councils Wandsworth, Westminster and Barnet fell - and a majority on the newly-created council in Cumberland, which Labour leader Keir Starmer said showed his party could win anywhere. The traditional county-wide authority includes 'Workington Man', a voter demographic that gets pollsters very excited in terms of who might win a general election. There's also something happening for Labour on the coast - it took control of Southampton and Worthing - and the 'sea wall' appears to have entered the political lexicon, joining the 'red wall' and 'blue wall' stolen from US politics. But Labour has gained 252 councils seats - a reflection of the party not pocketing all the Conservative losses. The Tories were briefing how Labour has gone backwards in Sunderland, Tyneside, Hartlepool, Nuneaton, Sandwell and Amber Valley - former heartlands areas in the north and midlands that will be essential to getting back into power in Westminster. But it's progress. An analysis for the BBC by Professor Sir John Curtice calculated that if the whole country had been voting Labour would have gained 35% of the vote - five points ahead of the Tories on 30% - the party's biggest lead in local elections for a decade. Starmer, who is now facing a fresh 'beergate' investigation, proclaimed clear evidence of a Labour revival following its crushing defeat in the 2019 general election. 'This is a big turning point for us,' he told cheering supporters in Barnet. 'We've sent a message to the prime minister: Britain deserves better.' 3. Ravey Davey: The Lib Dem 'comeback' The toxicity surrounding the Liberal Democrats following five years of power sharing with the Conservatives, and hiking tuition fees, seems to be a fading memory. Ed Davey's party have compounded the success in recent Westminster by-elections by taking Hull council and the newly-created Somerset unitary authority. Other wins included Westmorland and Furness and dislodging the Tories in West Oxfordshire. The party has gained 189 seats, which in part explains why Labour's haul looks meagre. The Green Party, too, made substantial progress - gaining 81 councillors. The 'third party' success raises questions over splitting the 'progressive' vote three ways, and whether that would let the Tories back in at a general election by default. Expect to hear more talk about electoral pacts and 'lending' votes. 'What began as a tremor in Chesham and Amersham, became an earthquake in North Shropshire, and is now an almighty shockwave that will bring this Conservative government tumbling down,' Davey said. 4. One love: The SNP march on in Scotland Scotland is increasingly a one-party nation. The SNP claimed its 11th successive national victory, and the number of councillors it boasts has risen in every ballot since 2004. Perhaps more interesting was the race for second place. After years of decline, Labour has made gains and leap-frogged the Conservatives, whose strong performances under Ruth Davidson have gone in reverse now the former party leader in Scotland has left the stage. Improvements in Scotland - coupled with the Lib Dems nibbling away at the Tories in southern England - is part of a complicated route back to Westminster power for Labour. Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross described the results as 'very disappointing', adding that Johnson 'can't ignore the message' from voters. He said: 'The Conservatives lost Westminster Council last night, that's a council that even in the peak Labour years under Tony Blair the party held on to, so there's been a very strong message from the public to the prime minister and to the party.' The actual big story?: Sinn Fein closes in on history While the local elections in England, Scotland and Wales make for good sport for armchair analysts, they may not lead to anything of substance changing. But Northern Ireland's ballot could lead to a seismic shift for the whole of the United Kingdom. Sinn Fein is on the brink of political history if it emerges as the largest party in Northern Ireland following Assembly elections. After years of lagging behind its rival the Democratic Unionist Party, with whom it shares power, the nationalist party has now emerged on top with the potential to change the political landscape. With counting for the 90 Stormont seats continuing on Friday evening, the republican party had won 16 seats, well ahead of the Alliance on four and the DUP and UUP on three. Sinn Fein's position as the largest party would means a poll on the reunification of Ireland is far more likely - and the debate around Northern Ireland withdrawing from the United Kingdom of England, Scotland and Wales would intensify.",

Last summer, eventual winner Millie Court became an internet meme when she sat down at a keyboard for a musical recital during an Island talent show. Social media had a field day with the moment, superimposing Millie and her keyboard into a variety of unexpected scenes.  In the lead up to the eighth series of the ITV2 reality show this summer, she has now been immortalised in plasticine in a new teaser.  Two short promos taken from a full-length trailer have debuted, and see Love Island pitching itself as 'the OG of dating shows', ordering all the pretenders to stand down because 'Love Is Ours'. As they quash their TV rivals, fans then can see a shot of 'Millie' and her keyboard next to the pool as someone performs one of the series' trademark 'salmon' dives.  Both teasers will debut on TV during Saturday's Britain's Got Talent.  Love Island is expected to return to ITV2 in June, and will see the show move to a brand new villa. It has been based at the famous Spanish farmhouse in Sant Llorenc des Cardassar, Mallorca, since 2017, but this year's Islanders will have new premises to explore.  ITV has yet to confirm further details about the series, although married couple Laura Whitmore and Iain Stirling are expected to return to presenting and narrating duties respectively.  There had been speculation ITV was lining up replacements for Laura - with Strictly Come Dancing favourite AJ Odudu and former Islander Maura Higgins both linked to the role in the press - although reports have since suggested she will return for a third series.

The Conservatives lost councillors across the country as they dropped to third place behind Labour and the SNP. Allies of Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross blamed the partygate scandal at Westminster and Boris Johnson's unpopularity north of the border for the dramatic downturn in the party's fortunes. But others said Ross's decision to withdraw his call for the prime minister's resignation had damaged the Tories' electoral prospects. After the results in all 32 Scottish councils were in, the Conservatives saw their share of the vote slump to 19.6 per cent, nearly 6 points down on 2017, while they also lost 62 seats, leaving them with 215. The SNP have consolidated their place as Scotland's pre-eminent political party with 34.1 per cent and 454 seats, with Labour on 21.7 per cent and 281 seats. It was also a good night for the Lib Dems, who saw their number of seats increase by 20 to 87, while the Greens are up 15 seats to 34. Adam Tomkins, a former Scottish Conservative MSP, rejected suggestions from some within the party that the PM was to blame for the Tories' poor performance. He tweeted: 'I'm sorry but this is nonsense. Whatever today's results show Douglas Ross owns this, not Boris. It was Douglas who u-turned, Douglas who flipped, and Douglas who backed the PM. He and his team need to own the consequences, not pass the buck.' And Liz Smith, the Tories' finance spokesperson at Holyrood, said: 'Douglas will have to explain why he is defending him as prime minister but blaming him for the result. Douglas will have to explain the two sides of that coin.' But a supporter of Ross pointed out that the Tories were also suffering a bad night in England. They told HuffPost UK: 'I think it's unhelpful for people within the Scottish party to be pointing accusing fingers at Douglas when we've been losing councils like Wandsworth and Westminster. There may just be a wider narrative here.' Ian Blackford, the SNP's leader at Westminster, said voters in Scotland had 'sent a message' to Boris Johnson. He said: 'The important story from Scotland is the fact that the Tories are being rejected. 'Their vote is down and I think what really is important today is that the voters have sent a message to Boris Johnson. 'I think there's two things that count; one is of course the cost-of-living crisis - more needs to be done, and the other issue is partygate. 'I think people in Scotland have made it very clear that they want no more of this from Boris Johnson and his Conservatives.'",

The Labour leader has come under pressure since footage emerged of him drinking a beer with colleagues in April 2021 in Durham, during campaigning for the Hartlepool by-election. At the time of the gathering, non-essential retail and outdoor venues including pub gardens were open but social distancing rules, which included a ban on indoor mixing between households, remained in place. Boris Johnson has already been issued a fine by police for breaking his own lockdown laws. But Durham police have been asked by Conservative MP Richard Holden to reconsider their initial assessment that no offence was committed by Starmer. Starmer has said no rules were broken as it was just a short break for a meal during work. In a statement, the force said: 'Earlier this year, Durham Constabulary carried out an assessment as to whether Covid-19 regulations had been breached at a gathering in Durham City on April 30 2021. 'At that time, it was concluded that no offence had been established and therefore no further action would be taken. 'Following the receipt of significant new information over recent days, Durham Constabulary has reviewed that position and now, following the conclusion of the pre-election period, we can confirm that an investigation into potential breaches of Covid-19 regulations relating to this gathering is now being conducted.' Starmer said: 'As I've explained a number of times, we were working in the office, we stopped for something to eat. No party, no breach of the rules. 'The police obviously have got their job to do. We should let them get on with it but I'm confident no rules were broken.' Durham Police made the announcement as results of Thursday's local elections continued to roll in. Johnson admitted the Tories endured a 'tough night' after suffering a string of council losses but dismissed calls for him to quit. The prime minister said that he took full responsibility for the results as Labour strengthened its grip on London and the Liberal Democrats also made gains at the Conservatives' expense.",

Here's a breakdown of how this one area became such an essential part of the war. What's happening in Mariupol? The southern port city suffered from intense shelling and brutal attacks very early on in the Russian invasion and the pressure on Mariupol has only intensified since the Kremlin ordered its troops to focus on south-east Ukraine. While the Ukrainians held firm in Mariupol, the Russian forces gradually forced their way into the city.  The Russian president Vladimir Putin then declared victory in Mariupol last week, and now reportedly intends to make the desecrated city a key part of Russia's national holiday celebrations on Monday - but there's an obstacle. There is still a small body of resistance in Azovstal steel plant in the city which is facing intense and continuous attacks from Russian troops. It has evolved into a conflict so fierce it has been compared to the battle of Stalingrad from World War 2, where the Nazis put pressure on hiding Soviet forces. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy also told the UK foreign policy think tank Chatham House that Russia's treatment of Mariupol is 'an example of torture and starvation used as a weapon of war'. 'This inhumanity and cruelty is how the Russia military treats people,' he added. 'Death is not caused by war. This is not a military event. This is torturing to death. This is terrorism and hatred.' What's going on inside Azovstal? The UN secretary general described the steel plant as a series of 'hellscapes' now, due to the repeated bombardment from the Russian forces. The four-mile steel mill, built on the coast in the 1930s, has tunnels built deep underground and bunkers said to protect against even a nuclear blast. The network is so sophisticated it is currently housing around 2,000 Ukrainian fighters and approximately 200 civilians. The UN launched its third rescue mission to 'receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell...and take them back to safety' on Friday. The UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross also claim to have already helped almost 500 civilians flee during their two previous operations in the past week. Around 50 people - including the wives of soldiers currently inside Azovstal - are reportedly trying to negotiate with the Russian military for the release of the Ukrainian soldiers also trapped inside, but to no avail. Why is Russia bombing the steel plant? The Russian troops have not tried to infiltrate the mill because they will be putting themselves in jeopardy, as the Ukrainians hiding within would have the advantage. Instead, Putin called for his forces to besiege the plant. Large bombs are being dropped on the property, but it's unclear if the troops have yet managed to cut off all access to food, water and ammunition. The Ministry of Defence explained in its daily Twitter briefing: 'The renewed effort by Russia to secure Azovstal and complete the capture of Mariupol is likely linked to the upcoming May 9 Victory Day commemorations and Putin's desire to have a symbolic success in Ukraine. 'This effort has come at personnel, equipment and munitions cost to Russia. 'Whilst Ukrainian resistance continues to Azovstal, Russian losses will continue to build and frustrate their operational plans in southern Donbas.' Why is there extra pressure on Russia? Putin is preparing for Victory Day, the annual holiday in Russia of the 1945 defeat of the Nazis. As the Russia president is known to value symbolism and patriotism, he is expected to up the ante and consolidate his minimal victories for the occasion - although the Kremlin has denied that Putin will make any grand declarations of war. Russia is also becoming increasingly reliant on domestic support, because it is becoming so isolated from the international community due to its unprovoked, barbaric attack on Ukraine. Amnesty International has said there is evidence Russian troops have committed war crimes, including 'reckless shootings and torture' outside the capital of Kyiv, although Moscow denies it is responsible for any such crimes. Donatella Rovera, Amnesty's senior crisis response adviser, said: 'These are not isolated incidents. These are very much part of a pattern wherever Russian forces were in control of a town or a village.' Meanwhile, there have been reports of Russians fleeing the country due to the war, undermining support Putin is reliant on back home. Journalist Alec Luhn tweeted that around 3.8 million people - 'most of the pro-Western, opposition-minded folks' - fled Russia during the first quarter of the year. However, he suggested this could even work in Putin's favour, as he added: 'Don't hold your breath for a revolution.' ",

The brand has teamed up with model and body positivity advocate Charli Howard for a collection named 'Sorry not sorry: A celebration of confidence with Charli Howard'. The range includes a leopard print plunge swimsuit, a hot pink one shouldered bikini, and a white plunge swimsuit with cut-outs. In a video promoting the range, Howard says: 'I'm done with the pressure of other people's expectations. This summer I'm celebrating everything that makes me, me.' 'I'm loving the skin I'm in... own that beautiful body. Empower yourself and wear the bikini you want. Love every fold, every dimple, every curve. 'Forget beauty standards. We look damn good.' Howard, 31, has spoken up widely about body issues and in 2018 published her first book, Misfit, which explained how her experiences of eating disorders and anxiety directly led to her becoming a model and advocate. However, not everyone sees the collaboration from River Island as a step in the right direction. Social media users have been pointing out the mixed messaging of asking shoppers to 'forget beauty standards' when the campaign features a mid-sized model and the swimwear being sold doesn't cater to shoppers above a size 18. Influencer and writer Stephanie Yeboah aired her frustrations in a Twitter thread about the new campaign, which she says represents the complete opposite of body positivity.  Yeboah, who is the author of Fattily Ever After: A Black Fat Girl's Guide to Living Life Unapologetically, went on to say: 'It's so tiring as a plus-size content creator who works within the body image sector to constantly see brands use the body positivity movement to further push this mid-size trend, whilst leaving out the bodies that need it the most.' It's those bodies that are 'most marginalised' and any campaign that excludes them should not frame itself around body positivity, self-love or confidence, she added. Yeboah, 33, also highlighted the role of women of colour as pioneers of the body positivity movement and called for better allyship from mid-sized models. The plus-sized influencer said she had also worked with River Island in the past, but felt duty bound to call out this behaviour as a 'huge misstep' from the brand. As well as the language of the campaign being at odds with the casting of Howard as a mid-size model, Yeboah took issue with the swimwear only being available in size 6 to 18 - and she wasn't the only one. Several influencers have called out the brand for inviting plus-sized guests to the launch of the line, 'knowing' they wouldn't be able to wear the pieces.

Speaking on Friday morning, the Lib Dem leader said the victories were a 'turning point' that proved the party was on course to pick up MPs at the next general election. It was, Davey said, 'an almighty shockwave that will bring this Conservative government tumbling down'. The party was all but wiped out in Westminster in 2015, after it went into coalition with the Conservatives, when it lost 49 of its 57 MPs. It currently has 13. In the south west, an area of the country that used to be a Lib Dem stronghold, the party seized control of Somerset council, which has been run by the Conservatives since 2009. The victory is huge a boost to the Lib Dems ahead of the Tiverton and Honiton by-election, triggered by the resignation of Tory MP Neil Parish, soon to take place in neighbouring Devon. Lib Dems are hoping to repeat their stunning recent by-election successes in Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire, which saw huge swings against the Conservatives. Davey will also be eyeing up the Somerset seat of Somerton and Frome, where the incumbent MP David Warburton has had the Tory whip suspended following allegations of sexual harassment and cocaine use. In West Oxfordshire, David Cameron's backyard, the Tories lost control of the council for the first time in 22 years after the Lib Dems picked up eight of the 16 seats available.  While in Wokingham, home to veteran Tory MP John Redwood, the Lib Dems gained five seats pushing the council into no overall control. The Lib Dems gained a further nine seats in Richmond-upon-Thames, where they took control from the Conservatives in 2018. And in Wimbledon, the Tories were knocked into third by the Lib Dems on Merton Council. In Eastleigh, on the south coast, the party won all but one seat, despite Boris Johnson having campaigned there earlier this week. Beyond the south, a highlight for the party was also winning control of Hull. Labour's outgoing council leader in the city, Daren Hale, blamed the defeat on the collapse of the Tory vote. In Cheadle, a key target for the Lib Dems in Westminster elections, the party picked up two of the available three council seats. Just as Labour is hoping to win back the so-called Red Wall seats in the north, the Lib Dems are targeting what they have dubbed the Tory 'Blue Wall' in the south. Layla Moran, the Lib Dem MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, said the results 'across the country' showed people were 'putting their trust in the Lib Dems again' 'Not just in no-longer-true-blue Surrey and Oxfordshire but also in Northern Labour strongholds like Hull, people are turning to our party as an antidote to complacency and incompetence,' she told HuffPost UK. 'It's been a good day, but the bigger picture is how this tallies with our Westminster by-election wins last year and the number of close seconds that we can convert in the future. The Lib Dems definitely have a spring in our step today.' But Tory MP Bim Afolami said much of the Lib Dem vote was a 'protest' against a mid-term government rather than an indication of how the next election would go. 'A lot of people have told me they want to protest,' he told Sky News. A surge in the Lib Dem vote in the south will worry many Tory MPs ahead of the general election, not least deputy prime minister Dominic Raab, who only holds his Esher and Walton seat in Surrey by just 2,743 votes. The Tories have complained about a secret pact between Labour and the Lib Dems to maximise Conservative pain in marginals, something denied by both opposition parties. Even if Labour is unable to win back all its old northern seats at the next election, a substantial squeeze of the Tories in the south by the Lib Dems could put the Tory majority in jeopardy.  While there might not be a formal alliance, Sarah Olney, the Lib Dem MP for Richmond Park, said it was 'probably fair' to say in England her party was focussing efforts on the south. 'A lot of our targets at the next election are Tory seats,' she told the BBC. 'Those parts of the country are definitely parts of the country we are interested in.' Previous Lib Dem hopes of a revival in fortunes have not come to pass however. At the 2019 election then-leader Jo Swinson said it was a realistic possibility she could become prime minister.

Omicron caused widespread alarm when it first emerged towards the end of 2021, and pushed the government to roll out the booster vaccine programme quickly. The highly-transmissible variant swept through the UK at speed and quickly became the dominant strain. But, it was soon found to be less severe than Delta as the risk of death from Omicron 67% lower. Now new data suggests Omicron may also be less likely to cause long Covid for those adults who have been double-jabbed - but the situation changes again if you've received three jabs. What is long Covid? Long Covid is when a person who tested positive for the virus has symptoms persisting for longer than four weeks after the first initial infection, which cannot be explained by something else.  This is usually fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of smell and difficulty concentrating. It mostly occurs to people aged between 35 and 49 (particularly women) as well as those living in more depriving areas, working in social care, education or health care, with other health conditions or disabilities.  Approximately 1.8 million people in the UK are believed to be experiencing long Covid symptoms, according to data collected in the month leading up to April 3. That is a 6% increase from the previous month, and the highest number recorded so far throughout the pandemic. Around two-thirds of the people who believe they have long Covid say it has affected their day-to-day activities. So, how could the double-vaccinated be affected? According to the latest stats from the Office for National Statistics, double-vaccinated adults infected with Omicron BA.1 (the first sub-variant) were 50% less likely to report having long Covid four to eight weeks after infection. The risk of developing long Covid up to two months after an initial infection of Delta was 15.9%. This dropped to 8.7% for infections linked to Omicron's BA.1. What if you've received three Covid vaccines? The likelihood of getting long Covid changes when looking at the data for those who have been triple-jabbed. ONS found there is no change in the risk of developing long Covid between first infections with Delta and Omicron among the triple-vaccinated.  Is there a difference between the Omicron sub-variants? Yes - when it comes to the two Omicron strains, BA.1 and BA.2, the so-called 'stealth variant' the chances of developing long Covid change again. The stats suggest the odds of triple-jabbed adults reporting long Covid symptoms during that same period were 22% high with the Omicron stealth variant than BA.1. ONS has pointed out that for Omicron BA.1, around 7.8% self-reported experiencing long Covid. That compares to 9.3% with the stealth sub-variant. However, the data did not reveal what kind of long Covid risk there is for the new sub-variant, which is a combination of BA.1 and BA.2 and dubbed Omicron XE.  Experts are still learning about Covid-19. The information in this story is what was known or available at the time of publication, but guidance could change as scientists discover more about the virus.

The party is on course to lose around 300 seats in England as Labour, the Lib Dems and Greens all made gains at the Conservatives' expense. John Mallinson, the Conservative leader of Carlisle City Council, said Tory MPs should try to oust Boris Johnson after Labour picked up control of the new Cumberland authority. The Tories lost 14 seats on the council in north west England, while Labour gained 12 and took overall control. Mallinson said: 'I think it is not just partygate, there is the integrity issue. Basically I just don't feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.' Asked if he thought Conservative MPs should oust the PM, Mallinson said: 'That would be my preference, yes.' Meanwhile, Tory MP David Simmonds - whose Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner seat neighbour the PM's - said the issue of Johnson's personal conduct 'needs to be addressed'. Asked about those blaming him for the party's poor performance, the prime minister said: 'The big lesson from this is that this is a message from voters that what they want us to do above all - one, two and three - is focus on the big issues that matter to them, taking the country forward, making sure we fix the post-Covid aftershock, get us all through the economic aftershocks in the way we got through Covid, fix the energy supply issues, that's where the inflationary spike is coming, and keep going with our agenda of high wage, high skill jobs.' The Tories are also braced for a disappointing set of results in Scotland, where party figures are also blaming the PM's personal unpopularity for the decline in their fortunes. Early results indicated that the Conservatives are set to lose many councillors and slip behind Labour into third place north of the border.",

The cast of the hit Netflix reality show were brought together for a sit-down interview with Queer Eye's Tan France, following the dramatic events of the fifth season.  The reunion show dropped on Netflix on Friday, and saw Jason pressed on whether his and Chrishell's relationship was a 'showmance'.  'I hesitate to answer that question because I don't want to give any credence... it's a stupid question to me,' he said.  'I don't feel the need to explain to people,' he continued as he became emotional.  'There's a lot of sadness and loss. I think watching the show made it more difficult - it brought it back up. 'It's been a few months, but I'm still just going through stuff. I think there was a lot of love between us and there still is. I still care about her very much. This has been a very difficult break-up.' Chrishell was also seen wiping away tears as he spoke. The season five finale saw the couple - who confirmed their relationship in a post on Instagram last summer - split after Jason decided he did not want to have children.  During the reunion, Chrishell confirmed she has since moved on from Jason, revealing she is in a new relationship.  Reports earlier this week suggested she was dating non-binary rapper G Flip, which she confirmed to host Tan France.  'You don't get to choose when you meet someone in their life. Recently I met someone who is in a different place in their life as well,' she said.  'I've been spending a lot of time with someone who is very important to me, they're called G Flip, they're non-binary so they go by they/them.' Chrishell added: 'They're an extremely talented musician and it all started because I was going to be in their video.' Jason also gave the couple his best wishes, telling his ex: 'They seem like a bad ass for one and seeing [Chrishell] smile the last couple of minutes makes me very happy. I'm proud of you.'

    "733cc4b1b799894ae2cb9793fb487ff1d4984461b924dc065ca7ee5c": "It's totally normal to put on weight during a pandemic that closed gyms, made it illegal to leave your neighbourhood, and restricted us to the house.  But research shows that women have been more prone to weight gain during this time than men. That's because much of the responsibilities of the home, plus caring responsibilities, fell on women, leading many to stress-eat. With women more likely to bear the brunt of housework and homeschooling, on top of the demands of working in their professional lives, and the emotional labour of maintaining both worlds, their eating habits changed. Meanwhile, men experienced less disruption during the pandemic, despite also working from home, showed research from Leicester University. The study analysed data on 938,000 adults to analyse the changes in Britain's social habits during lockdowns. They found that women were 44% more likely to go from being a regular weight to overweight or obese, with 13% of women making the jump, while 9% of men did the same. Young adults also saw similar results, being twice as likely as their older counterparts to see their weight go up. But it any wonder that this is the case for women?  As well as the gender pay gap, women have also been financially hit during the pandemic.  According to research by the campaign group Pregnant then Screwed, almost half (46%) of working mothers made redundant believe a lack of childcare provision played a role in their redundancy. Meanwhile, 65% of mothers who were furloughed say a lack of childcare was the reason.  'There is mounting evidence showing that women have suffered huge financial penalties largely because of caring responsibilities,' Professor Dr Shumonta Quaderi, a sociologist at the London School of Economics previously told HuffPost.    'Women are losing their jobs at four times the rate of men; women especially in the lowest socioeconomic groups were more likely to be furloughed, women have been forced to cut their working hours and scale back their careers. 'So, when people say the pandemic has set back the cause of gender equality 'to the 1950s' we should all take this very, very seriously.' Healthy eating costs a lot of money, so with women earning less, in precarious work, and less likely to be in senior positions, it's not too shocking that they may opt for cheaper, more unhealthy food.   There's also gendered differences in the home. Where men might 'carry on' during lockdowns, women pick up the slack (ergo, emotional labour). Professor Thomas Yates, from Leicester University, said: 'I suspect lockdown had a differential impact on many women's lives compared to men. Men pretty much carried on as they were, they just worked from home instead. Whereas those school runs, supermarket shops or things that are potentially getting women out of the house more often suddenly stopped. 'And then you have to deal with homeschooling kids and a very different way of living, which was probably quite stressful. So not only was it reducing activity levels and changing diet, stress and mental health problems are probably playing into that as well.' All these factors has had an impact on women's mental health, which can affect body image, added Dr Yates. So it's totally normal that one might reach for comfort food. And we shouldn't feel bad for it (it's the first pandemic for most of us, after all). ",

The stunt for AGT: Extreme was supposed to see the escapologist free himself and fall underneath two cars before they collided, but the vehicles were released too early and he fell 30ft to the ground, missing the safety airbag below. Appearing on Friday's Lorraine alongside his fiancee, Sherlock star Amanda Abbington, Jonathan opened up about the accident which has left him in a wheelchair. 'I'm not down about it. I'm doing as well as I can be,' Jonathan said.  'It was pretty gnarly. It sounds very dramatic sitting here but I nearly died... I saved my life because I fell upside down, head first to the ground but I didn't hit my head.' Jonathan described the emotional moment he told Amanda following the horrific accident, that she could end their relationship. 'I did say, you have a get out of jail free card - if you want to walk away, then I completely understand and she told me not to be so stupid and that was that,' he said. Amanda added: 'We are closer and tighter than ever - every day is a joy... Life's too short - that's what I've realised through all of this. Just be in the moment. 'He's a total inspiration to me. He's an idiot - but I'm a wally so it's fine,' she joked. The couple also talked about their upcoming wedding later this year after deciding to get engaged 'within half an hour' of first meeting.  Earlier this week, Amanda detailed the extent of Jonathan's injuries. 'He fell 30 feet and lost a kidney, broke both shoulder blades, shattered both legs,' she told Jay Rayner on the Out To Lunch podcast. 'Third degree burns, broke his spine, severed his spinal cord and nearly died. And then on the operating table, he nearly died again. 'He's just been in rehab since October... He's paralysed now, he's in a wheelchair. Unless there's a kind of stem cell surgery or that thing that Elon Musk is designing with the little chip, he'll be like that [forever].'

The Labour leader needed to show that he was making sufficient progress to prove to his party that we was on course to lead them to victory at the next general election. With a significant chunk of the results now in, it's pretty clear that while Labour have firmly established itself as the natural party of government in London, that's certainly not the case in other parts of the country. Senior party figures were, naturally, keen to highlight the night's successes, such as the victories in true blue Westminster and Wandsworth, as well as the impressive win on the new Cumberland Council. 'It's good, solid progress, especially when you consider we were absolutely smashed in 2019,' one shadow cabinet member told HuffPost UK. 'We're set up now to go after the Tories in the seats they still hold in inner London, and we've stemmed the tide in the Red Wall. We're also hoping to be second in Scotland, which obviously isn't where we want to be, but again it's progress on where we've been in the recent past.' But others were also left underwhelmed by the party's showing in the Midlands and north of England, where they will have to make major gains to win the next election.  Indeed, polling expert Professor John Curtice pointed out that the party's support in the Red Wall areas they lost to the Tories at the last general election is actually down on 2018, when the council seats there were last contested. 'For a party that's looking to make progress ... this wasn't quite the degree of progress that they might have anticipated,' he told the BBC. So how might Starmer respond to the message sent out by the electorate last night? One senior Labour figure said: 'I suspect that the internal response will be that this shows why Labour needs to target its entire strategy even more narrowly on 45 to 65-year-old Tory-voting men in Red Wall seats.' Overall, Starmer is likely to be quietly satisfied with his night's work. But with many in the party still yet to be convinced by his election-winning qualities, it's fair to say that the jury is still out on whether he's the man to lead Labour back to government.",
    "028bd85055856bafe483d7ce2147f0bcf5d23615374fdc57f59df67f": "Amber Heard continued to describe the violence she says she endured at the hands of ex-husband Johnny Depp as she testified for a second day on Thursday, sharing her side of the incident where the Pirates Of The Caribbean star said Heard threw a glass bottle at him, severing his fingertip.  Both actors described an ugly scene of violence at a secluded rental home in Australia where Depp had been filming a movie -- but their versions of what transpired differed dramatically. Heard said multiple times that evening in March 2015 was 'terrifying,' describing it as the most scared she'd ever felt. At the height of the violence, Heard said, Depp allegedly penetrated her with a bottle repeatedly, putting pressure on her pubic bone. When he stopped, she said, she was afraid to move because she didn't know if the bottle was broken. She was bleeding, and went to the bathroom to throw up. 'I can't believe I have to do this,' she testified, while her attorney apologised for asking her to recount the alleged experience. 'Johnny had the bottle inside of me,' she said. According to Heard, the incident began after Depp started drinking and took an unknown quantity of the party drug MDMA. The pair were married at this point in their relationship -- they divorced in 2016 -- but had not seen each other in weeks due to their respective work schedules.  She said that when he shoved her, she shoved back.  'Do you want to go, little girl?' Depp asked, in Heard's telling.  Depp then allegedly began striking Heard, at one point throwing her onto a pingpong table that collapsed before starting to hit her again. At another point, Heard said she grabbed an empty bottle of alcohol Depp was waving at her tauntingly, and smashed it onto the tile floor, breaking it.  'It was like a lightbulb switch went off. He starts screaming. I don't know if he backhanded me or hit me normally, I don't really recall, but I remember it sent me down to the ground,' Heard said, crying. 'I remember by the time I picked myself off the floor, I stand up, he's got a bottle in his hand. He threw it at me. It missed, thankfully, but I kind of pulled myself back ... at some point, he had a broken bottle up against my face, neck area, by my jawline. He told me he'd carve up my face,' she testified.  'I honestly don't remember if I threw anything in his direction. I don't think I did,' Heard said. 'I just remember him having me by the nightgown. I remember him flailing me, throwing me around, I'm flailing. This was after there were some bottles broken on the floor. This was after -- again, forgive me, I wish I could remember the sequence, but it's flashes -- he's throwing these bottles at me.'  In Depp's telling, he never hit Heard or any other woman. Instead, Heard chucked a broken bottle at him inside the house in Australia, and it sliced off the tip of one finger. At one point during his dayslong testimony, Depp stood up and spread his fingers before the courtroom, displaying the one that had been repaired by doctors.  The manager of the rental house testified last month about finding Depp's fingertip in a bloody paper towel.  But Heard said she was simply trying to get away from Depp and protect herself.  'At some point, I'm up against a wall and he's screaming at me that he fucking hates me. That I ruined his life,' Heard testified. At another, she said, Depp ripped off her nightgown, leaving her naked.  After the attack, Heard said she found the house had been trashed, with empty bags of what she said was cocaine scattered around. Images shown in court showed splotches of blood on the floor, along with messages scrawled in paint and what Heard said was blood from Depp's injured finger on the walls, a couch, a lampshade and other furniture. Mashed potatoes were smeared 'all over' the walls, along with other foods, including pieces of raw steak that had been wrapped in the fragments of her nightgown, according to Heard. 'It was clear he was just out of his mind. He wrote on the back of a pillow in blood,' Heard said. 'It looked like he ran out of blood ... it wasn't bleeding enough, and he went and got paint, and it became paint and blood.'  Depp has been open about his struggles with alcohol and drug addiction in the past, but maintains that he never abused his ex-wife -- rather, he says he was the one who was abused. He said on the stand that her abuse claims were 'heinous' and 'not based in any species of truth.' Both actors' testimony came as part of Depp's defamation lawsuit against Heard over a 2018 Washington Post editorial she wrote with lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, describing her as a domestic violence survivor.  Earlier in the day, Heard built on testimony she gave on Wednesday alleging that the people who helped manage Depp's career ignored his bad behaviour and helped cover it up by, for example, changing him out of soiled clothes after he'd passed out. On Thursday, she told of an incident on a private plane in 2014 where Depp confronted her about steamy scenes she'd filmed with actor James Franco for the film The Adderall Diaries, which debuted in 2015.  'He called me a slut,' she said. Heard had described many instances throughout her testimony where Depp accused her of cheating on him with other people.  On the plane, she said that she tried distancing herself from Depp, who began 'throwing things ... ice cubes, utensils.' Then, she alleged, he slapped her in the face while a friend of the couple sat nearby. People who worked for Depp were also aboard, she said. When Heard got up, Depp kicked her in the back, causing her to fall to the floor of the plane, she said.  'No one said anything. No one did anything. You could hear a pin drop on that plane. You could feel the tension, but no one did anything,' she said.  During the incident in Australia, Heard said that after Depp's security arrived to offer help, he took out his penis and said he would write messages for her in urine. Heard recalled the security officers being amused.  In the courtroom, Depp grinned when his ex-wife mentioned him urinating.  Heard described several other scenes of violence over the course of the day, including one in which she said he punched her so hard in the face that she thought he had broken her nose. Depp had accused her of flirting with another woman, she said.  At another point, Heard said Depp had grabbed her by the hair and kicked her in the back in a hotel room during the press tour for Depp's 2015 film Mortdecai. She sobbed as she recalled checking the internet for photos of her red carpet appearance because she had brought a strapless dress to wear, and was concerned about bruises or marks showing up in the photos.  Depp and Heard were married in a civil ceremony in Los Angeles at Depp's mother's home, and then flew to the actor's private island for a party and beachside celebration with friends and family. Although he was wealthier than she was, Heard said Depp refused to entertain the notion of creating a prenuptial contract.  'He said the only way out of this was death,' she said of their marriage.  Heard is expected to resume testimony next week. ",

In response, the Instagram user wrote, 'Ya son prolly play with ghost writers.'  The snarky comment was in reference to past controversies where the Canadian rapper was accused of relying on ghostwriters and not drafting his own verses. Drake , who goes by @champagnepapi on the platform, decided to respond in the most Drake way: He swiftly tracked down the commenter's wife and followed her on Instagram.  'I just followed your girl cause she's prob miserable and needs some excitement in her life,' he teased.

HBO has unveiled an extended look at the forthcoming prequel set hundreds of years before the events of Thrones and based on author George R.R. Martin's 2018 novel, Fire & Blood. The trailer attempts to capture much of what made the flagship series so successful: Dragons roar, families squabble and dynasties almost certainly crumble in the roughly minute-long clip, which puts the ruthless House Targaryen front and centre. Sporting a set of blonder than blond wigs, King Viserys Targaryen (Paddy Considine) and his children, Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) and Prince Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith), rule over the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros before, as Thrones history tells us, a brutal civil war tears the family apart. The prequel series, however, begins with the Targaryens firmly seated on the Iron Throne, as we see glimpses of recognisable rivals Houses Stark, Velaryon, and Lannister pledging their allegiance to the family. But in the trailer, the threats appear to be a bit closer to home. The Targaryen children openly thirst for power, with a woman warning the princess, who is named as the king's heir, 'Men would sooner put the realm to the torch than see a woman ascend the Iron Throne.'  As the title promises, there are dragons galore here -- the creatures were thought to be extinct at the start of Thrones -- with Smith's character seemingly accessorising his outfits with a scaled dragon egg. The trailer concludes with one of the fire-breathers doing what it does best, as an unseen character ominously says, 'History does not remember blood. It remembers names.' Scheduled to premiere 21 Aug on HBO and HBO Max, House Of The Dragon also stars Olivia Cooke, Steve Toussaint, Eve Best, Fabien Frankel, Sonoya Mizuno and Rhys Ifans.

Conservative leader of Carlisle City Council, John Mallinson, vented his frustration after Labour picked up control of the new Cumberland authority after Thursday's round voting. The Tories lost 14 seats on the council in north west England, while Labour gained 12 and took overall control. Mallinson, who will see the council he led replaced by the new Cumberland authority, told the BBC that he had 'lost some very good colleagues' in the election, and had found it 'difficult to drag the debate back to local issues' while campaigning because of partygate and the cost-of-living crisis. Mallinson said: 'I don't think it was helping to get comments from people like George Eustice talking about people using value brands to ease their shopping bills. That just seems to have come over very patronising.' He added: 'I think it is not just partygate, there is the integrity issue. Basically I just don't feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.' Asked if he thought Conservative MPs should oust the PM, Mallinson said: 'That would be my preference, yes.' On Sky News, he said: '(Johnson) must shoulder a lot of the blame. I have been canvassing in rural areas over the last few weeks and it's been the one issue that people have brought up time and time again. Partygate, the cost of living crisis, the feel that the government were not in touch ... and sadly I have to say the prime minister cannot be relied upon to necessarily to be telling the truth.' He added: 'I think he should consider his position now.' When asked whether the areas three Tory MPs in the region should attempt to oust Johnson, he replied: 'I call upon them to do what they think is right.' Meanwhile, Johnson's Tories face losing control of a flagship London authority to Labour - but there was a mixed picture for Keir Starmer's party outside the capital. Wandsworth, which has been a Conservative authority for more than 40 years, looks set to fall to Labour, with the Tories fearing other boroughs will also be lost. But outside London, the Liberal Democrats won Hull from Labour, while the Greens also picked up seats in contests around England. Council seats are up for grabs in Scotland, Wales and many parts of England, while there are elections to Stormont in Northern Ireland. Votes were only being counted in some of the English contests overnight, including key authorities in the capital.",
    "a5300fe1e74ed2ea82a04a355e0d00a0fa61d49a78516115aec9e91a": "Thousands of votes have been counted in English council elections overnight, with results declared by 58 authorities. With hundreds more to come across the UK, here's what we know so far. Labour makes advances in London  The clearest trend of the night was the Conservative vote going down in the capital, reflecting ongoing changes in voting habits that have increasingly tilted London towards Labour. In the most significant result overnight, the flagship Tory council of Wandsworth fell to Labour. 'Boris Johnson losing Wandsworth is monumental,' a Labour source said. 'This was the Tories' jewel in the crown.'  The south London borough is renowned for its low taxes and went Tory in 1978. It's almost obligatory to refer to it as Margaret Thatcher's favourite council. Labour weren't finished there, with the Conservatives also losing Westminster - which it had held since the authority was created in 1964 - and Barnet. These are two more huge scalps for Keir Starmer. Tory fury with Boris Johnson The elections are taking place against the backdrop of the partygate scandal, a Tory MP resigning over watching porn in the Commons chamber and the squeeze on household budgets. Unsurprisingly, national issues were having an effect as dozens of Conservative councillors lost their seats across the country. Labour won the new Cumberland Council, where all three local MPs are Tory, prompting a local Conservative leader to call for the PM to go. John Mallinson, leader of Carlisle City Council, which will be replaced by the new Cumberland authority, told the BBC: 'I think it is not just partygate, there is the integrity issue. 'Basically I just don't feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.' In Portsmouth, where the Tories lost four seats, Simon Bosher the leader of the Conservative group, said Johnson should 'take a good, strong look in the mirror' because 'those are people that are actually bearing the brunt on the doorstep of behaviour of what's been going on in Westminster'. Ravi Govindia, leader of the Wandsworth Tories, said: 'Let's not be coy about it, of course national issues were part of the dilemma people were facing.' The Lib Dems and Greens make gains  It was a good night for the 'third parties'. The Liberal Democrats added to recent Westminster by-election successes in North Shropshire and Chesham and Amersham by securing victory in Hull in a straight fight with Labour for control of the authority. The Conservatives also lost control of West Oxfordshire after the Lib Dems made a series of gains. At around 6am, the Lib Dems had gained one authority and 34 more seats while the Greens had put on 19 councillors. Questions over Labour's progress nationwide The big war of spin in the next few hours is likely to be over whether Labour are making sufficient gains - particularly in the 'red wall' seats that transformed the electoral map in 2019. As well as success in Cumberland (a Labour source is quoted as saying: 'Workington man has voted Labour') and London, Labour also gained control of Southampton from the Conservatives. But Tories activists were quick to point to a lack of progress elsewhere. Labour maintained its grip on Sunderland, and slowed the shedding of seats in recent years. But is steadying the ship in its former heartlands good enough given the government's recent troubles? The Conservatives claimed the 'blue wall is building' after making gains in Nuneaton and Bedworth, which will be another disappointment for Labour. But Keir Starmer's party will be keen to point to the drubbing they took at the last general election, and the fact that the last time these specific seats were contested four years ago set a high bar to clear given Theresa May's chaotic administration.",
    "e774cb84e023df7cb7e89a8bb753d1a2a5041d5f3016fa4046570633": "Labour has taken two major scalps by winning the flagship Tory councils of Westminster and Wandsworth. The totemic victories came amid fresh calls from Conservatives for Boris Johnson to quit as party leader. In another boost for Keir Starmer, Labour gained Barrnet Council in north London from the Conservatives. Labour has also won the new Cumberland Council, where all three local MPs are Tory. Wandsworth, renowned for its low taxes, turned blue in 1978, a year before Margaret Thatcher, who considered the council her favourite, was elected prime minister. 'Boris Johnson losing Wandsworth is monumental. This was the Tories' jewel in the crown,' a Labour source said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said that 'history has been made' with the victory. Khan tweeted a photograph of himself standing beside Labour councillor Simon Hogg, the council's new leader. Alongside the photograph, Khan wrote: 'The three words we've wanted to hear for so long: WANDSWORTH LABOUR GAIN.' Westminster has been held by the Tories since its creation in 1964, and was where Johnson cast his ballot yesterday. In Barnet, the outgoing Conservative leader Daniel Thomas said: 'I think this is a warning shot from Conservative supporters and I think our loss today is not only due to the fact that I have just mentioned but also a fair number of Conservative voters who just didn't go out to vote, stayed at home.' He added: 'Clearly if Labour are to get a majority in Parliament they need to win Barnet. They won the council, if they win our parliamentary constituencies as well, then it doesn't bode well for us to form a Government in future general elections.' The Tories also lost Worcester to no overall control, with gains for the Greens and Labour. Labour also gained Southampton from the Tories, who only won control of the council last year. But there were signs Labour was struggling to make significant gains elsewhere outside the M25. Meanwhile, the Lib Dems took Kingston upon Hull from Labour and were also edging towards winning West Oxfordshire from the Tories. Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: 'This is a great night for the Liberal Democrats. We're making progress all over the country - building on our historic by-election victories last year.' The elections are set against the backdrop of the partygate scandal and a cost-of-living crisis that could turn into a recession. Council seats are also up for grabs in Scotland, Wales and many parts of England, while Northern Ireland is electing its new assembly in what could be the most significant vote of them all, with Sinn Fein seeking to become the largest party. Many of the English seats were last contested in 2018, during Theresa May's chaotic administration, meaning there may only be limited opportunities for opposition parties to make further gains.",
    "a38eb269e6db57e00319566bbd07ec2b1171c9999dd70e82fc41eb7f": "Feeling powerless is a desperate, overwhelming sensation, yet one that's very much embedded in the human experience - especially lately. Many are facing this crippling, paralysing reaction, thanks to war, the pandemic, attacks on women's rights and so many more events seemingly out of our control. This emotion can affect anyone, including the therapists who often help others work through it.  'As a therapist, a lot of people assume that I have it all together, or don't experience mental health challenges myself - which couldn't be farther from the truth,' said Rachel Wright, a licensed therapist in New York. 'Not only do I have diagnosed major depressive disorder and panic disorder, but I also have times where I feel powerless and hopeless. While I can show up for my own clients, I sometimes struggle to show up for myself.'  Below, Wright and other therapists share their go-to coping tips for when they're feeling powerless: Schedule an appointment with a therapist They practice what they preach. Wright said therapy is a core component in mental health hygiene, and she's not alone in this belief. Dr. Paul Poulakos, a board-certified psychiatrist in New York, pointed out that therapy can help in situations when you're feeling hopeless and are struggling to navigate that. 'If you are not coping with your own mental health, it makes being empathetic very difficult, as well as burnout being more probable,' Poulakos said. 'More specifically, [therapy] can assist us in reframing our circumstances and the negative thinking that often leaves us feeling hopeless or powerless.' Say no to anything that is going to add to your emotion right now Poulakos said he cannot emphasise enough how important it is to have boundaries when you're feeling hopeless. 'Learn how to say no and make sure you are doing it once in a while,' he said. 'If I ever even start to feel selfish for saying no to things, this reminds me to take inventory and question whether I'm setting boundaries.' These boundaries can be as simple as taking a few moments to yourself in the middle of the day, or taking some time off work. 'Whether it be for a day or for a month, taking a vacation does not always need to be an extreme and costly trip -- sometimes closing the laptop and unplugging is all you need,' Poulakos said. Establish your 'core four' Identify four activities that help you to feel 'grounded, connected and happy,' said Forrest Talley, a clinical psychologist based in California.  For example, yours could be cycling, interior design, fostering dogs and traveling. One of his personal tools is building something, like home projects.  Terri Cole, a licensed psychotherapist and author of Boundary Boss, said her core activities include mindful movement like yoga, baking, journaling and getting out in nature. Therapist Alfiee Breland-Noble, founder of The AAKOMA Project and host of the Couched in Color podcast, also finds that spending time in nature is therapeutic and calming, and says this is one of her first lines of attack against feelings of powerlessness. 'I set my intention on being positive, and find activities for the remainder of the day that help me maintain my peace,' she said. Find a way to burn off anxious energy 'Exercise is so helpful in blowing off steam,' said Dr. Alex Dimitriu, a double board-certified psychiatrist and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine.  Talley said intensive exercise is one of his 'constant go-to' stress relievers. 'When things even begin to feel over the top, I'll put extra intensity into my workouts,' he said. Think: heavy weight training, HIIT or judo (some of his favorites).  If that's not your thing, try some gentle movement, like walking, biking, swimming or yoga. Moving your body may help expel some of the stress that's physically building up inside. Go somewhere calming without your phone It can be easy to doomscroll into oblivion when there are events happening in the world that you have no power over. Breaks are necessary for survival. Try spending some time in a relaxing place where you don't have access to constant information. Dimitriu personally enjoys sitting in a steam room or sauna. 'These are becoming [some of] the few places you can sit without access to your phone,' he said. 'I've had some amazing insights, peaceful meditation, and mind relaxation in the quiet silence of a steam room. The heat helps, too.' Spend a few moments focusing on something that makes you feel uplifted This could be practising a skill you know you excel at, leaning into your spirituality or faith (which means something different to everyone), or reading a book or poem that speaks to you. Breland-Noble uses mantras. Simple phrases with powerful messages, these short sentences provide meaning and hope. 'Phrases like 'The cream always rises to the top,' 'Remember who you are,' 'You come from a long line of proud people who overcame tremendous odds,' and 'You are equipped with everything you need,'' are some that allow her to find footing, she said. Lean on loved ones Whether it's your partner, immediate family, best friend or a wider community, nearly every therapist recommended talking to and spending time with loved ones.  'Spending time with family is important,' said Talley, who noted that he becomes even more conscious of the need for time with his wife and children when times are particularly tough.  Find something you can do 'Personally, when I feel powerless or hopeless - usually about the state of the world as opposed to the state of my life - I focus on what I can do,' Cole said. This can include sharing resources for people, donating to organizstions that make a difference in the world, advocating for causes you care about, posting your thoughts on social media, and engaging in thoughtful conversations with others. Another thing you can do? Take care of your basic needs. 'I try to eat a little better, sleep a little better, move a little bit more, and talk with that small circle of people that help me see more clearly and accurately,' said Kevin Gilliland, a clinical psychologist based in Texas.  You do have control over something, no matter what: yourself and your actions.",
    "d564b4bd45fa34c883e242bf151d446e443708e0c7bc0ccfdabade84": "It's easy to smile at the thought of a margarita.  'It's the world's favourite cocktail, and there are good reasons why,' Jeremy Bohen, mixologist and co-founder of the canned cocktail brand QNSY, tells HuffPost. 'The ingredients are widely available and relatively inexpensive, and it doesn't require much in the way of tools or technique. Plus, the flavours are straightforward enough for the occasional imbiber, but still sophisticated enough to appeal to a connoisseur.'  For many people, this drink is all about good times. 'Margaritas are for celebrating and getting together with friends,' says Ana Martinez, assistant director of food and beverage and agave spirits expert at Hilton Los Cabos Beach & Golf Resort. Yet as much as this is a cocktail that gives off laid-back, happy vibes, it also requires attention to detail and balance. 'Creating a well-made margarita is similar to dancing the tango,' saysGabriela Abaroa, bartender at the Ritz-Carlton Sarasota. 'The flavours are the complete opposite of one another, but they also complement each other perfectly.' And, like every good drink, this one should keep you wanting more. 'A perfect margarita should hold you in a perpetual cycle of being refreshed, while causing you to become thirsty for another one,' said Maxwell Reis, beverage director at West Hollywood, California's Gracias Madre. Experts prefer rocks, not blended Our cocktail experts are firmly on team 'rocks,' with none of them preferring a blended drink. 'A truly well-constructed margarita becomes too diluted when blended with ice,' says food photographer, recipe developer and author Jackie Alpers. 'I definitely prefer rocks to frozen, because you get a better sense of the details when you don't blend it into a slush,' says Eric Trueheart, co-founder of Black Yeti Beverage. 'Don't get me wrong, the slurpee margarita is a fun drink, without a doubt. But if you want to taste something complex, interesting and delicious, rocks is the best way to go.' One easy step that too many people skip Before you even get started, pop your glassware in the freezer. 'Just one minute in a freezer will keep your cocktail as cold as when you use warmed-up plates to keep meals warm,' says Jim Wrigley, beverage manager at the Cayman Islands Kimpton Seafire Resort & Spa's Coccoloba Bar & Grill. And pay attention to your ice As you're getting ready to shake your cocktail, keep in mind that another factor separating a 'meh' at-home drink from a 'wow' mixologist-made one is the quality of the ice you're using. 'If your ice tastes like the other things in your freezer, you're in for a not-so-tasty surprise,' Reis says. 'I don't think most at-home drinkers realise how much of that ice turns into water that becomes a large portion of your drink. And if you're using flimsy ice, it will melt too quickly, and you'll wind up with a watery marg that's not cold enough.' Don't worry too much about buying fancy bar equipment, because anything can be a shaker, experts say. 'Shake it up in whatever's easiest for you - an 'official' cocktail shaker, mason jar or blender,' says Valerie Alvarado, national portfolio agave ambassador at Pernod Ricard. It won't take long, we promise: 'Shake it five to 10 seconds, depending on how vigorous you want to be,' says Lime Fresh Mexican Grill's beverage director, Ethan Albrecht-Carrie. And then, as fun as it is to act like Tom Cruise in 'Cocktail,' stop. 'Don't overshake the cocktail, or you'll water it down,' says Anthony Aviles, director of operations at the Ritz-Carlton Sarasota. Get the right tequila The good news is that the alcohol you use in margaritas doesn't need to be an over-the-top brand. 'Choose a quality silver tequila, but don't go crazy on price,' Bohen says. 'Aged tequila is great to sip on its own, but in my opinion, it's out of place in a margarita.' As you're shopping, be sure to read labels carefully. 'Tequila should be 100% agave,' Abaroa says. He's a fan of blanco tequila, noting its 'definitive, clean flavour.' The presence of agave in tequila is key, the experts say. 'Any tequila that doesn't say '100% agave' is usually mixed in with other materials like syrups and extracts, so stay away from those,' says Xyza Dapal, food and beverage operations manager at Philadelphia's Sabroso + Sorbo in The Notary Hotel. While you're reading labels, take note of where the bottle was produced. 'Tequilas from the Los Altos region, with oven-baked agaves, really bring the citrus, fruit and roasted agave flavour,' Alvarado says. Add only the best ingredients Since it has just a few ingredients, you don't need to cut corners with pre-made mixers. Those bright yellow and orange concoctions, Aviles says, are akin to 'tempting the ulcer gods and dancing with diabetes.' Sweetener: Most recipes call for agave or simple syrup, and preferences varied among our experts. 'Use good organic agave nectar,' Albrecht-Carrie says. 'I prefer a light amber, because darker agave nectars tend to overpower and need to be diluted.' On the other hand, you've probably got what you need in your pantry to whip up simple syrup, if you'd rather use that. 'I know some people like to use agave in margaritas, and there's some poetry there, but I much prefer simple syrup,' Bohen says. 'It really is simple to make. Use equal parts water and sugar, warmed just enough to dissolve the sugar.' Fresh juice: 'I truly believe that without fresh lime juice, margaritas lack the tartness and acid that can only be attained from limes,' said cocktail influencer Carlos Ruiz. That fresh juice, it turns out, brings more to your drink than just its liquid. 'Hand-juicing the limes will introduce the delicate oils which come from the peel,' says Stuart Yurczyk, co-founder, vice president and general manager at Mixly Cocktail Co. 'Citrus oils have a fantastic aroma and add depth to your cocktails.' Once you've mastered the art of juicing limes, you may want to experiment with flavors by tossing in other fresh ingredients. 'Adding freshly cut jalapeno, mango, strawberry, avocado or even cilantro will elevate your margarita,' Alvarado says. Salt: Whether you're a salted-rim lover or hater, you can find a mixologist who shares your views. On the 'pro' side, Wrigley is a believer. 'Good salt is essential,' he says. 'We use Maldon salt for the classics and homemade spicy salt, using local peppers, for our Spicy Margarita. Another fantastic element is Gusano salt, a Mexican salt using the 'worm,' a grub that feeds on ripe agaves. And we house-smoke salt, using local logwood, for our Mezcal Margaritas.' But not everyone is pro-salt. According to Carlos Kronen, founder and executive director of The Bartender Company, a mobile bartending service, it's not a good idea. 'Salt kills your palate, so a salted rim is only recommended when using low-end tequila,' he says. Somewhere in the middle of the salt debate is Alicia Perry, general manager at San Diego's Polite Provisions. 'When it comes to a salt rim, I always ask about the customer's preference, because salt isn't for everyone,' she says. 'I personally prefer a partial salt rim, so I have a choice with each sip.' Garnishes: Use fresh citrus twists or wedges, fresh peppers or anything else you like. Perhaps try checking out local ingredients to make a margarita truly 'yours.' Alpers mentions a unique garnish she enjoyed at Tucson's El Crisol mezcal bar. 'It was finished with a dried lime slice and creosote leaves,' she said. 'Those leaves come from a bush native to Tucson that releases a sweet smell whenever it rains - or when it's floating on top of a drink. It was a perfect expression of the Tucson desert in every way.' Spicy touches: Once you've mastered the basics, you might want to incorporate other elements, like heat. 'I remember the first time I had a spicy margarita, and it changed my entire understanding of what a margarita can be,' Yurczyk says. 'I'm a Midwest native, so it didn't take long for sweat to begin beading up around my nose and cheekbones, but I was addicted. I hadn't realised it until that moment, but the tequila's smoothness, lime juice's acidity and orange liqueur's sweetness were practically begging for the addition of spice.' 'I was on my honeymoon a looong time ago in Puerto Vallarta and was served a pineapple chile margarita,' says Dora Stone, founder of the vegan Mexican recipe blog Dora's Table. She remains a fan of margarita heat, and her blog includes a popular recipe for a Spicy Hibiscus Ice Margarita. Another tip from Stone: 'Add candied jalapenos or chile powder on the rim, like the ever-so-popular mango chamoy margarita.'",

Oh, and FYI -- prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication. It's easy to assume acne is just a teen thing. You don't expect that in your mid twenties your skin will, almost overnight, breakout in painful spots. But adult acne is actually super common.  The British Association of Dermatologists reported that 19% of adults aged 25 and over have reported experiencing some form of adult acne, with causes ranging from hormonal imbalances and stress to pollution and clogged pores. And it can be highly stressful if it happens to you.  I say this because I know. All through my teens I had pretty perfect skin (minus the odd party-pooping zit). I felt blessed by the skin gods. But in my early twenties, I noticed I was breaking out with lots of teeny tiny spots, primarily across my t-zone. My skin was painful, red and super sore.  Adult acne was completely new to me, and like any newbie, I tried product after product, each of which promised miracle results, but failed to deliver.  In fact, they often seemed to be making my skin worse. I didn't know it at the time, but acne can actually be exacerbated by using the wrong products for your skin type, and not having a proper targeted skincare routine. Whoops.  I was starting to feel I'd never have blemish free skin again. Then, a friend recommended that I try Nip+Fab's Teen Skin Fix range and, honestly, it's the one. While there's nothing wrong with blemishes (after all, we all get them), if you're finding it hard living with adult acne and the pain and soreness it brings, these are the products I swear by and have used religiously for five years. They might be designed with teens in mind, but don't be put off by the packaging - they're a total game-changer for adult acne, too - both targeting and future-proofing against the blemishes that can blight your skin. The range - face-wash, pads, roller-ball and moisturiser - combines a potent dose of salicylic acid with wasabi extract and tea tree oil, which penetrate deep into your pores to remove impurities and stop breakouts at the source.  If that sounds like blurb, what matters, of course, is results - and I've got them. Even for super sensitive skin like mine, the products didn't cause any issues. My skin now looks and feels much healthier, and my acne is finally under control.",

    "0bf8d07556aa89273e18a2be3fa38b969bdf737b14d473c93aa23ab0": "The Bank of England has issued a stark warning to British people that the economy is at risk of slipping into a recession as it raised interest rates to 1%. The central bank's hike - by a quarter of a percentage point - means the base rate is at a level last seen in 2009. The move is designed to curb the soaring cost of goods and services - known as inflation - which could go above above 10%, which would be a 40-year high. While effectively putting the brakes on spells bad news for people borrowing money, with mortgage holders likely to feel the immediate impact, it was largely predicted - and could be followed by more increases. The biggest shock came in the warning of a recession - a word that sends alarm bells ringing for many - as the Ukraine war compounds a crippling cost-of-living crisis. What is a recession?  A technical recession is defined by two successive quarters of falling economic output - measured by gross domestic product (GDP), which attempts to summarise all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy in a single figure. Some people argue the term 'recession' is an unreliable indicator because people could be suffering all the effects of an economic downturn, such as long-term unemployment, but the data might not be officially say as much. For instance, a 'double-dip recession' is when a recession is followed by a short-lived recovery and another recession, but people's lives do not feel much different throughout that period. Recessions ultimately have an impact on living standards, but the full effect largely depends on the scale of unemployment and how long it takes for businesses and the jobs market to recover. What's the outlook? On Thursday, the Bank predicted that growth will contract in the final three months of 2022 as the cost squeeze sees households rein in their spending. The UK is set to narrowly miss a technical recession, but the Bank forecast 'very weak' quarterly growth in 2023 and a contraction as a whole next year. They predict GDP will fall by 0.25% and unemployment will pick up sharply. 'It is a very weak projection, a very sharp slowdown,' Bank governor Andrew Bailey told reporters. 'There's a technical definition of a recession it doesn't meet - but put that to one side - it is a very sharp slowdown in activity.' When was the last recession? Not that long ago. In 2020, the Office for National Statistics officially declared the UK in recession - the steepest on record - after the economy plunged by 19.6% between April and June due to the coronavirus lockdown. It followed a 2.2% contraction in the previous three months - marking the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis, when the UK fell into a year-long recession. But this was followed by growth of 17.4% in the third quarter of 2020 - underlining how the economy was lurching from one extreme to another during the early stages of the pandemic.  What is fuelling a potential recession? The world is being buffeted by a unique set of circumstances. Inflation is surging as a result of the easing of the pandemic. It means the costs of goods and services have become more expensive because of a number of factors - such as the scarcity of workers unwilling to do jobs they previously had, and pent-up demand from consumers. Economists believed this was a big problem as the cost of life's expenses was growing faster than people's wages, but that would only be temporary. Then Russia invaded Ukraine, which sent energy prices spiraling given the world's reliance and oil and gas from the region. The Bank has said it was also worried about the impact of renewed Covid-19 lockdowns in China which threaten to hit supply chains again and add to inflation pressures. What is 'stagflation'?  Economists think the Bank is walking a tightrope to avoid an economic 'perfect storm' called stagflation - a contradictory situation where costs are rising but fewer people are in work. The worst of all worlds. Raising interest rates might help to combat inflation, but that could mean the economy stalls. Using interest rates could be a particularly blunt instrument when the inflationary pressures are coming from overseas with higher energy costs. The risk is this: more nudges by way of further interest rate hikes could be the catalyst for a full-blown recession.",

The prime minister's sit-down with the ITV breakfast show made headlines for a number of reasons earlier this week, one of which came after Susanna introduced Lorraine, who hosts the show directly after GMB. 'Who's Lorraine?' Johnson asked. 'Who's Lorraine? Lorraine is a legend,' Susanna replied. The moment soon went viral - and even drew a response from former GMB host Piers Morgan - with Lorraine now having her say on the matter.  Speaking on the Be Honest podcast, she said: '[It] was brilliant, and brilliant because she let him speak. She wasn't trying to point score. She was just trying to get to the heart of the matter. 'And it wasn't kind of two alpha males. It was a forensic, really intelligent interview. She absolutely did her homework and he was on the ropes, because he's broad strokes, he's not attention to detail.' Co-host Bruce Devlin asked Lorraine: 'You say Boris doesn't have attention to detail, how on earth does he not know who you are?' She replied: 'I don't expect him to.' Asked if Boris Johnson knows who Lorraine is, the PM's spokesperson previously told HuffPost UK: 'I think as was clear the prime minister was not fully across the ITV daytime lineup this morning. He has a number of issues to deal with.' Piers Morgan said it was 'over' for Johnson after his apparent knowledge gap.  Trailing his TalkTV show Piers Morgan Uncensored in a chat with the channel's Tom Newton-Dunn, Piers said: 'We all know Lorraine Kelly. I think he knows Lorraine Kelly, he just didn't know what on earth was going on in that whole interview.' He continued: 'I thought Susanna skewered him beautifully and he just lost his way and lost his mind, as he does so often. 'The trouble is he can probably survive partygate to a degree, maybe even survive surging inflation. He can't survive insulting Lorraine Kelly - it's over. It's over for him.' The Lorraine Kelly episode of Be Honest, which is hosted by comedians Jojo Sutherland and Bruce Devlin, is available on Monday online.",

The Call Me By Your Name actor was due to tread the boards in an adaptation of the critically acclaimed play 4,000 Miles at The Old Vic.  The production, which was also set to star Dame Eileen Atkins, was originally scheduled to open in London in April 2020 but was postponed when theatres across the country had to close their doors due to the pandemic.  However, The Old Vic has now confirmed the show will not be going ahead after it proved 'impossible' to reschedule.  A statement said: 'Following the postponement of 4000 Miles due to the pandemic, and despite an enormous amount of effort from all involved, we have now sadly and reluctantly concluded that we are unable to reschedule the production at a time possible for everyone involved. 'After two years of trying hard to make it work, it has proved impossible. 'We're sorry not to have better news, and we want to thank our audiences for their continued patience and understanding.' Timothee was due to star as 21-year-old Leo, who, after suffering a major loss during a summer bike riding trip, seeks solace in the New York home of his 91-year-old grandmother, Vera.  Thursday's announcement was met with disappointment from Timothee's fans on social media... The actor is one of Hollywood's most sought-after young actors having recently starred in 2021's Dune and 2019's Little Women.

In fact, in the last few years it has become an informal social media tradition for people to share photos of their pooches at the polling station. And this year is no exception - even prime minister Boris Johnson and London mayor Sadiq Khan brought their dogs along to vote. Council seats in Scotland, Wales, London and parts of England are available while Northern Ireland is electing its new assembly, with polls open until 10pm. But today's local elections, where the Conservatives are expected to experience significant losses, saw some extra additions joining the #DogsAtPollingStations trend... Here's a roundup of the most unusual photos making the rounds to light up your day. Dogs behaving badly at the ballot box Owners doing the most for their pooches Who let the dogs out? Pups in prams at the polling stations When your pup takes pride in dogmocracy But, step aside dogs... the cows turned out too Then the cats made an appearance Occasionally, there was a colliding of worlds And it's equal opportunities for smaller pets... In England, more than 4,000 council seats are up for grabs in 146 councils in major cities. The results are expected to be announced around midnight, with the final counts coming in over the weekend."
