That includes a further 771 who surrendered, they say, in the last 24 hours. 80 were wounded. The Russian defence ministry says 'those in need of inpatient treatment receive assistance in medical institutions' in Novoazovsk and Donetsk. The International Committee for Red Cross has stated that it has now registered 'hundreds' of Ukrainian POWs who left the Azovstal steel plant this week. The Swiss department of foreign affairs has announced that it will reopen its embassy in Kyiv. Reuters reports five staff members, including the ambassador, are set to return to the Ukrainian capital over the next few days. The decision to reopen Switzerland's embassy after it was temporarily closed two and a half months ago was based on an in-depth analysis of the security situation, the ministry said. Kursk regional governor Roman Starovoy has posted again to Telegram with further details of what he claims was an attack on the village of Tyotkino in Russia, which is right on the border with Ukraine. His message says he is visiting the area: The message states that his visit continues. Earlier he posted some images to Telegram purporting to be from the scene of the alleged attack. Italian prime minister Mario Draghi has called for an urgent ceasefire in Ukraine so that serious negotiations can begin to end the war that began with Russia's latest invasion almost three months ago. 'A ceasefire must be achieved as soon as possible,' Reuters reports Draghi told the upper house Senate in Rome, opening a debate on Italy's role in supporting Ukraine, which is creating growing tensions in the premier's ruling majority. Draghi said it was important to maintain pressure on Russia through economic sanctions 'because we have to bring Moscow to the negotiating table.' Poland's prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said that his nation would defend Sweden and Finland if they were attacked even before they joined Nato.  'I consider the accession of Sweden and Finland to Nato as an important signal of strengthening security in Europe,' Reuters report he said during a conference. 'I want to make it clear that in the event of an attack on Sweden or Finland during their accession, Poland will come to their aid.' Finland's prime minister Sanna Marin has given an interview to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, and the key lines appear to be that she is ruling out Nato locating a permanent base or nuclear weapons on Finnish soil. She says (in translation): She said that, even without Nato assistance, Finland was well placed to defend itself: She had strong words about Russia's latest invasion of Ukraine, telling the newspaper: Here is the statement from the International Committee of the Red Cross over prisoners of war who have surrendered from Azovstal: Russia's defence ministry, according to their morning briefing on Telegram, has said 1,730 fighters have surrendered from Azovstal since Monday.

The Russian defence ministry says 'those in need of inpatient treatment receive assistance in medical institutions' in Novoazovsk and Donetsk. The International Committee for Red Cross has stated that it has now registered 'hundreds' of Ukrainian POWs who left the Azovstal steel plant this week. Here are some of the latest images we have been sent across the newswires from Ukraine. Russia's news agency Tass is quoting Denis Pushilin, who is head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine, as saying that more than half of the Ukrainian fighters who were inside Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant have now left the plant. The reports are unclear on an exact number, and have not been independently verified. There has been confusion over exactly how many fighters were besieged in the plant. Yesterday Russia claimed that 959 Ukrainian service personnel had surrendered, of which 51 were taken to hospital. The remainder had been sent to a former prison colony in the town of Olenivka in a Russian-controlled area of Donetsk region.  Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine's governor of Luhansk, has published his latest assessment of overnight events in Ukraine. He told his Telegram followers: The claims have not been independently verified.", "b01ae995b42ad1e1215c6a831857db2eaff22a6a56d1ab8aeae1a6d8": "A 21-year-old Russian soldier asked a Ukrainian widow to forgive him for the murder of her husband, as a court in Kyiv met for a second hearing on Thursday in the first war crimes trial arising from Russia's 24 February invasion. Vadim Shishimarin, a tank commander, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to killing Oleksandr Shelipov, an unarmed 62-year-old civilian, in the north-east Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on 28 February. 'I acknowledge my blame ... I ask you to forgive me,' he told the widow, Kateryna Shalipova, on Thursday.  Dressed in a tracksuit, his shaved head lowered, Shishimarin cut a forlorn spectacle in a glass booth for defendants. He spoke calmly, but looked frightened. The Kremlin has said it has no information about the trial and that the absence of a diplomatic mission in Ukraine limits its ability to provide legal assistance.  Prosecutors asked the judge to sentence Shishimarin to life in prison. The widow told the court she had heard distant shots fired from their yard and that she had called out to her husband the day he was killed. 'I ran over to my husband, he was already dead. Shot in the head. I screamed, I screamed so much,' said Shalipova, her voice trembling with emotion. Shalipova told the court she would not object if Shishimarin was released to Russia as part of a prisoner swap to get 'our boys' out of the port city of Mariupol, a reference to hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers who have given themselves up to Russia. The trial takes place as much of Ukraine is gripped by the fate of its soldiers that it hopes Russia will hand over as part of an exchange. Some Russian people are calling for them to be put on trial for crimes. Shalipova said her husband had been unarmed and was dressed in civilian clothes. They had a 27-year-old son and two grandchildren, she added. Ukraine has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civilians during the invasion and said it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia has denied targeting civilians or being involved in war crimes. Shishimarin is accused of firing several shots with an assault rifle at a civilian's head from a car after being ordered to do so. Asked if he had been obliged to follow an order that amounted to a war crime, Shishimarin said 'no'. 'I fired a short burst, three or four bullets,' he told the court. 'I am from Irkutsk Oblast [a region in Siberia]. I have two brothers and two sisters ... I am the eldest,' he said.", "98bf4c1925ab837d87079a2742a87508ebae7798de7dfc77744153c7": "Russia's promise to use lasers to shoot down drones in Ukraine has prompted widespread scepticism that the novel and possibly nuclear-powered weaponry could be deployed on the battlefield or have any significant impact on the war. Yuri Borisov, Russia's deputy prime minister, told the country's Channel One television station that the new Zadira directed-energy weapon could destroy targets up to 5km away, and had incinerated a drone in five seconds in a test. But there was no immediate evidence to back up the claim, which was belittled by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who described it as a 'wunderwaffe' - a nonexistent 'wonder weapon' which was originally a propaganda invention of the Nazis. 'The clearer it became they [the Nazis] had no chance in the war, the more propaganda there was about the wonder weapon,' Zelenskiy said. 'Russia is trying to find its wunderwaffe. Allegedly laser. All this clearly indicates the complete failure of the invasion.' Laser systems designed to shoot down drones are being gradually developed by the world's militaries - but most are at a test or prototype stage, and their military utility in a conflict is untried.  Last month Israel's prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said the country's military had successfully tested a laser interception system called Iron Beam. 'It may sound like science fiction, but it's real,' he said on Twitter. An accompanying video showed lasers locking on to and shooting down rockets, mortars and a large drone with similarities to a Turkish TB2, which has been used by Ukraine in defence against the Russians. Laser weapons work by directing a beam of high energy to burn a target, using large amounts of electricity in the process. In the case of a drone, they melt the exterior and destroy enough of it so it cannot fly. Israel suggested it was much cheaper to use laser weapons than missile systems to shoot down rockets, missiles and drones. Bennett said the cost was $3.50 a shot, but it is not clear to what extent this figure includes the cost of power. Some analysts said the Russian systems were powered by small nuclear reactors not dissimilar to those used in submarines. Last year the UK's Ministry of Defence awarded three contracts worth about PS72.5m in total, two of which were to develop military lasers for frigates and Wolfhound armoured vehicles, with the intention of engaging in 'user experimentation' from 2023-25. Publicly declared laser weapons focus on the targeting of drones and missiles. The use of laser weapons to blind soldiers and civilians is banned by a convention signed by 109 countries, including Russia and Ukraine. One Russian analyst said Moscow would have to increase production of the weapons to make a difference to the war, in which Russian forces' attempts to take the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine have stalled to the point of near stalemate. Dmitry Stefanovich, a research fellow at the Moscow-based Center for International Security, a division of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, said: 'I think for it to become effective, Russia will need to scale up its production of the Zadira lasers. At the moment there simply isn't enough to make any real difference.' A related issue is whether Russia had a transportable energy supply to power them. A second analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Moscow's systems were reliant on small nuclear reactors to power them. 'Nothing is being used as far I understand. Russia won't be using the Zadira or Peresvet lasers in Ukraine. The problem is that these lasers are using nuclear power, which means that if Ukraine would target the installations, it would lead to a small nuclear disaster, exposing the Russian soldiers to radioactive material,' they said. 'I believe this is just a lot of hype. I don't think Russia would move their laser systems to Ukraine with all the risks involved. For example, Peresvet can hit targets within a 5km range, which means Ukraine would also be able to target it.'

Yet his own daughter's enthusiasm for sojourns to western Europe at least matches that of the oligarch 'scum and traitors' he has decried, a joint investigation by independent Russian media outlet iStories and German magazine Der Spiegel suggests. According to flight records obtained by the two publications, Putin's youngest daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, flew to Munich in southern Germany 'more than 50 times' between 2017 and 2019, travelling on chartered flights with full state support and in the company of employees of Putin's own presidential security service. Among the leaked cache of documents relating to a series of flights between Moscow and Munich in spring 2020 are the passports of a then two-year-old girl - apparently a previously unknown granddaughter of the Russian president - and Igor Zelensky, the former director of the Munich state ballet. The report said it is likely that Zelensky is Tikhonova's partner and the father of her child. Unrelated to the Ukrainian president of the same surname, 52-year-old Igor Zelensky was an internationally feted dancer before he became artistic director of the Bayerisches Staatsballet in 2016. He stepped down from his role on 4 April citing 'private family reasons', having failed to react to calls to condemn Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine. Zelensky still has a job on the supervisory board of Russia's National Cultural Heritage Foundation, which is building a cultural centre in Crimea and is understood to be close to Putin. An anonymous source at the Bavarian state ballet told Der Spiegel that Zelensky was 'most likely a partner of Putin's daughter', before journalists had specifically asked about his family ties. Tikhonova, 35, herself a former acrobatic rock'n'roll dancer, was previously married to Kirill Shamalov, once Russia's youngest billionaire, though the couple were reported as having separated in 2018. While iStories and Der Spiegel did not disclose the name of the 2017-born child, the outlets wrote that the girl's patronymic was Igorevna, which would correspond to former ballet director Igor Zelensky. Tikhonova did not respond to a request by Der Spiegel. Her and Zelensky's current whereabouts are unknown.", "56d6ae4514a13fbfcc0de9035c5834dd31485bf0a1afea4e6ce21194": "The former German chancellor Gerhard Schroder will lose some of his post-office privileges after failing to cut his links with Russian energy companies over the Ukraine war, the Bundestag's budgetary committee has decided. Schroder, who was German head of government from 1998 until 2005, will be stripped of his office and staff, which cost about 419,000 euros (PS354,500) in taxpayers' money in 2021. The motion, which was passed on Thursday afternoon with support from Schroder's own Social Democratic party (SPD), the Greens, and the Free Democratic party (FDP), does not name the politician's Kremlin connections or stance on the Ukraine war, most likely to avoid legal challenges. Instead, the motion argues that the former leader no longer fulfils any continuing obligation as a statesperson and therefore does not require an office and staff to do so. The main opposition party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), backed the move even though it had also called on the government to cut the ex-chancellor's pension, equivalent to an annual salary of about 100,000 euros. Schroder will keep his pension payments as well as his security detail. The four employees who used to work at Schroder's office, located almost directly opposite the Russian embassy on the Unter den Linden boulevard in Berlin, already resigned of their own accord in early March, after their boss had showed no intention of stepping down from his boardroom roles at Russian oil company Rosneft and pipeline company Nord Stream. The Bundestag budgetary committee's vote comes just hours after the European parliament urged the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to impose sanctions against Schroder because of his ties to the Kremlin. The EU legislature passed a resolution on Thursday that said sanctions after the invasion of Ukraine should be extended 'to the European members of the boards of major Russian companies and to politicians who continue to receive Russian money'. As well as the German politician, the motion indirectly addresses former Austrian foreign minister Karin Kneissl, a supervisory board member at Rosneft who danced with Vladimir Putin at her own wedding in 2018. Schroder's close personal friendship with Putin has come under heavy criticism after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, and the SPD leadership has called on the 78-year-old to hand in his party membership. The Hanover-based politician has come across as unrepentant, however. 'I don't do mea culpa,' Schroder told the New York Times in April. 'It's not my thing.'", "1f96f3e4f1a3355c9698b4e8dcfadb00037a7295212eb4b61d6a4cd2": "The sounds of war have become louder in Belgorod, a mid-sized Russian city about 25 miles (40km) from the Ukrainian border. And the blasts are more frequent. 'On Sunday, we were woken up again by explosions. You never know if it's them or us firing,' said Vladimir, a shopkeeper in the city. Locals such as Vladimir first witnessed Russia's military buildup at the start of the year, when thousands of troops amassed near Belgorod before Moscow's attack in late February. 'When the conflict started, we would hear rockets being launched into Ukraine. But now we get hit too. It is a different sound.' As the war has dragged on and Russia failed in its objective to quickly seize Kyiv, officials in Belgorod and other border cities have in recent weeks reported a series of attacks by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine has not directly accepted responsibility but has described the incidents as payback and 'karma' for Russia, almost three months after it invaded its neighbour. The apparent Ukrainian attacks, which started when two helicopters struck an oil depot in Belgorod on 1 April, have brought a new element into the war, raising the previously unthinkable possibility that some of the devastating damage that Moscow has inflicted on Ukraine will come to Russia's own territory. 'We talk a lot about what is happening, of course. The atmosphere in the city is sort of tense,' said Anna, a local teacher. 'Life goes on, but sometimes it is impossible to ignore it, like the time the city was in thick smoke,' she said, referring to the fuel depot attack. In this week alone, officials in Belgorod reported at least three attacks. Last week, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region, claimed a strike on a small town in the area had killed one Russian civilian. During the last week, Ukrainian forces have recaptured villages from Russian troops north and north-east of Kharkiv, pushing them back towards the border near Belgorod. This has given some relief to Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which is only an hour's drive from Belgorod and has been under enemy bombardment since the war began in February. And while the consensus among military experts remains that Ukraine will not aim for a push into Russian territory, its advances have been met with unease in Belgorod and across Russia. In a recent live Q and A with locals, Gladkov was forced to answer questions from worried voters about what the recent Ukrainian advances would mean for Belgorod. The governor tried to offer reassurance but admitted that certain parts of the region were under 'constant shelling'. He has also raised the city threat levels to 'yellow', the second-highest in a three-tier system, and a heavier police presence is now being felt across the city, according to Anna. There have also been reports of two fires at defence ministry facilities in the Belgorod region as well as damage inflicted to a key Russian railway bridge, leading to speculation that Ukrainian saboteurs have been active on Russian territory. Russian officials have not commented on the incidents, and it remains unclear what caused the fires. Nikita Parmenov, a journalist at the independent Fonar outlet, said the lack of information regarding some of the recent fires has led to 'fears and gossip that Ukrainians have infiltrated the towns and villages in the region'. Still, despite the direct threat posed by Ukraine, Parmenov said there were no visible signs of an upsurge in patriotism in Belgorod. 'Many here have direct links with Ukraine, they talk to relatives across the border. It feels like we have a better understanding of what is going on than most regions in Russia,' said the journalist, who has himself been in contact with his aunt from Odesa. 'Enthusiasm for the special military operation feels muted. It has torn some families apart, while others prefer not to speak about the conflict with their friends and siblings in Ukraine.' But it is not just Ukrainian attacks that have disrupted life on Russia's borderlands - the war has had broader effects, too. Since the start of the invasion, Moscow has suspended the work of 11 airports in parts of central and southern Russia that are close to Ukraine, citing the 'difficult situation surrounding Ukraine', and hindering travel for millions of Russians. Among the airports shut are those serving popular holiday destinations, including some in the annexed Crimean peninsula and the Black Sea resort towns of Gelendzhik and Krasnodar. 'I am expecting a disastrous summer holiday season,' said one hotel owner in Sevastopol. During the first weekend of May, when Russians usually travel to the country's south, the hotel occupancy rate in Crimea was 10-15%, according to a study by the Russian business outlet Kommersant. The Crimean tourism industry expects that up to 70% of hotel rooms will remain empty over the summer holidays because of difficulties travelling to Crimea and worries that the peninsula is too close to the war. 'It is going to be a tough summer,' said the owner of the mid-sized Crimean hotel. 'But in war, you have to make sacrifices.'", "84e6ac5bd94e5839b8c9a83844c969944f9b32ca4b77d6d80a996d7e": "Born in Kabul, Afghanistan, and later building a life in Ukraine, Ruhullah Haji has been displaced by war twice in 34 years. So when the heart surgeon made it to Britain after fleeing Russia's invasion, he was desperate for security and the right to remain as a Ukrainian. Many other Afghans have struggled to secure such rights since the fall of Kabul last year, and remain in limbo. Haji's application to the Ukrainian family scheme was accepted on Thursday, about a month after he applied and a day after the Guardian approached the Home Office about his case.  However, his lawyer said a decision for his wife and daughter has yet to come. It marks the end of a long and arduous road. A week after Ukraine was invaded in February, Haji crossed the Polish border alone in search of his wife and child who had already fled. At the border, he said he was treated differently. Other BAME refugees have reported similar experiences. 'Because they [volunteers] saw me: that I'm not white and I don't have green eyes and I'm not blond,' said Haji, who waited at the border for three days with no belongings. 'But ... I serve for Ukraine more than [many] Ukrainians.' He then travelled by train from Poland through Romania, Hungary, Austria and Germany over two days in search of his family, before flying to the UK. 'I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't drink, I was just walking and running, in two days,' he said. Haji had left Afghanistan for Ukraine in his teens to join his older brother. He studied Russian, adding a seventh language to his arsenal, and completed his medical degree to become a heart surgeon. He also held language classes for more than 100 Afghan refugees, worked as a refugee doctor across the Odesa region where the family lived, and later founded a clinic of his own. After reuniting with his family in Britain in March, they visited the Home Office and the following day were sent to a hotel in Blackpool to await news of their asylum application. Haji's solicitor, Nicola Burgess of the Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit, has been helping Haji's family, and others who have applied for asylum, switch to existing Ukrainian schemes. Burgess recognises that without the Ukrainian scheme, the family would be stuck in a hotel without the right to work - the experience of many Afghans. 'If you just had to flee a war zone, you have been subjected to trauma. And if you're stuck in a box room hotel, it is going to have a negative effect on a person.' The Ukraine schemes have operated with significant delays. Burgess said: 'Ruhullah is a refugee automatically, it should be a more straightforward process ... They're fleeing a war zone, there should be an automatic grant of some type of leave to remain rather than some drawn-out process.' Haji walks and jogs to stay motivated. He has started visiting a nearby library to keep on top of his studies, and the British Medical Association has recently accepted his credentials. 'Of course, I would like to go back, but now I'm a father and I have my small child, I should think about my family more than myself, than about my people who cannot live under the bombs, because we have as Afghans, we have this experience,' Haji said. 'In war there is no loser, there is no winner.' A UK government spokesperson said that after launching one of the 'fastest and biggest visa schemes in the UK history', over 102,000 visas for Ukrainians to live and work in the UK have been granted.  'The changes the Home Office has made to streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms and boosting staff numbers, are working and we are now processing visas as quickly as they come in - enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes.'", "7d96431fbcd932bb49b7e164aa35e0f16ceb75b4d2dffe5b14b94bee": "Russia has said a further 771 Ukrainian troops have 'surrendered' at Mariupol's besieged Azovstal steelworks, bringing the total number to 1,730 this week, while the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had started registering the Ukrainian prisoners of war who left the plant. The Russian defence ministry said on Thursday that 80 soldiers who surrendered in the past day were being treated for injuries in hospitals in the Russian-held cities of Novoazovsk and Donetsk. Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said on Wednesday that more than 900 troops from Azovstal had been sent to a former prison colony in the town of Olenivka, but it was not immediately clear where the latest group to surrender had gone. Ukraine has not commented on the evacuation of the soldiers since Tuesday, when its deputy defence minister said the soldiers would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, without providing further details. It is not clear how many soldiers remain inside the plant. The deputy commander of the Azov regiment, Capt Svyatoslav Palamar, released a video on Thursday evening in which he said he had not surrendered and remained in the steel mill. 'The operation is continuing. I can't give more information now,' Palamar said. He did not say how many other fighters were with him. Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk, said on Thursday that more than half the Ukrainian fighters in the bunkers below the steel plant had surrendered. Pushilin also repeated statements made earlier by Russian officials that the soldiers should be tried in court. 'Let them surrender, let them live, let them honestly face the charges for all their crimes,' Pushilin said. The Kremlin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, earlier said the combatants would be treated in line with international norms for PoWs, though several senior Russian politicians demanded they be put on trial and one even called for their execution. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has not publicly commented on the fate of the soldiers since their evacuation started on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the ICRC said it had registered 'hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war' this week from the Azovstal plant. 'The ICRC started on Tuesday 17 May to register combatants leaving the Azovstal plant, including the wounded, at the request of the parties. The operation continued Wednesday and was still ongoing Thursday. The ICRC is not transporting PoWs to the places where they are held,' the Geneva-based humanitarian agency, which has experience in working with prisoners of war, said in a statement. 'In accordance with the mandate given to the ICRC by states under the 1949 Geneva conventions, the ICRC must have immediate access to all PoWs in all places where they are held. The ICRC must be allowed to interview prisoners of war without witnesses, and the duration and frequency of these visits should not be unduly restricted,' the agency added. Several Russian media outlets and pro-Kremlin telegram channels reported on Thursday that some Ukrainian soldiers from the Azovstal plant had already been transported outside Donbas to Russian territories. According to 161, a local news outlet, 89 Ukrainian soldiers had been transferred to a detainment facility in the Russian border city of Taganrog where they will face charges of extremism in a military court for fighting in the Azov regiment, one of the main forces defending the steelworks. The Azov regiment was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and the regiment now denies being fascist, racist or neo-Nazi. The Azov movement has been used as a key part of the Russian propaganda narrative to justify the war in Ukraine. Next week, Russia's supreme court will hear an application to designate Ukraine's Azov regiment as a 'terrorist organisation', opening the way for sentences of up to 20 years for those convicted of involvement. Experts believe that a trial of the Ukrainian troops, described by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as 'heroes', would further complicate efforts to resume the stalled peace negotiations. The Russian presidential aide Sergey Kiriyenko said on Thursday that Putin personally decided that his country would 'take oversight' of the two breakaway territories that make up the Donbas, which Moscow has already recognised as independent. It was another sign that the Kremlin was looking to further annex Ukranian territory, after previously hinting that it was open to annexing seized Ukranian territories, including the southern port cities of Kherson and Mariupol. Such moves would further complicate any peace negotiations with Ukraine. Zelenskiy has repeatedly stated that the war with Russia would end only when Ukraine reclaimed everything that Russia had taken from it since the start of the war in late February. Moscow also said on Thursday that it would open access to Ukraine's Black Sea ports if the west reviewed the sanctions it had imposed on the country. Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain producers, has been unable to export its goods through ports since Russia sent troops into Ukraine, causing a spike in food prices and fears of a global food crisis.", "de8e8dd5840a3e3387ecb90dd30e130ae69c049f331b57be894ad55a": "Chemical pollution in the environment is supersizing the global obesity epidemic, according to a major scientific review. The idea that the toxins called 'obesogens' can affect how the body controls weight is not yet part of mainstream medicine. But the dozens of scientists behind the review argue that the evidence is now so strong that it should be. 'This is critical because the current clinical management of obese patients is woefully inadequate,' they said. The most disturbing aspect of the evidence is that some chemical impacts that increase weight can be passed down through generations by changing how genes work. Pollutants cited by the researchers as increasing obesity include bisphenol A (BPA), which is widely added to plastics, as well as some pesticides, flame retardants and air pollution. Global obesity has tripled since 1975, with more people now obese or overweight than underweight, and is increasing in every country studied. Almost 2 billion adults are now too heavy and 40 million children under five are obese or overweight. 'The focus of the clinical people is on calories - if you eat more calories, you're going to be more fat,' says Dr Jerrold Heindel, lead author of one of the three review papers, and formerly at the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. 'So they wait untill you get obese, then they'll look at giving you diets, drugs, or surgery. 'If that really worked, we should see a decline in the rates of obesity,' he said. 'But we don't - obesity continues to rise, especially in children. The real question is, why do people eat more? The obesogenic paradigm focuses on that and provides data that indicate that these chemicals are what can do that.' Furthermore, the scientists say, the approach offers the potential to prevent obesity by avoiding exposure to pollutants, especially in pregnant women and babies: 'Prevention saves lives, while costing far less than any [treatment].' The evidence for obesogens is set out by more than 40 scientists in three review papers, published in the peer-reviewed journal Biochemical Pharmacology and citing 1,400 studies. They say these chemicals are everywhere: in water and dust, food packaging, personal hygiene products and household cleaners, furniture and electronics. The review identifies about 50 chemicals as having good evidence of obesogenic effects, from experiments on human cells and animals, and epidemiological studies of people. These include BPA and phthalates, also a plastic additive. A 2020 analysis of 15 studies found a significant link between BPA levels and obesity in adults in 12 of them. Other obesogens are pesticides, including DDT and tributyltin, former flame retardants and their newer replacements, dioxins and PCBs, and air pollution. Several recent studies link exposure to dirty air early in life to obesity. The review also names PFAS compounds - so-called 'forever chemicals' due to their longevity in the environment - as obesogens. These are found in food packaging, cookware, and furniture, including some child car seats. A two-year, randomised clinical trial published in 2018 found people with the highest PFAS levels regained more weight after dieting, especially women. Some antidepressants are also well known to cause weight gain. 'That is a proof of principle that chemicals made for one thing can have side effects that interfere with your metabolism,' said Heindel. Other chemicals with some evidence of being obesogens included some artificial sweeteners and triclosan, an antibacterial agent banned from some uses in the US in 2017. Obesogens work by upsetting the body's 'metabolic thermostat', the researchers said, making gaining weight easier and losing weight harder. The body's balance of energy intake and expenditure through activity relies on the interplay of various hormones from fat tissue, the gut, pancreas, liver, and brain. The pollutants can directly affect the number and size of fat cells, alter the signals that make people feel full, change thyroid function and the dopamine reward system, the scientists said. They can also affect the microbiome in the gut and cause weight gain by making the uptake of calories from the intestines more efficient. 'It turns out chemicals dumped in the environment have these side effects, because they make the cells do things that they wouldn't otherwise have done, and one of those things is laying down fat,' said Prof Robert Lustig at the University of California, San Francisco, and lead author of another of the reviews. The early years of child development are the most vulnerable to obesogens, the researchers wrote: 'Studies showed that in utero and early-life exposures were the most sensitive times, because this irreversibly altered programming of various parts of the metabolic system, increasing susceptibility for weight gain.' 'We've got four or five chemicals that also will cause transgenerational epigenetic obesity,' said Heindel, referring to changes in the expression of genes that can be inherited. A 2021 study found that women's level of obesity significantly correlated with their grandmothers' level of exposure to DDT, even though their granddaughters were never directly exposed to the now banned-pesticide. 'People need to know that [obesogenic effects] are going on,' Lustig said. 'Because it affects not just them, but their unborn children. This problem's going to affect generation after generation until we get a hold of it.' Directly proving a causal link between a hazard and a human health impact is difficult for the simple reason that it is not ethical to perform harmful experiments on people. But strong epidemiological evidence can stack up to a level equivalent to proof, such as with tobacco smoking and lung cancer. Lustig said that point had been reached for obesogens, 16 years after the term was first coined. 'We'll never have randomised control trials - they would be illegal and unethical. But we now have the proof for obesogens and obesity.' The obesogen paradigm has not been taken up by mainstream researchers so far. But Prof Barbara Corkey, at Boston University School of Medicine and past president of the Obesity Society, said: 'The initial worldview was that obesity is caused by eating too much and exercising too little. And this is nonsense. 'It's not the explanation because all of the creatures on Earth, including humans, eat when they're hungry and stop when they are full. Every cell in the body knows if you have enough food,' she said. 'Something has disrupted that normal sensing apparatus and it is not volition. 'People who are overweight and obese go to tremendous extremes to lose weight and the diet industry has fared extremely well,' Corky said. 'We've learned that doesn't work. When the medical profession doesn't understand something, we always blame patients and unfortunately, people are still being held responsible for [obesity].' Lustig said: 'Gluttony and sloth are just the outward manifestations of these biochemical perturbations that are going on beneath the surface.' How much of the obesity pandemic may be caused by obesogens is not known, though Heindel said they will have an 'important role'. Lustig said: 'If I had to guess, based on all the work and reading I've done, I would say obesogens will account for about 15% to 20% of the obesity epidemic. But that's a lot.' The rest he attributes to processed food diets, which themselves contain some obesogens. 'Fructose is a primary driver of a lot of this,' he said. 'It partitions energy to fat in the liver and is a prime obesogen. Fructose would cause obesity even if it didn't have calories.' A small 2021 trial found that an ultra-processed diet caused more weight gain than an unprocessed diet, despite containing the same calories. Cutting exposure to obesogens is difficult, given that there are now 350,000 synthetic chemicals, many of which are pervasive in the environment. But those known to be harmful can be removed from sale, as is happening in Europe. Heindel said prospective mothers in particular could adjust what they eat and monitor what their children play with in their early years: 'Studies have shown modifying diets can within a week or so cause a significant drop in several obesogens.' Lustig said: 'This cause is very pervasive and pernicious, and it's also lucrative to a lot of [chemical] companies. But we must address it rationally.' To do that, the 'knowledge gap' among doctors, regulators and policymakers must be addressed, the scientists said. 'It's time now that [obesity researchers and clinicians] should start paying attention and, if they don't think the data is strong enough, tell us what more to do,' said Heindel, who is organising a conference to tackle this issue. Corkey is yet to be fully convinced by the obesogen paradigm, but said the concept of an environmental toxin is probably the right direction to go in. 'Is there proof? No, there is not,' she said. 'It's a very difficult problem, because the number of chemicals in our environment has just astronomically increased. 'But there's no alternative hypothesis that to me makes any sense and I would certainly challenge anyone who has a better, testable idea to come forth with it,' she said. 'Because this is a serious problem that is impacting our societies enormously, especially children. The problems are getting worse, not better - we're going in the wrong direction as it stands.'", "d3e05ee389cc7d27f584f06cd35424b247d4de39b31534db80e8c512": "Canada says it will ban Huawei and ZTE from the country's 5G network, a move that puts it in line with intelligence-sharing allies, but risks further chilling relations with China. The federal government made the announcement on Thursday afternoon after signalling for months it intended to block China's flagship telecommunications companies from accessing 5G networks in Canada. 'We'll take any actions necessary to safeguard our telecommunications infrastructure,' said the innovation minister, Francois-Philippe Champagne. Telecoms providers who already have equipment from the firms must remove it - and Champagne said there would be no compensation provided by the federal government. Canadian telecom companies have spent nearly had C$700m (US$546m) on Huawei equipment over the years, largely on 4G or LTE equipment. The rest of the Five Eyes network - the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand - have already banned Huawei equipment. The public safety minister, Marco Mendicino, called the move a 'necessary step' amid growing scepticism of Beijing's trustworthiness. For years, Canada has faced growing pressure from allies, most notably the United States, to ban Huawei's 5G equipment over fears it could compromise national security. In 2018, Canada said it would review any possible concerns posed by adopting the technology. But any decision was delayed after Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada on a US warrant. In a move widely seen as retaliatory, China arrested two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, later charging the men with espionage. The long-running dispute came to an end after a British Columbia court ordered Meng released. China freed the two Canadians hours later. As the standoff dragged on, relations between the two countries soured. While China recently lifted a ban on Canadian canola imports which had last for years, a sign of thawing relations, it is unclear how Thursday's decision will affect ties between the two nations. Chinese government officials had previously warned a ban on telecoms infrastructure could prompt retaliatory measures.", "a9b454473c08bb3a2bb47b26c8b8a8729189818f44d99f6801baff48": "A 911 dispatcher has been placed on administrative leave and will probably be fired after allegedly hanging up on a Tops supermarket employee during Saturday's shooting rampage in Buffalo, New York, where a white supremacist allegedly killed 10 people. Latisha Rogers, an assistant office manager at the Tops supermarket, said she called 911 and whispered quietly into the phone about the shooter, who was already in the store. 'I called 911, I go through the whole operator and everything, the dispatcher comes on and I'm whispering to her and I said 'Miss, please send help to 1275 Jefferson - there is a shooter in the store,'' Rogers told WGRZ. 'She proceeded in a very nasty tone and says, 'I can't hear you, why are you whispering? You don't have to whisper, they can't hear you.' So I continued to whisper and I said 'Ma'am he's still in the store, he's still shooting! I'm scared for my life, please send help!' Out of nervousness, my phone fell out of my hand, she said something I couldn't make out, and then the phone hung up,' Rogers said. In a separate interview with Buffalo News, Rogers said, 'She got mad at me, hung up in my face.' Rogers said she proceeded to call her boyfriend whom she instructed to call 911. 'I felt that lady left me to die yesterday,' she added. On Wednesday, Erie county executive Mark Poloncarz said that the dispatcher had been placed on administrative leave and may have her employment terminated at the end of the month. 'The individual was put on administrative leave pending a hearing which will be held on May 30 in which our intention is to terminate the 911 call taker, who acted totally inappropriately not following protocol,' Poloncarz said. He did not publicly identify the dispatcher, who has been on the job for eight years. Further investigation into the shooting has revealed that Payton Gendron, the 18-year- old suspect, had been plotting the massacre in a series of online statements over the past five months. The Washington Post found that he had made plans as early as December to murder those he regarded as 'replacers' - a reference to the racist conspiracy that open immigration policies and high birthrates for Black people are being promoted to displace white voters. After Saturday's shooting, New York governor Kathy Hochul unveiled a 'comprehensive' plan on Wednesday to combat domestic terror and gun violence. She described the attack as 'a wake-up call' and included new anti-terrorism measures in her plan, including the requirement of state police to file an 'extreme risk protection' order under New York's 'red flag law' when there is credible reason to believe a person could seriously harm themselves or others. 'We as a country are facing an intersection of two crises: the mainstreaming of hate speech - including white nationalism, racism and white supremacy - and the easy access to military-style weapons and magazines,' Hochul said, adding that the measures were implemented to address 'one of the most pressing threats to public safety across the United States'.", "1f1192aa298813b33d9f71179e2dc6ff3dbc15d72925c2b2340e0e9a": "It was little more than a year ago that US officials were publicly rubbishing the prospect of engagement with Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, who they described as a 'dictator'. 'His repression, corruption and mismanagement have generated one of the most dire humanitarian crises this hemisphere has seen,' the state department spokesperson, Ned Price, declared in February 2021. 'We certainly don't expect any contact with Maduro anytime soon.' Yet 2022 appears to have heralded a new dawn for Washington-Caracas ties, as geopolitical shifts caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and political deadlock in the economically devastated South American country prompt a major policy rethink from members of Joe Biden's administration - and offer Venezuela's authoritarian leader a once improbable political lifeline. On Tuesday, the US announced a gentle easing of the economic sanctions it has spent years using to push for political change in Venezuela - including against a nephew of its first lady - a move senior members of Maduro's government celebrated. 'Venezuela hopes that these decisions by the United States of America will pave the way to the total lifting of the illegal sanctions which affect our entire people,' the country's vice-president, Delcy Rodriguez, tweeted in English as the news emerged. Simultaneously, her brother, another top Chavista called Jorge Rodriguez, shared a photograph of himself shaking hands with the chief negotiator for Venezuela's opposition, Gerardo Blyde, signalling the reactivation of stalled talks designed to bridge the country's toxic political schism. 'Congratulations!' tweeted Marcelo Ebrard, the foreign minister of Mexico, where those negotiations were happening until their suspension last October after the extradition of the Maduro ally Alex Saab to the US. Some see Washington's change of heart as a direct consequence of Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine. In March, days after Russia's onslaught began, senior US officials flew to Caracas for their first encounter with Maduro representatives in years. That visit was partly motivated by a US desire to increase oil production in Venezuela - which boasts the world's largest proven reserves - in order to restrain global oil prices, which have soared as a result of Putin's war. Christopher Sabatini, a Chatham House Latin America expert, said the war in Ukraine had also prompted a rethink in Caracas, which desperately needed new markets for its oil as well as access to western refineries, banking systems and investment. 'It's true that oil prices have gone up with Russia's invasion of Ukraine but, because of sanctions, Russia is now increasing the sale of its oil to China, which was Venezuela's principal market,' he added. Yet Sabatini believed Washington's shift had been planned well before Putin's invasion and reflected the US's realization that the Trump-era 'maximum pressure' policy - by which harsh sanctions were used to try to topple Maduro and replace him with the young opposition leader Juan Guaido - had failed. 'It is a demonstration that the US and much of the international community bet on a solution that simply hasn't worked,' Sabatini said. 'That's anathema to some people in the US Congress. It's anathema to some elements of the Venezuelan opposition who always hoped and dreamed for some sort of cathartic collapse of the government and the fleeing of Maduro and his cronies. But clearly Maduro has hung on, [albeit] at a huge cost to his country ... and now the US has to [engage].' Representatives of Venezuela's mainstream opposition, and the rival government Guaido created when his campaign to unseat Maduro started in January 2019, now accept dealing with their foe is the only way forwards as the country heads towards its next scheduled presidential election in 2024. Speaking to the Guardian during a recent tour of Europe, Guaido's deputy foreign minister, Isadora Zubillaga, admitted: 'The reality is that we must talk. We were not able to wipe them out and they were not able to wipe us out either. That negotiation process must include discussion of the lifting of sanctions and penalties.' However, Zubillaga warned the west against boosting what she called a Putin-led autocratic coalition by offering too many concessions to Maduro. 'The Maduro regime is sustained by the international alliance, including countries like Iran, Russia, Cuba and China. If Maduro is helped, so is Putin,' Zubillaga said. A senior US administration official said that it would calibrate its sanctions policy depending on the behaviour of Maduro's administration and whether 'ambitious, concrete and irreversible' steps towards free and democratic elections were achieved at talks. Members of the US right denounced the loosening of sanctions, which include allowing limited contact between the US oil giant Chevron and Venezuela's government. 'Biden continues his effort to appease anti-American communist dictators,' tweeted the Republican senator Marco Rubio, one of the cheerleaders for Trump's bungled anti-Maduro drive. A Wall Street Journal editorial slammed Biden's 'dance with a Latin dictator'. Others expressed cautious optimism that, while there would be no overnight solutions to Venezuela's profound economic, humanitarian and political crises, the return of negotiations - and incentives for Maduro and others around him to offer concessions - was a step towards a democratic transition. Geoff Ramsey, the director for Venezuela at the Washington Office on Latin America, said: 'The only feasible transition is a pacted transition which is going to require some level of negotiations with political, military and economic elites. 'What we are seeing is a recognition of that reality. I don't think that means that the US or other actors of the international community are ignorant or naive about the difficulties that lie ahead,' he added. 'If the problem in Venezuela were simply a lack of dialogue we would have seen the crisis solved years ago.'", "b99eee4f17bda2fdc0fbbe9e18d3119e2c4abfdd5ddb7226781ea6dd": "The abrupt resignation of Alberta's premier has shocked the western province and raised questions about the ideological direction of Canada's conservative movement amid a surge in far-right and populist influences. Jason Kenney announced late on Wednesday that he was leaving the province's top job after barely surviving a leadership review. A slim majority of party members - 51.4% - had voted in favour of keeping him in power but Kenney said that support wasn't enough to justify remaining head of the governing United Conservatives. 'The result is not what I hoped for or frankly what I expected,' Kenney told supporters. The premier had previously said he would view any result above 50% as a win. 'He had seemed so doggedly determined to remain on his leader ... with even a single vote more than those who voted against him,' said Lori Williams, a professor of political science at Calgary's Mount Royal University. 'So his decision was very much a surprise.' Once a star cabinet minister under former prime minister Stephen Harper, Kenney returned to Alberta to unite warring conservative factions and oust the governing leftwing New Democratic Party. He won a strong majority in 2019, but his tenure was marred by party infighting and threats of mutiny. His pugilistic brand of politics won him allies but also created a growing list of enemies and disaffected party members. 'It takes a truly extraordinary leader to try to persuade people who may dislike and disrespect one another to work together for the sake of governance,' said Williams, pointing out the only Canada politician able to effectively take on this challenge was Harper.  Kenney's popularity cratered during the coronavirus pandemic as he fought off criticism from within his own party amid fierce debates over public health measures. Rightwing elements were angered by restrictions on businesses and movement, but more moderate party members feared an overwhelmed health care system. At one point during the pandemic, Alberta had one of the highest coronavirus infection rates in North America. As the debate intensified over who should speak for the party, the premier warned in March that conservative movement was being overrun by far-right 'lunatics ... trying to take over the asylum'. But turning on his own party probably accelerated challenges to his leadership, say former supporters. Rick Bell, political columnist at the Calgary Sun and longtime advocate of the outgoing premier, wrote that the fall of Kenney was 'stunning' but expected. 'He never listened. Never. He was right. We all were wrong. Until we were right,' wrote Bell. Even though the province has lifted its public health restrictions and significant revenue from oil and gas is flowing into the provincial treasury, voters seem unwilling to forgive Kenney. Kenney joins a growing list of conservative premiers unable to finish out their term: since 2004, Alberta has seen seven premiers. Only one - New Democrat Rachel Notley - served a full term. But Kenney's departure amid bitter infighting over the ideological direction of the party, will loom over the current race for a federal Conservative leader. The national party has already turfed two of their leaders in recent years, Erin O'Toole and Andrew Scheer, both of whom campaigned to the right and then tried to woo centrist voters in a general election. 'There's almost competing imperatives facing a leader of a coalition Conservative party. One is to win the support of their own caucus - and the other is to win an election by appealing to a broader range of electors,' said Williams. 'But neither really seems compatible.' A federal Liberal from Alberta called the recent resignations a 'disturbing trend' among his political rivals. 'The conservative movement in this country is heading to a dark place. And I find that very troubling,' Randy Boissonnault told reporters on Thursday. As conservatives in Alberta grapple with their party's future, Williams sees a difficult and unenviable task for the eventual leader. 'You really have to wonder who would want to take this on. Who would want to risk their reputation and their political future on the challenges we're seeing boiling up within this party?'", "0d7077ccdd58f6886fd3585790fd2229197808fdbc42de010df60f4b": "Vladimir Putin 'had to keep explaining things' to Donald Trump when Trump was US president, the former White House aide Fiona Hill said. 'Putin doesn't like to do that,' Hill told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. 'You could see that he got frustrated many times with President Trump. Even though he loves to be able to spin his own version of events, he wants to have predictability in the person that he's engaging with.' Under Trump, Hill was senior director for European and Russian affairs on the national security council. She is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. The British-born adviser come to prominence when she testified in Trump's first impeachment for withholding military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to extract political dirt on opponents including Joe Biden. Putin ordered the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February. Bloody fighting continues. Biden has committed to supporting Ukraine. At the Chicago event, Hill said Putin 'thought that somebody like Biden, who's a trans-Atlanticist, who knows all about Nato, who actually knows where Ukraine is, and actually knows something about the history, and is very steeped in international affairs, would be the right person to engage with as opposed to somebody that you have to explain everything to all the time, honestly'. The Russian president, Hill said, might still be 'waiting for us to sue for peace, [to] negotiate away Ukraine'. Trump and Republicans claim Putin would not have invaded if Trump was in power. The Trump administration was dogged by investigations of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. Trump was seen to be too close to Putin. Flashpoints included a Helsinki summit in July 2018 when the two leaders met alone but for translators and Trump said he believed Putin over his own intelligence services regarding election interference. Hill was a co-author of a well-received book on Putin. Last year, promoting a memoir, There Is Nothing for You Here, she told the BBC that in Helsinki she considered faking a medical emergency to interrupt Trump's remarks. 'My initial thought was just 'How can I end this?'' she said. Trump has attacked Hill publicly, calling her 'a deep state stiff - with a nice accent'. In April, after Hill compared him to Putin, Trump told the New York Times: 'She doesn't know the first thing she's talking about. If she didn't have the accent she would be nothing.' Regarding Putin's view of Trump, in 2020 Hill told the Guardian: 'Trump just wants to sit down with the guy, whoever it is, and create personal chemistry and then everyone else works out the details. He wanted to treat Putin the way he treated Xi [Jinping of China] or [Benjamin] Netanyahu [of Israel]. He wanted to be able to pick up the phone and talk to them. 'Putin doesn't operate like that. Putin takes translators with him for every occasion. The Russians are incredibly organised. They take advantage of every opportunity, every vulnerability, every open door they can walk through.'", "b76fb3e385a431e3ce053625a1db6d3d7a9c5303f9e9e7d2c34f1411": "Afghanistan's Taliban rulers have ordered all female TV presenters to cover their faces on air, the country's biggest media outlet has said. The order came in a statement from the Taliban's virtue and vice ministry, tasked with enforcing the group's rulings, as well as from the information and culture ministry, the Tolo news channel tweeted on Thursday. The statement called the order 'final and non-negotiable', the channel said. The statement was sent to the Moby Group, which owns Tolo and several other TV and radio networks. The tweet said it was being applied to other Afghan media as well. A local media official confirmed his station had received the order and was told it was not up for discussion. He said the station had no other option. He spoke on the condition that he and his station not be identified for fear of problems with the authorities. Several female anchors and presenters posted their photos on social media showing themselves with their faces covered with face masks while they presented programmes. One prominent Tolo presenter, Yalda Ali, posted a video of herself putting on a face mask with a caption: 'A woman being erased, on orders from the virtue and vice ministry.' On one station, Shamshad TV, implementation of the order was mixed. One female anchor appeared with a face mask on Thursday, while another later in the day went without, showing her face. During the Taliban's first stint in power from 1996 to 2001, they imposed overwhelming restrictions on women, requiring them to wear the all-encompassing burqa that even covered the eyes with a mesh and barring them from public life and education. After they seized power again in Afghanistan in August last year, the Taliban initially appeared to have moderated somewhat their restrictions, not announcing a dress code for women. But in recent weeks, they have taken a sharp, hardline pivot that has confirmed the worst fears of rights activists. Earlier this month, the Taliban ordered all women in public to wear head-to-toe clothing that leaves only their eyes visible. The decree said women should leave the home only when necessary and that male relatives would face punishment for women's dress code violations, starting with a summons and escalating to court hearings and jail time. The Taliban also issued a decree barring girls from attending school after the sixth grade, reversing previous promises by Taliban officials that girls of all ages would be allowed an education.", "28e3c4231c071eaad2c8c61dd933154ce096afebafb03757c5197f6e": "", "c6600b20e27fee7f81ad4fc1744f2ae107c8fcd85c110ab086a7d1ec": "Oklahoma's Republican-led legislature passed the nation's strictest abortion ban on Thursday. The bill, if signed into law, would allows citizens to sue anyone, anywhere who 'aids or abets' a patient in terminating a pregnancy. The bill bans abortion from conception, even before an egg implants in the uterus, and would go into effect immediately if signed by Republican governor, Kevin Stitt. Abortion providers expect he will do so before the coming week. Like a six-week abortion ban in Texas, Oklahoma's bill would be enforced by citizens. It would allow anyone, anywhere to sue for $10,000 and 'emotional distress', even if they do not have a relationship to the patient in question. Oklahoma's bill, 'is not one more ban, it is not another ban - it is a first,' said Emily Wales, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which serves patients in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The law, 'encourages bounty hunters to sue their neighbors', and is a 'reversal of history happening before our eyes'. The bill is part of an aggressive push in Republican-led states across the country to scale back abortion rights. 'It's outrageous, and it's just the latest in a series of extreme laws from around the country,' Vice-President Kamala Harris said in reaction to the law. She said the new bans were designed to 'punish and control women'. It comes on the heels of an unprecedented leaked draft opinion from the supreme court, which suggested a majority of conservative justices support a total reversal of Roe v Wade. The landmark decision legalized abortion nearly 50 years ago and invalidated dozens of state abortion bans. A final ruling in a key case from Mississippi, called Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, is expected next month. If the final decision does not change substantially from the leaked draft, the court would in effect return the issue of legal abortion to the states. At least 26 states would be certain or likely to ban abortion. The leaked opinion sparked uproar from Americans who support abortion access, a roughly two-thirds majority according to polls, and human rights leaders. The Oklahoma bill promoted by Collinsville Republican representative Wendi Stearman would prohibit all abortions in the state, except to save the life of a pregnant woman or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest that has been reported to law enforcement. 'Is our goal to defend the right to life or isn't it?' Stearman asked her colleagues before the bill passed on a 73-16 vote mostly along party lines. At least one lawmaker suggested the bill did not go far enough, and suggested also banning treatment for ectopic pregnancies, a life-threatening medical condition in which an embryo implants inside the fallopian tubes. An ectopic pregnancy is never viable. 'These people have no idea what they're talking about, and they are making laws controlling our medical practice and people's basic rights,' said Dr Iman Alsaden, medical director of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. The bill is one of at least three abortion bans sent to Stitt this year. The other laws include a six-week abortion ban and a criminal abortion ban, though the way the laws will interact is not yet known. The criminal abortion ban, set to take effect this summer if Roe falls, would make it a felony to perform an abortion punishable by up to 10 years in prison, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The lead attorney on challenges to Oklahoma's various abortion bans, Rabia Muqaddam from the Center for Reproductive Rights, called the legislature 'extraordinarily sloppy'. 'My understanding is the most restrictive law that takes effect latest controls, but it is extraordinarily bizarre,' said Muqaddam. 'We're challenging everything as it comes.' The laws passed by Oklahoma also have an outsized effect on women in Texas, the state which pioneered civil enforcement of abortion bans. Oklahoma was briefly a haven state for Texan patients, after the supreme court allowed Texas to ban abortion at six weeks in 2021 September. 'At this point, we are preparing for the most restrictive environment politicians can create: a complete ban on abortion with likely no exceptions,' said Wales. 'It's the worst-case scenario for abortion care in the state of Oklahoma,' she added.", "5b4125ca4aa6b472dd18fc443a99a0171d29f60215ad8a4abaef231a": "Civil servants and special advisers have reacted with fury and disbelief after Scotland Yard confirmed Boris Johnson got only one of 126 fines levied for law-breaking parties at the heart of Downing Street and Whitehall. The Metropolitan police came under intense pressure to explain how it reached its conclusions after Downing Street said officers confirmed no further action would be taken against the prime minister despite him attending gatherings for which others were fined. The Met's four-month PS460,000 investigation has concluded, paving the way for the publication of a full report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray next week. Her preliminary report found 'failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office'. A former Met chief said the force was open to claims it had bungled the investigation unless it took steps to explain itself. Brian Paddick, now a Liberal Democrat peer, said: 'The Met has no defence to the accusation that it gave the prime minister one fixed-penalty notice (FPN) as that was the minimum he could be fined, but did not do so for other events for political reasons,' he said. 'The decision not to explain is a mistake. It was a mistake not to investigate in the first place. They said there was no need to investigate and then they issued 126 fines, which is not good for their credibility.' The 126 fines were issued to 83 people - 35 men and 48 women - with at least one person receiving five FPNs, the Met said. The fines, typically PS50, covered events held on eight separate dates. Officials who were among those fined were struggling to understand how Johnson could have escaped further censure. He, his wife, Carrie, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, received one fine each for celebrating the prime minister's birthday in June 2020 when indoor gatherings, except for work purposes, were banned. One Whitehall source pointed out that junior civil servants had received FPNs for going to at least one event which the prime minister not only attended but also gave a speech at. Another said: 'It's the twentysomethings I feel sorry for - who went to events that were their seniors' leaving bashes and things.' A former No 10 staffer said during the Covid pandemic it was usual for Johnson to wander over to officials sharing a drink while praising them for 'letting off steam'. One official said another source of resentment was the fact that evidence presented in good faith to Gray by junior officials was handed to police, while more senior figures declined to cooperate. 'Some people worry that they ended up being penalised because, before the police were even involved, they tried to help with the report, when others who stood back maybe got away with it.' There is widespread anger at the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, who was described by one Whitehall insider as a 'submarine' who had offered no leadership or counsel throughout the crisis. 'People trusted their bosses and they got fined, you'd think someone might acknowledge that at some stage,' they said. Some officials believe Case should have shouldered part of the blame for the culture that developed in No 10 during lockdowns - and as the most senior civil servant, should have spoken up for junior staffers caught up in the inquiry. Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect union representing civil servants, said: 'The scale of these breaches of the law is clearly symptomatic of a deeply damaged culture at the heart of Downing Street. Ministers in this government are far too quick to blame officials when it is they who are responsible for taking the lead when it comes to setting that culture.' Civil servants were contacted on Wednesday by a cabinet official liaising with the Met, who acknowledged it was a 'challenging time' and warned that a 'small number' of the 126 fines remain to be issued in the coming days. Johnson is not expected to give his own response to the completion of the Met's investigation until Gray publishes her full report. Officials say it remains possible the final report could include photographs used as evidence but these are unlikely to be of parties in progress, or show individuals. A decision also had yet to be made on naming any individuals involved, although if this happened, it would only be for people at senior grades. A source said the report, which was being updated before being sent to lawyers, would be sober in tone: 'I don't think there will be any salacious details not heard before. It will be quite dry, but it will set out the facts, and people can assess those as they choose.' Conservative backbenchers who previously called for Johnson's removal say next week will be a moment of truth for colleagues who have withheld judgment about his fate. 'If Gray's report is published next week, they're going to run out of road, and they're going to have to make a decision.' Meanwhile the Met will face further questions about its handling of the investigation, said Len Duvall, the leader of the Labour group on the London assembly. 'I think the police and crime committee will want to ask questions and understand how the Met have reached their conclusions about the prime minister only getting one fine,' he said. 'I think from the information in the public domain, he [Johnson] has got away lightly. It is for the police to justify why there was just one fine.' The Met's acting deputy commissioner, Helen Ball, said the fines were issued for the breaches after detectives scoured more than 500 photos plus emails, CCTV, and door logs to see who was where and when. 'Our view is that these 126 referrals are clearcut. We made sure after a really thorough investigation that clear evidence existed of a breach,' she said.", "76e9413efe151fc309bc2deebd2db366acb121090c7fd055379e2f2b": "The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack revealed on Thursday that it had evidence to suggest certain 'reconnaissance tours' took place in the days before 6 January, potentially providing some rioters with a layout of the complex. The panel said in a letter requesting cooperation from Georgia Republican congressman Barry Loudermilk that he gave a tour the day before the Capitol attack. The startling disclosure resurrects a contentious line of inquiry that connects House Republicans to the insurrection. 'Based on our review of evidence in the select committee's possession, we believe you have information regarding a tour you led through parts of the Capitol complex on Jan 5, 2021,' said a letter from Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the select committee, and the vice chair Liz Cheney. The select committee noted in the letter to Loudermilk that Republicans on the House administration committee that reviewed security camera footage of the Capitol before January 6 recently claimed there were no tours or large groups or anyone wearing Maga caps. 'However, the select committee's review of evidence directly contradicts that denial,' Thompson and Cheney wrote. The request for voluntary cooperation from Loudermilk indicates the panel has been quietly focused on one of the unexplained mysteries of 6 January: how certain supporters of Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol appeared to know in advance the layout of the Capitol complex. Some of the offices and ceremonial spaces in the Capitol - such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office - are marked and easy to locate. But Democrats raised concerns after 6 January that some rioters were able to locate hideaway offices and the underground tunnel network. The concerns led to 34 House Democrats seeking an investigation into the alleged reconnaissance tours that took place on 5 January 2021, which prompted a review of security camera footage by the House administration committee, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Democrats on the House administration committee turned over some of that footage to the US attorney for the District of Columbia, which is prosecuting January 6 seditious conspiracy and obstruction of Congress cases, the sources said. But the top Republican on that committee said in February that some of his members had reviewed the footage and said in a separate letter that 'it does not support these repeated Democrat accusations about so-called 'reconnaissance' tours'. In a twist, Loudermilk filed an ethics complaint last May against Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and other Democrats who alleged GOP members had given such tours. 'No Republican member of Congress led any kind of 'reconnaissance' tours through the Capitol, proven by security footage captured by the US Capitol police,' Loudermilk said as part of his complaint that urged the House ethics committee to investigate Sherrill. The select committee investigating 6 January events reached a different conclusion, Thompson and Cheney wrote, and identified Loudermilk as among the members who provided tours the day before the Capitol attack - at a time when congressional Covid-19 rules prohibited such tours.", "385ccda3f8c29ad59b92cb5187ed819d5211603127083c693d108177": "", "7fdd8137f8a818f42852a64fa93394938cf75584a013ea883bb641f6": "", "733b2ecfe922d5ed525466553440c0357bea963e1c3f9d7023f00730": "", "6573965f46b148bf2b1484e27e9d93dc338698435d6725978d41372b": "Zahra Bei had been working as a teacher in London schools for almost two decades when she began to see education in a new light. She started her career as a business studies teacher in a secondary school and was quickly promoted to head of department. She loved teaching, she loved the kids, but as time went on she began to notice changes. Bei had come to London alone at the age of 16, leaving her Somali-born mother at home in Italy. She went to college, studied for a BTec, got herself into university, then did a PGCE and started teaching. It was a massive personal achievement and she felt 'really proud' of herself. The job was demanding, the hours were long and Bei was also raising a young son, but as the years went by she detected a shift in the way pupils - and staff - were being managed. 'We started to see behaviour policies beginning to clamp down. You'd have a long corridor of kids, sitting in isolation at these tables, bored out of their heads,' she said. Schools in England have increasingly adopted so-called zero-tolerance policies, where breaches of the school's behavioural code can result in children being taken out of class and put in a separate area where they work alone, in silence, away from their peers. Critics say isolation can be damaging, not only for a child's education but also their emotional wellbeing. Supporters say such measures are vital to ensure the rest of the class can learn without disruption. But for Bei her school was starting to seem more like a corporation, rather than the community one she'd joined. 'You just feel like, well, this is not what I signed up for. And I remember that I gave in my notice overnight, without another job to go to.' It was the beginning of Bei's journey towards No More Exclusions (NME), a community-based movement with a focus on racial justice in education, which she helped found in 2018. Its mission is to highlight the persistent race disparity in school exclusions and end the policy of excluding children from England's schools, while also developing anti-racist teacher training and curriculum principles. Since Bei first began to notice those changes in schools, exclusion rates in England - both temporary and permanent - have risen sharply. Permanent exclusions in England rose from 5,082 in 2010/11 to 7,894 in 2018/19, while even in 2019/20, during Covid and lockdown, schools still managed to exclude 5,057 children. Fixed-term exclusions, or suspensions, reached a 13-year high in 2018/19 with a total of 438,265, dropping to 310,733 as a result of the pandemic disruption. The racial disparities are stark, with exclusion rates for black Caribbean students up to six times higher than those of their white peers in some local authorities, according to a recent Guardian analysis. Though many in the education sector are worried about exclusions, NME's position is more radical than most who argue that some exclusions will always be necessary in the most extreme cases. Bei began to work with children outside mainstream schools in 2007, first at a 'new arrivals centre', mainly for refugee children from Afghanistan, Yemeni and Romania, but also accommodating a few local children at risk of exclusion. Today it would be called an alternative provision setting that caters for children who, for a variety of reasons, cannot attend mainstream school.  'These are the kids that nobody wants to teach,' said Bei. Many were year 11 teenagers that schools were reluctant to take on as they would bring down GCSE results. 'As a migrant myself, I felt a connection with these children,' she said. She stayed three years before moving on to a pupil referral unit (PRU), for children who have either been excluded from mainstream education or are at risk of being excluded. Many of the children in the PRU were black, with undiagnosed special educational needs and disabilities. Many were unable to read or write properly and they felt the shame and stigma of it. 'Yes, the behaviour was challenging. There were definitely chairs flying - and that's not a metaphor. But there was something that kept me there,' said Bei, who taught business, citizenship and Spanish.  'There was a lot of angst among the kids. Like, 'I'm a reject'. I recognised it and I was like: 'Well I'm not buying your bullshit, I can see through it, and I'm not letting you go.' And I know that even though they pretended that they didn't give a shit about school, they did care. 'A lot of the kids I taught at the PRU were definitely neurodiverse, but those needs weren't being addressed as such. Instead we had the behaviour route. As many as 80% of them - maybe more - were dyslexic, autistic, dyspraxic, and needed extra help with reading but didn't get it. And so we failed them, and we continue to fail them.' She stayed 10 years but in that time began to question the role of PRUs, and whether children should even be there. 'It was like a holding pen,' she said. 'It was my 17th or 18th year as a teacher and I'm a little bit ashamed to say it was probably the first time that I'd really looked at education in a critical way, through a social justice lens. 'It took time for the penny to drop and for me to go - what about their human rights? What about their access to science labs, to a gym, to counsellors? All the things that mainstream kids would have?' There was a restructuring at the PRU and Bei left to study for a master's in social justice and education at the Institute of Education at University College London. She has been fighting racism and social injustice in education ever since. She is now working on her PhD and her studies have informed the efforts of NME, which was set up around her kitchen table, with the help of some of her former students who had experienced the injustice of the education system first-hand. 'I just got fed up with hearing about my students ending up in prison or dead,' said Bei. 'I'm not shying away from the realities. Their realities are very harsh. Schools are a protective factor in children and young people's lives. You remove the protective factor and you are exposing them to all manner of risks.' She cites the case of Tashaun Aird, 15, who was killed in Hackney, London, in 2019 after being permanently excluded and sent to alternative provision. 'What we have got at the moment is not working. Can we at least agree it does not work?' Thanks to the work of NME, among others, the issue of exclusions and the damage they cause has risen up the education agenda, and there is growing pressure for change from parents, teachers, unions and public figures, including former children's commissioner for England Anne Longfield. As well as raising awareness and campaigning for a change in the law on exclusions, NME also signposts sources of advice and advocacy for families affected by exclusion.  'Sadly, we get emails every week from desperate parents,' said Bei. 'And when I say desperate I mean desperate - saying, 'My child has been excluded, my child has been put in isolation. I have to go into a meeting and I don't know how to talk to these people. I feel the decision has already been made.' Since Child Q,' she adds, 'the floodgates have opened.' In March, it emerged that a 15-year-old girl, known only as Child Q, had been strip-searched during her period by police who were called to a Hackney school after teachers claimed they could smell cannabis. For many, the incident was indicative of the racism affecting black pupils in England's schools. For Bei it exposed the way in which schools can end up colluding with criminalisation and carcerality. 'A lot of us can't process the rage,' she says. She's worried about police in schools, about schools abdicating their safeguarding responsibilities and the adultification of black children. 'The decision I've made, personally, is that I will not be in the classroom for as long as things don't change. I'm almost in a self-imposed exile. What we want to see is accountability and we want to see change.'", "b4cdf0aad01e8f979e4da667de46ca9a20c0ae73b4f5ec77d0c54687": "Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took a break between visiting Amazon union workers and endorsing progressive candidates to get engaged to her longtime partner Riley Roberts. Ocasio-Cortez, 32, confirmed to Insider on Thursday that she and Roberts, who met while both were at Boston University, got engaged last month while visiting her parents' home town in Puerto Rico. She then wrote on Twitter: 'It's true! Thank you all for the well wishes.' According to Insider, the pair were quiet about their relationship even before Ocasio-Cortez became a popular political voice, and their friends at university did not always know they were together. Roberts has also been one of her greatest support systems throughout her career, according to a biography published earlier this year, People magazine reported. 'What we do know about Roberts doesn't fit the stereotype of a politician's partner,' writes Josh Gondelman in an essay in Take Up Space: The Unprecedented AOC by the editors of New York magazine. 'He doesn't seem focus-grouped or media-trained for state dinners and press conferences. We know he's supportive and encouraging in private,' Gondelman writes. 'And his expertise, as far as his public image goes, is his elusiveness and restraint.' The few times Roberts, a marketing professional, has popped up in media it has been with the couple's dog, Deco, or in the 2018 documentary Knock Down the House.

Dolphins definitely do: they are known for being clever, playful, tactile animals, and they like to rub against rough surfaces, nap in coral beds and soak on sponges like guests at an underwater spa. However, dolphins may be getting more from their bath scrubs than just relaxation and leisure. A study published today suggests that bottlenose dolphins may be self-medicating their skin ailments with the help of corals, adding to growing research on their previously unexplored medicinal properties. 'It's very intensive,' said Angela Ziltener, one of the study's lead authors, of the behaviour of the dolphins with particular corals. 'They don't just go through [the coral] - they go up, they come back down again and they rub their belly, their ventral area and the back.' Dolphins have thick, smooth and resilient skin, but can be prone to skin conditions such as yeast and bacterial infections, scars or tattoo-like lesions caused by viral pox infections. These ailments seem to be exacerbated by global heating. Ziltener, a wildlife biologist at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and her team have been surveying a community of 360 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in the northern Red Sea since 2009. They observed that the dolphins often queued up nose-to-tail to rub themselves against corals as soon as they woke up and right before they went to sleep, as if they were showering for the day. As well as a mechanical rub, the dolphins also caused the corals to release a polyp mucus. The team also noticed that the dolphins returned to the same coral species, and appeared to be meticulous in choosing which parts of their body to rub. They ran lab tests on 48 samples of corals, sponges and coral mucus 'chosen' by the dolphins, including the gorgonian coral Rumphella aggregata, the leather coral Sarcophyton sp. and the sponge Ircinia sp. The results, published in the journal iScience, revealed at least 17 different bioactive metabolites with antibacterial, antioxidative and oestrogen-like hormonal properties, all of which could be useful in skin treatments. The compounds are not commonly used in antibiotics for humans or animals, but an expanding body of research shows that some corals and sponges have medicinal properties, including antimicrobial. 'Such metabolites are helpful if you have an infection,' said Gertrud Morlock, an analytical chemist at Justus Liebig University Giessen in Germany, and a lead author of the study. 'If the dolphins have a skin infection, these compounds could have something like a healing property. 'If you think about it, they have no other options. If they have a problem with the skin, what can they do?' The authors note that further research is needed to show which coral's medicinal properties the dolphins need to treat given ailments, and whether these properties have a measurable, positive impact on the cetaceans' health. Learning more about the dolphin's social network and demographic could help with this. Tracking individual dolphins that display the behaviour, and seeing if they have fewer skin diseases or decreased mortality compared with the rest of the group, would make this argument stronger, according to Sarah Powell, a former marine biologist who studies how dolphins transmit their skin diseases but was not involved in the study. Past research has shown that dolphins like to use coral sponges as foraging tools. 'I do not find it to be such a reach that dolphins would utilise corals and other plants in their environment for other purposes,' said Powell.  Stephanie Venn-Watson, a marine biologist who studies health and longevity in dolphins and was also not involved in the research, said: 'Since dolphins are inherently playful and tactile animals who love to rub, it is difficult to be sure that the dolphins are using the corals for medicinal purposes.'  A next step in proving the link would be to show that corals ignored by dolphins lack the same medicinal properties, she said. 'This is a nice science-driven itch to be scratched.'", "4ee64d72741ee4a35b9724dee1b9f45531d4e547e4e7faeeeeefe9e8": "", "f29ee58f2c934c698bf514999a084cfcf786e4dd897ecf72f725ee4b": "", "0bd220804820be596c2f9e3cf76606357619b6730fe90610e812d9b1": "", "5e17adb47365db735847be74126335987974a988d6aa099beaeaeeea": "", "b9c022669301c3a25773c850516588d92a72640403b74c75520179e0": "", "7c7a7211912e0e685f01046d6d996e5c84703120a413091afdfaf7e2": "", "107f543b18652414872550d4574a3e27c83af26791d1cc511359ce42": "", "2d4ecd6d6cfabb1bb2ccdc699328a851fa2cb9799a63b4eeef9d4ae4": "", "d9db25d1f9f42f14af9a3ae7927a425d25f2dc6a7c224e81a1690184": "", "bdbe49cd2b3904f7c1dedd6addd246904522d6bffb29fb3372fd1188": "", "50f6b4da73bf097882c99066b8dbdeb8f58c6be4e2ad9098c8028be7": "", "eeb0977eb4e0062b3c97ec0390b8f45f9350811542d1885146a0bd7b": "", "0613d4366954cc027efed05d40b8937eba8c436a6014ac2fac9e5705": "", "98178f50953561779c4a07f83e279edc08b58a4929868538d0588d68": "", "65faa161e15f6ddff850683bb12b0a44cdc3166592c7ead5c18e1d56": "Standing atop the damaged roof of his house on the main road north from Kharkiv going to villages occupied by Russian forces until a few days ago, Konstantin Kharlamov, 53, had just two hours earlier watched black smoke billow in the distance. His friend Vitaliy, 41, the smell of heavy liquor on his breath, said he also saw the explosion, perhaps just two miles away up Lesya Serdyuka Street in the direction of his home village, Strilecha. The departure of the Russians had three days ago given him the chance to move to a safer district of Kharkiv after two and a half months living under occupation. But he was now cut off because of renewed fighting. The constant background thuds and irregular thunder cracks that filled the air and the jumpy Ukrainian soldiers at the checkpoints amid the burnt-out trees, cars and scattered military detritus offered support to the two men's testimony of unfinished business in Ukraine's second city. Four people were said to have been wounded in strikes around the Shevchenkivskyi region of Kharkiv on Monday and one person was confirmed to have been killed in the liberated northern village of Tsyrkuny. Vladimir Putin's forces are being pushed back, and it may prove to be the case that the Battle of Kharkiv joins the Battle of Kyiv in being a triumphant victory for Ukraine. The US Institute for the Study of War on Friday described it as effectively over and Ukrainian soldiers posted a video on Sunday night of them erecting a new border post at the nearby Russian border as an indication of their growing strength and confidence. 'Mr President, we made it!', they wrote in a Facebook post. But there is also ample evidence in Kharkiv's suburbs that the Russians intend to fight hard to keep some offensive positions around this north-eastern Ukrainian stronghold; their forces remain sufficiently close to pepper the outskirts of the city with artillery fire. The Ukrainian military urged calm when a fertiliser plant was hit on Monday, bellowing out red fumes, which the authorities said were not dangerous to health. Officials from Ukraine's general staff said on Monday that the Russians were focused on 'maintaining positions and preventing the advance of our troops toward the border'. If it is a withdrawal by Russia, it is a fighting one, as the people who have suffered so mightily in Kharkiv are well aware. Vitaliy pointed to the rocket-shaped hole in three walls inside his friend's shattered two-storey home and simply asked, with tears in his eyes: 'When will it all end?' 'Only when Putin is dead,' responded Kharlamov, who moved back into his home three days ago with his wife, Olga, 48. They sleep downstairs amid dust and broken glass. They had been on the roof trying to rainproof it as the weather turned. 'The rocket hit on the 50th day of war, but we had left by then because it was so horrific here,' he said. 'I went to the supermarket one day and a rocket destroyed a house right in front of me. It was hell.' Their home is still without heat, electricity or running water. 'We came back to try to save the rooms from the rain,' Kharlamov said. 'Just look what they have done to us.'", "7af9855d925fd9411cbdd4320d0f534d45b52efeda62cd034d60c4b0": "Elisabeth Borne, the French minister for labour, has been appointed prime minister - the first woman to hold the post in more than 30 years and only the second female prime minister in modern French history. 'I dedicate this nomination to all the little girls in France, to tell them, 'Follow your dreams',' Borne said while taking office. 'Nothing should stop the fight for women's place in our society.' Borne, 61, an engineer with a long career in government ministries, the senior civil service, public administration and state businesses, was chosen by Emmanuel Macron for the difficult task of delivering his complex policy promises at the start of his second term, against a background of rising inflation and the war in Ukraine. Borne is the first French female prime minister since Edith Cresson, who briefly headed the cabinet from May 1991 to April 1992 under the Socialist president Francois Mitterrand. 'It's more than time,' Cresson told BFMTV when asked how it felt to see a second woman head the government. Cresson had warned this weekend that French politics remained 'macho'. A total of 74% of French people said they wanted a female prime minister, according to an Ifop poll this weekend. Macron, whose government had featured equal numbers of women and men, had nonetheless been accused of surrounding himself with a mainly male group of advisers and confidants. Borne's first task is to manage the different political factions of Macron's centrist grouping who need to win a parliamentary majority in elections next month if Macron is to have a free hand for his planned overhaul of pensions and the welfare state. If Macron wins a majority, from this summer, Borne must extend caps on energy prices and introduce further measures to address voters' concerns about making ends meet amid the cost of living crisis. She is then tasked with leading Macron's unpopular plans to push back the pension age from 62 to either 64 or 65, which are expected to spark trade union opposition and street protests. Borne will also be given a new brief of overseeing what Macron has promised will be a radical new form of 'green planning' to limit carbon emissions and boost environment policy. Borne is a faithful Macron supporter who held three key ministerial jobs during his first term: transport, environment and labour. She earned a reputation for taking on difficult policies and pushing them through, including Macron's sweeping reforms to the state rail system, which triggered the biggest strikes in decades. The Macron ally Christophe Castaner had nicknamed the straight-talking Borne 'minister of impossible reforms made possible'. Macron, 44, registered a solid victory in last month's presidential election against the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, winning by 58.5% to Le Pen's 41.5%. But he acknowledged that many French people, particularly on the left, had voted for him to keep out the far right. He has promised to change his top-down, centralised way of doing politics and consult more, broadening his base. Borne, who was in government for the whole of Macron's first term, symbolises continuity. Macron's opponents were quick to attack her appointment. Le Pen, who is running for re-election to parliament, said: 'Emmanuel Macron has shown his incapacity to unite people and the will to continue his politics of looking down on people, deconstructing the state and wrecking the social [security system], of fiscal rackets and laxism.' The radical left's Jean-Luc Melenchon tweeted that Borne's appointment meant 'the continuity of the president's policies'. He tweeted: 'A new season of social and environmental mistreatment begins.' Borne's personal background on the centre left is crucial for Macron, particularly in the run-up to the parliament elections. In his first term, Macron - whose project was described as 'neither right nor left' when he won the presidency in 2017 - had appointed two prime ministers from the right. He is under pressure to win back voters on the centre left in the parliamentary elections. Melenchon recently persuaded the Socialist, Communist and Green parties to enter an alliance under his leadership for the parliamentary elections, that unites the left around a common platform for the first time in decades. The left is seeking to increase its seats in parliament. Borne's long career has included advising key ministers under the Socialist presidents Mitterrand and Francois Hollande as well as working in Paris city hall when it was run by the Socialist Bertrand Delanoe. She never joined the Socialist party, and she is the first of Macron's prime ministers to be a card-carrying member of his centrist party, which was recently renamed Renaissance. Borne has described being personally driven by efficiency, rather than hogging the limelight. 'For me, doing politics is not about getting people to talk about me at any price, it's about dedicating myself to delivering projects in the service of my country,' she told France Inter radio last year. 'Politics is not about pushing myself to the front of stage.'", "04234e7112acf992e2a527091bf744df89afc1c79999cc1158398b98": "The families who gathered in a Spanish cemetery beneath Saturday's burning sun had waited 82 years. They weren't going to let the 30C heat stop them doing what they had come to do. At 11am, Pit 111 of Paterna cemetery in the Valencia region finally gave up the remains of 21 of the 3,400 Republicans who were summarily executed by Franco's forces after the end of the Spanish civil war, and whose bodies were tossed into an enormous and infamous mass grave. Shortly before the remains, which were identified using DNA, were returned to the families of the murdered in a solemn ceremony, a letter was read aloud by Vicenta Juan, secretary of the Pit 111 Association, which has worked to reunite the bodies of the dead with their descendants. In it, one of the victims, German Sanz, said a last goodbye to his wife and children. 'If they kill me, it will be because I didn't think like them and because I served my legally elected government,' it read. 'I'm not afraid of dying, just of leaving you on your own. Forgive me, Rosa, for the sadness my death will cause you. I send a last hug to you, my dear wife, and to you my children. I want you to know that if there really is an afterlife, I'll be waiting for you there. Goodbye forever from your husband and father, German Sanz.' Sanz and his fellow victims were shot between March and May 1940, almost a year after Franco's victory in the Spanish civil war. All of the 150 bodies painstakingly recovered from the seven-metre depths of Pit 111 showed the same treatment, a coup de grace shot to the head. They had lain in the earth of eastern Spain for almost nine decades as the country grappled with the legacy of the coup that brought Franco to power, with his dictatorship, and with political and social disagreements over how best to make peace with the past. Although neither Sanz's remains, nor those of Juan's grandfather, could be identified, others could. Much of the information on where the exhumations were based came from Leoncio Badia, a grave-digger who secretly passed details to the families of those killed. His meticulous record-keeping was vital to Arqueoantro, one of the associations that helps families find their civil war dead. While work to exhume the grave began in May 2020, efforts were badly affected by the pandemic. This weekend, at long last, brought the day for which so many families had prayed. Lina Torres Baena, who was two years old when her father, Amadeo Torres Julian, was shot, wore black and clutched a carnation tied with a ribbon in the colours of the Second Spanish Republic as she received his remains, the pencil he used to write his letters home, and the soles of the shoes he was wearing on 6 April 1940. 'He was 28 when he was shot,' said Lina's daughter, Yolanda. Lina's mother never spoke to her daughter about her father for fear of reprisals. It was only at the end of her life, when she got dementia, that she shared stories about him. 'My mum is one of those who never knew anything about her father,' said Yolanda. 'She's one of the daughters of silence but she's happy to have her father back now and to be able to bury him properly.' Nearby stood the family of Regino Garcia Culebras, a Republican soldier whose murder left behind his wife and six children. 'They arrested my father in 1939 and shot him on 27 March 1940,' said his daughter Rosa. 'They gave him the most summary of trials and then they shot him. By then, we'd already been through a year of misery. We didn't have to look for his remains for years because my mother always knew which grave he was in.' For those who gathered in Paterna on Saturday, the event was as overdue as it was welcome. Eighty-three years after it ended, the civil war and the subsequent dictatorship continue to cause personal pain and political skirmishes. Spain's socialist-led government is hoping to build on landmark legislation from 2007 with a 'democratic memory' bill intended to 'settle Spanish democracy's debt to its past'. Among its 65 articles are plans for a census and a national DNA bank to help locate and identify the remains of the tens of thousands of people who still lie in unmarked graves, a ban on groups that glorify the Franco regime, and a 'redefinition' of the Valley of the Fallen, the hulking mausoleum outside Madrid where the dictator lay for 44 years until his exhumation in 2019. The plans have been criticised by the opposition conservative People's party, which says the proposed legislation will serve only to 'dig up grudges' and churn up the earth that was carefully tamped down with the post-Franco amnesty law and the so-called pact of forgetting. But for many, the recovery of remains is a basic human and democratic right. Clutching the box that held the remains of a man they never knew, the grandchildren of Jose Maria Balaguer Gomez, who was 56 years old when he was shot on 27 March 1940, said they had come to do what their parents and grandmother were never able to. 'We've come,' said his granddaughter Maria, 'to take him home. He's coming home now.'", "cce83449d94f0926613de90d3b36041591860c2529a100a3e40a6775": "", "a448a75e88e4115186cfd424fa64b1024f6a30a15b0cb53ae4acadcc": "It was a stunning, grisly act. A man, a climate activist and Buddhist, had set himself on fire on the steps of the US supreme court. He sat upright and didn't immediately scream despite the agony. Police officers desperately plunged nearby orange traffic cones into the court's marbled fountain and hurled water at him. It wasn't enough to save him. The death of Wynn Bruce, a 50-year-old photographer who lived in Boulder, Colorado, was a shock to those who knew him. 'It was so upsetting,' said April Lyons, a psychotherapist who knew Bruce from a therapeutic dance class they both took. 'He was a solid person, a compassionate, kind person. We had no idea he'd do this.' Bruce's father, Douglas, said he was sure the self-immolation - on 22 April, which is Earth Day - was 'a fearless act of compassion about his concern for the environment'. There is no explicit evidence of this, although Bruce had posted a fire emoji to Facebook along with the Earth Day date of his upcoming suicide. To some, though, the terrible act was an indication of the curdling anguish that many people now harbor over the escalating climate crisis. Bruce's death felt hauntingly familiar. Four years ago nearly to the exact date, David Buckel, a civil rights lawyer, walked to New York City's Prospect Park early one morning, doused himself with gasoline and set himself alight. Unlike Bruce, Buckel, who was 60, left a two-page note emailed to media outlets minutes before his death stating that 'my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.'  Bruce's death 'did make me think of what David did and also the incredible pain this sort of act causes the people who love them', said Terry Kaelber, who was Buckel's husband. The duo were vegetarians and dutifully did their recycling. Buckel, a keen composter, had become somewhat agitated about environmental depredation. 'You can never expect this, though,' said Kaelber. 'My heart pours out to Wynn's family.' The deaths also provoked a sense of frustration that such horrific acts are not only contemplated, but then have an ephemeral impact when they do occur. Kaelber said that after the flowers of condolence were cleared from near the scorched grass of Prospect Park, some climate activists took to wearing red ribbons to remind others of Buckel's sacrifice. But that, too, soon faded. 'We have no leaders on this issue, none, no one,' Kaelber said. 'So I get the despair people have but the answer isn't to do what they did. They could've had more impact joining with people who are driving for change. Imagine if Wynn had chained himself and 100 Buddhists to the gates of the supreme court instead. 'They think doing this will galvanize people, and maybe it will a few people, but my first thought with Wynn was that no one on the supreme court will care. It will just be this passing thing in the media. It's tragic.' Few people worried about the climate crisis are driven to self-harm over it, of course, let alone set themselves aflame in an echo of Thich Quang Duc, the Vietnamese monk who self-immolated in protest against the persecution of Buddhists in 1963. Instead, climate activists have marched in huge numbers, joined divestment campaigns, glued themselves to roads and chained themselves to oil drilling equipment. 'It's just so clear to me that I have to take this stand,' said Peter Kalmus, a Nasa climate scientist as he handcuffed himself to a JPMorgan Chase building during a protest in Los Angeles last month. 'We are heading towards fucking catastrophe - we are going to lose everything.' Yet most of us who fret about climate change do so discreetly. Studies have shown that while alarm over worsening wildfires, droughts, flooding and societal unrest is on the rise, not many of us talk about climate angst with others, to avoid political arguments or simply avoid bringing down the mood. Those who do speak out are often younger activists - research has shown that half of people between 16 and 25 years old believe the Earth may be doomed, while three-quarters feel anxiety when they think or hear about climate change. Some speak openly of not wanting to bring children into a hotter, harsher world. 'Living in climate truth is like living in a nightmare. It's absolutely horrible and I can understand why the vast majority of Americans don't do it,' said Margaret Klein Salamon, a clinical psychologist turned climate activist. 'But the worst part is that everyone's acting normal - it's like we are zombies. The sense of helplessness and hopelessness is holding back conversations and political action.' Salamon leads an organization, called the Climate Awakening, that facilitates 'climate emotions conversations' both in-person and virtually that encourage people to open up about their climate fears. Salamon said that many describe living in a sort of waking, powerless nightmare where an obvious catastrophe is unfolding but society just blithely ignores it. 'Some people have described it as like they are at a funeral but everyone else is treating it like a party,' said Salamon. 'People are still going to college, planning for retirement, doing all the things as if the future will look just like the past when we know that's not true. There's a delusion of normalcy.' There are regular attempts to jolt us free from political inertia, whether that's the increasingly exasperated excoriations of the Swedish school striker turned movement leader Greta Thunberg, the soaring success of the Netflix film Don't Look Up, which satirized the blase attitude of politicians and the media toward scientific warnings, or the increasingly frantic pronouncements of Antonio Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, who has said continuing use of fossil fuels is 'madness' and the work of 'dangerous radicals'. This desire to shake people from a pall of complacency may have also motivated Bruce and Buckel, although Susan Clayton, a professor of psychology and environmental studies at the College of Wooster, cautions it's risky to assume the full motivations behind a suicide. As social creatures who feed off each other's cues, however, we are all affected by what Clayton calls 'collective ignorance'. 'If there's a fire and we look around us and see no one is doing anything, you can feel you are also expected to do nothing, not realizing that other people are looking to you for the same reason,' she said. 'There's this sense that people around us are not only doing nothing about this problem, but not even acting like it's important.' For all the efforts of various activists, and promises by governments to restrain dangerous global heating, carbon emissions leapt globally last year as we reverted back to the polluting status quo before Covid lockdowns. Wildfires are now a year-round menace to the US west. On Friday, it hit 51C in Pakistan, while India has baked in such extreme, record heat that dozens of people have died and birds are falling from the sky. The UN has warned that a broken perception of risk based on 'optimism, underestimation and invincibility' is fueling such disasters. Oil and gas companies are planning, unhindered, a massive tranche of 'carbon bomb' drilling projects that will propel us firmly towards climate catastrophe. There is much to be anxious of, but some climate scientists argue we cannot let a wave of 'doomerism' become paralyzing. There is still hope that concerted action will avoid the worst, that momentum is building for a cleaner, greener world. Activism is a good release valve for climate worries, Clayton said, not only to help confront the problem but as a forum to speak to others with similar concerns. 'Climate doomerism can be harmful, because it robs us of agency, the agency we still have in determining our future,' said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University. 'I fear that doomism and defeatism leads us down the path of inaction, or worse. 'It would be much better for folks to channel those emotions toward the common goal of speaking truth to power and holding our policymakers accountable for addressing the mounting climate crisis.' To little public fanfare, two memorials were held for Wynn Bruce last week, one in Boulder and one in Minnesota, where his father still lives. Attendees spoke of his kindness and friendship. The media had noted the manner of his death as a terrible curiosity, rather than dig into his motivations, and quickly moved on to other topics. The planet continued to heat up. 'I don't believe David or Wynn's acts will drive change but maybe I'm wrong, and God bless them if it does,' said Kaelber. 'But it really is no way to do things. There is a better way.'", "68671538eb24f43308f89f41267437655d276382739cb259f77d2fa6": "Scientists have identified more than 3,000 potentially harmful chemicals that can be found in food packaging and other food-related materials, two-thirds of which were not previously known to be in contact with food. An international group of scientists analyzed more than 1,200 scientific studies where chemicals had been measured in food packaging, processing equipment, tableware and reusable food containers. A report released on Thursday by the Food Packaging Forum, a Switzerland-based non-profit, noted little is known about many of the 3,240 chemicals examined in these studies or their effects on people. Manufacturers are either intentionally or unintentionally adding these chemicals to packaging and other equipment, said Pete Myers, a report co-author and founder and chief scientist of Environmental Health Sciences, a non-profit advocacy group. Either way, many of those chemicals are ending up in the human body, he said. 'If we don't know what it is, we don't know its toxicity,' Myers said. 'The mix of chemicals is just too complicated to allow us to regulate them safely.' The new analysis, published in the journal Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, comes amid growing concerns about exposure to potentially toxic chemicals in food and water. The Food Packaging Forum has created a searchable database with the chemicals found in the packaging and equipment, known as food contact materials. While many of the chemicals on the list are known hazards such as phthalates and PFAS, others have not been adequately studied, the group said, and their health effects are unclear. Researchers were shocked to find chemicals in food contact materials that consumers could have no knowledge of. Just one-third of the chemicals studied appeared in a previously compiled database of more than 12,000 chemicals associated with the manufacturing of food contact materials. Previous studies have found potentially dangerous PFAS 'forever chemicals' in food packaging. Those chemicals have been linked to a list of health problems. Nearly two-thirds of the studies analyzed in the new report looked at chemicals in plastic. Packaging manufacturers often add chemicals without knowing the long-term ramifications, said Jessica Heiges, a UC Berkeley doctoral candidate who studies disposable food items such as plasticware and packaging and was not involved in the report. The chemicals 'are terrifying because we don't know what their impacts are', Heiges said. 'What's most alarming is this cocktail of chemicals, how they're interacting with each other. Some of them are persisting in the environment and in our bodies as we're consuming them.' It's likely many of those unknown chemicals are harmful, said Alastair Iles, an associate professor in UC Berkeley's environmental science, policy and management department, also not involved with the study. 'The report only underlines our gross ignorance when it comes to the chemicals that people are being exposed to every day,' he said. 'If we didn't know that there were so many chemicals in packages, what does that say about our knowledge about chemical risks?'", "8c4e10d9e0483b84df1f4d4b465e843d11ecf08fbfaab9b8dd84db92": "Record-breaking heatwaves in north-west India and Pakistan have been made 100 times more likely by the climate crisis, according to scientists. The analysis means scorching weather once expected every three centuries is now likely to happen every three years. The region is currently suffering intense heat, with the Indian capital New Delhi setting a new record on Sunday above 49C and the peak temperature in Pakistan reaching 51C. Millions of people are suffering from crop losses, and water and power outages. Climate scientists can link global heating to extreme weather events, showing that the impacts are damaging lives around the world right now, even with a 1.1C rise above pre-industrial global average temperatures. Another study released on Wednesday showed the extreme rainfall that hit Japan during Typhoon Hagibis in 2019 was made 67% more likely by global heating, and that human-caused climate change increased the storm's damage by $4bn (PS3.2bn). Other recent analyses showed devastating floods in South Africa and Europe, heatwaves in North America and the storms in south-east Africa were supercharged by the climate crisis. The new analysis by the UK's Met Office assessed the record-breaking temperatures in north-west India and Pakistan in April and May 2010. The current heat in the region is on track to surpass this and set a new record. The scientists used 14 computer models to assess two scenarios, one was the heated world of today and the other was a world with no human-caused climate change. They found the 2010 heatwave was 100 times more likely in our hotter world. The analysis also found that such extreme heatwaves will happen almost every year by the end of the century, even if carbon emissions decline. 'Spells of heat have always been a feature of the region's pre-monsoon climate during April and May,' said Dr Nikos Christidis, at the Met Office. 'However, our study shows that climate change is driving the heat intensity of these spells.' Paul Hutcheon at the Met Office said: 'Maximum temperatures are again likely to reach 50C in some spots later in the week or into the weekend, with continued very high overnight temperatures.' A team of scientists used the same comparison method to show how global heating had exacerbated Typhoon Hagibis. 'The negative consequences of the continued burning of fossil fuels are now evident and can be felt also in wealthy countries like Japan,' said Dr Friederike Otto, at Imperial College London and the lead of the World Weather Attribution group. 'Unless the world drastically reduces its use of oil, gas and coal, the impacts of human-caused climate change will continue to worsen.' The UN reported on Wednesday that critical global indicators of the climate crisis had broken new records in 2021, from rising oceans to the levels of heat-trapping emissions in the atmosphere. '[This] is a dismal litany of humanity's failure to tackle climate disruption. Fossil fuels are a dead end - environmentally and economically,' said Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary general. Last week, the Guardian revealed that 195 oil and gas 'carbon bombs' are planned by the fossil fuel industry, which would drive global heating beyond the 1.5C limit agreed by the world's nations.", "837aa64bc8de7abfbf4e5984e46846ad1575693db07c870b5873776d": "Critical global indicators of the climate crisis broke records in 2021, according to a UN report, from rising oceans to the levels of heat-trapping emissions in the atmosphere. The UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said these were clear signs of humanity's impact on the planet, which was bringing long-lasting effects. Extreme weather, which the WMO called the day-to-day face of the climate emergency, wreaked a heavy toll on human lives and led to hundreds of billions of dollars in damages, the agency said. Droughts and floods triggered food price rises that have been exacerbated in 2022. The WMO's State of the Global Climate in 2021 report also found the past seven years have been the hottest recorded. 'Today's State of the Climate report is a dismal litany of humanity's failure to tackle climate disruption. Fossil fuels are a dead end - environmentally and economically,' said Antonio Guterres, the secretary general of the UN.  'The only sustainable future is a renewable one. The good news is that the lifeline is right in front of us. Wind and solar are readily available and, in most cases, cheaper than coal and other fossil fuels. If we act together, the renewable energy transformation can be the peace project of the 21st century.' Prof Petteri Taalas, the WMO secretary general, said: 'Our climate is changing before our eyes. Human-induced greenhouse gases will warm the planet for many generations to come. Some glaciers have reached the point of no return and this will have long-term repercussions in a world in which more than 2 billion people already experience water stress. 'Extreme weather has the most immediate impact on our daily lives,' he said. 'We are seeing a drought emergency unfolding in the Horn of Africa, recent deadly flooding in South Africa and the extreme heat in India and Pakistan. Early warning systems are critically required [to save lives] yet these are only available in less than half of WMO's 187 member nations.' The world's oceans absorb more than 90% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases and 2021 set a record. The increasing warmth in the ocean, which is irreversible over timescales of centuries to millennia, has been especially strong in the last 20 years. Much of the ocean experienced at least one strong marine heatwave in 2021, the WMO said. The global sea level also reached a new record high in 2021. It has increased by 10cm since 1993 and the rise is accelerating, driven by the melting of ice sheets and glaciers and the thermal expansion of the ocean. The rise imperils hundreds of millions of coastal dwellers, the WMO said, and increases the damage caused by hurricanes and cyclones. Almost a quarter of CO2 emissions are absorbed by the oceans, but this causes them to become more acidic. This threatens shell-forming wildlife and corals and therefore food security, tourism and coastal protection, the WMO said. The oceans are now more acidic than for at least 26,000 years. CO2 and methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, are at record levels, with CO2 concentration 50% higher than before the Industrial Revolution sparked the mass burning of fossil fuels. The global temperature in 2021 was 1.1C above the pre-industrial average, moving closer towards the 1.5C limit agreed by the world's nations to avoid the worst climate impacts. The WMO noted exceptional heatwaves in 2021 in western North America and the Mediterranean, deadly flooding in Henan, China, and western Europe, and rain being recorded for the first time on the summit of Greenland's ice sheet. The agency warned eastern Africa is facing a high risk of rains failing for a fourth consecutive season, meaning the worst drought in 40 years. Prof James Hansen, who warned the world about the climate crisis in testimony to the US Senate in 1988, said this week there was 'a spectacular, continuing failure of governments to adopt effective long-term energy and climate policies. 'We must all be aware that demands for effective policies will yield only superficial change as long as the role of special interests in government remains unaddressed.' Last week, the Guardian revealed that 195 oil and gas 'carbon bombs' were planned by the industry, ie projects each producing at least a billion tonnes of CO2. These carbon bombs alone would drive global heating beyond the 1.5C limit, but the dozen biggest oil companies are on track to spend $103m a day to 2030 on climate-busting schemes.", "3d2c0334906d4a70845746d1908a1695a55b52e6c3004ed1a2633cc6": "The widow of a British-based photographer who was murdered by Col Gaddafi's forces in Libya in 2011 has accused South Africa of withholding crucial information about her husband's death that could help in efforts to locate his body. Anton Hammerl was killed in an incident in May 2011 that saw other journalists, including James Foley - who was later kidnapped and beheaded by Islamic State in Syria - taken prisoner. Penny Sukhraj-Hammerl found out on 19 May 2011 her husband was dead after 44 days of being led to believe that he was still alive in captivity along with other journalists. The body of Hammerl - who was shot and left for dead in the desert - has never been found despite a years-long campaign by his widow.  At issue is the circumstances of the return of Hammerl's passport to his widow by South Africa in 2016. Sukhraj-Hammerl believes the circumstances of how his passport came to be in South Africa may help the family find his body. 'It was posted to my office in mid-2016. I was quite overwhelmed as I didn't expect it,' she said, explaining that her husband would have been carrying his ID document at the time of his death in a photographer's waist pouch he wore. Despite the unexplained delivery of the passport, the family's subsequent efforts to find out how the passport came to be handed over to the South African government, including a freedom of information request, have been stonewalled repeatedly, prompting the family to go public about the passport. In a letter sent this week to the South African high commissioner, Nomatemba Tambo, in London and copied to the country's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, the family's anger is palpable. 'It's been nearly a year since I first wrote to you and your government to request a meeting regarding the case of my late husband ... who was murdered by Gaddafi forces in Libya in April 2011. 'During this time, we have signalled publicly and privately on several occasions that we would like to meet urgently to discuss a matter of serious concern in the handling of our case. More than a decade since Anton's death, we still don't know the location of his remains. 'We still don't have a grave to visit. We still don't know the truth. Your administration's response? Silence.' Sukhraj-Hammerl told the Guardian: 'I'm baffled by their response. They've demonstrated no regard for accountability. We've requested meetings that have not been granted. 'I feel that they had information that they should have shared with us. So many officials involved that I find it hard to believe that someone doesn't know something as significant as how a passport came to be handed over.' Sukhraj-Hammerl, 46, will also be speaking at a public event at the Frontline Club in London on Thursday evening, the 11th anniversary of the discovery of his death, where she will be joined by James Foley's mother, Diane, and Matthew Caruana Galizia, one of the sons of assassinated Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. The issue with the passport has been part of a series of rebuffs for the family since Anton disappeared in 2011. The family were led to believe that the then South African president Jacob Zuma (who has denied accusations of receiving $30m from Gaddafi) would raise the issue on a visit to Tripoli in the last days of Gaddafi's rule, only to discover it was not discussed. 'I think we're calling for justice and truth. We've not had the due - as family we should have had. It's been really distressing. It's horrid (to) realise [the South African government] had an opportunity to do more and choose deliberately (to) ignore us. 'We have a right to know. They owe us an explanation. It is least that they can do.' The South African high commission in London has been approached for comment.", "bfeb0d96dabb7bcd0166cd62556659843689293b79e8328b1e36342e": "Sigmund Freud was unavailable for comment, but George W Bush saying Iraq instead of Ukraine when condemning 'a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion' certainly suggests he still has a lot on his unconscious mind. The former president jokingly attributed the slip to his 75 years, but there has always been a faulty connection between his brain and his tongue. There are whole books full of 'Bushisms', like his boast that people 'misunderestimated' him, and how much he felt for single mothers 'working hard to put food on your family'. There may have been something Freudian about his 2004 warning that America's enemies 'never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we'. And then there was the time he was thanking an army general for his service in 2008, telling him he 'really snatched defeat out of the jaws of those who are trying to defeat us in Iraq'. Bush has already told us that the fiasco of Iraq's non-existent weapons of mass destruction still troubles him. 'No one was more shocked and angry than I was when we didn't find the weapons,' he wrote in his memoir, Decision Points. 'I had a sickening feeling every time I thought about it. I still do.' But Bush sought to justify the 2003 invasion anyway, on the grounds that Saddam Hussein was a vicious despot 'pursuing' weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and therefore the US was safer without him in the world. The 43rd president was making a similar argument to an audience at his presidential library in Dallas when he made his gaffe on Wednesday. Bush was making a distinction between a democratically elected Volodymyr Zelenskiy, 'the Churchill of the 21st century', and the rigged elections and despotism of Vladimir Putin's Russia, where the absence of checks and balances led to 'the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq - I mean Ukraine'. The audience laughed along, but the mistake was a reminder that the world is still living with the consequences of that invasion. It broke Iraq and set off a sectarian civil war in which hundreds of thousands of people died. Nearly two decades on, it continues to weaken the US on the world stage, and is undoubtedly a factor in the ambivalence of countries in Africa and the Middle East over joining a decisive global response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Putin has cynically copied from the Iraq playbook the Bush administration left behind, with spurious claims of Ukrainian WMD. The US failure to prosecute war crimes by US troops and contractors, its use of torture in the 'global war on terror' and Bush's campaign to undermine the international criminal court, all contributed to a more permissive environment for the many crimes against humanity that have followed Iraq, from Syria to Ukraine and well beyond. Wednesday's Bushism was a reminder that for all the former president's aw shucks self-deprecatory jokes about Iraq, it was never really funny.", "71b4a4dff5b02b64b7d2e8570193becba5677e0865debd10296a3999": "McDonald's has reached a deal to sell all its restaurants in Russia to one of its licensees in the country, the businessman Alexander Govor, who will operate them under a new name. The fast food company temporarily closed hundreds of outlets across Russia in March after Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, a decision that has cost McDonald's about $55m (PS44m) a month. On Monday, it announced it would sell those stores and leave Russia, saying the humanitarian crisis caused by the war and the unpredictable operating environment meant continuing running restaurants there was 'no longer tenable' or 'consistent with McDonald's values'. Govor, who operates 25 restaurants in Siberia, has agreed to buy its 850 Russian restaurants and run them under different branding, McDonald's said on Thursday. McDonald's did not disclose how much the outlets were sold for. Last year, its Russian operations contributed 9% of the company's total annual sales, or about $2bn. Govor, a licensee since 2015, has agreed to retain McDonald's 62,000 Russian employees for at least two years on equivalent terms and to fund existing liabilities to suppliers, landlords and utilities. He also agreed to pay the salaries of McDonald's corporate employees until the sale is completed. The sale is subject to regulatory approval but is expected to close within a few weeks, McDonald's said. Govor is also half-owner of Neftekhimservis, a construction investor that owns an oil refinery in Siberia, and is a board member of another firm that owns projects in Siberia including Novokuznetsk's Park Inn hotel and private clinics. McDonald's was among the first western consumer brands to enter Russia in 1990. Its large, gleaming store near Pushkin Square in Moscow, which opened shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, signalled a new era of optimism in the wake of the cold war. It's the first time the company has 'de-arched,' or exited a major market. It plans to start removing golden arches and other symbols and signs with the company's name. McDonald's said it will will maintain its trademarks in Russia and take steps to enforce them if necessary. It's unclear if other US chains will follow McDonald's lead and leave Russia. McDonald's owned 84% of its Russian stores, which gave it more control over operations than many of its rivals whose stores are owned by franchisees. Starbucks' 130 Russian stores have been closed since early March. Its franchisee in the country, Kuwait-based Alshaya Group, is continuing to pay its 2,000 Russian employees. Papa John's suspended corporate operations in Russia and is no longer accepting royalty payments from its 185 stores there. But the stores, which are owned by Colorado-based entrepreneur Christopher Wynne, remain open. A message was left Thursday with one of Wynne's companies. McDonald's left open the possibility that it could one day return to Russia. 'It's impossible to predict what the future may hold, but I choose to end my message with the same spirit that brought McDonald's to Russia in the first place: hope,' the chief executive, Chris Kempczinski, wrote in a letter to employees. 'Thus, let us not end by saying, 'goodbye.' Instead, let us say as they do in Russian: until we meet again.'", "c999ae1846bfc456a0fa8f0a1fc7bcb9f589fb41ea3a7924d04d7a8f": "The prime minister had been telling colleagues for weeks that he believed he would receive no further fines for breaching Covid rules, but many saw it as little more than typical Johnsonian bluster. When it emerged on Thursday that he was correct - despite attending several of the dozen booze-fuelled gatherings held on his watch - one exasperated backbencher said simply: 'No words.' With Johnson reassured by the Metropolitan police that they would take no further action, his team are now close to getting the closure they have long hoped for. It appears for the moment that 'Operation Save Big Dog', as he reportedly called the effort to protect him, has succeeded. Several senior figures were sacrificed over the scandal, including Johnson's director of communications, Jack Doyle, and chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield - as well as his press secretary, Allegra Stratton, who resigned after being caught on film joking about a 'cheese and wine' gathering she didn't even attend. The prime minister will give his own account in a public statement next week, no doubt adopting a similar apologetic tone to that seen in previous Partygate revelations, though it rarely appears to last much beyond his moment at the dispatch box. Conveniently for No 10, the waters have been nicely muddied by the fact that the clean-living Rishi Sunak also received a fixed-penalty notice (FPN) for the one event Johnson was fined for - and that the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is now being investigated by Durham constabulary over an alleged lockdown breach. Of course, Johnson must still survive the scrutiny of Sue Gray, the senior civil servant whose full report into the party culture in locked-down Downing Street is now expected next week. Gray's truncated report, published in January, already highlighted what she called 'failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times', though she declined to specify individual names. Johnson deliberately chose to interpret it at the time not as an indictment of his behaviour, but rather a plea for a shake-up in the management structures within No 10. Ministers such as Oliver Dowden reinforced that reading, claiming the prime minister was tackling the rotten culture that had developed in Downing Street. But former insiders insist Johnson was absolutely central to the boozy culture that developed among his team, praising them for letting off steam and sometimes pouring drinks himself. But senior civil servants were also culpable, and the balance of fines - with just one falling to the prime minister, 125 to others - will strengthen Johnson's argument that he wasn't the driving force behind many of the events, despite being the most senior person in the building. Gray's final report is expected to set out the details of what took place at each of the gatherings she investigated. Much of that information is already in the public domain but seeing it in black and white may still be shocking. The question for backbench MPs will be to what extent they choose to hold the prime minister responsible for what took place. Many have remained carefully on the fence, citing the importance of allowing the Met and Gray investigations to take their course. They will now have to decide whether they can defend him in public. Johnson also faces a privileges committee investigation in the weeks ahead that will examine whether he misled parliament by claiming all guidance was followed in No 10 - a misdemeanour that according to the ministerial code should result in resignation. There are more moments of danger ahead, too, including two crucial byelections on 23 June, in Wakefield and Tiverton - which Labour and the Liberal Democrats respectively are optimistic about winning - and the bleak outlook for living standards, with Sunak and Johnson under intense pressure to do more to help. Even if MPs conclude that receiving just a single FPN helps to airbrush out Johnson's role in Partygate, the public may decide otherwise. 'The fact remains that he's still been fined, and this doesn't erode that or take that away, so in terms of the seriousness of the situation I don't think it changes anything,' said the pollster James Johnson, of JL Partners. 'It stops a bad situation getting worse; but the public made up their mind a long time ago.'", "52a2e98c3ad37e8804667b280fffb0ec3e3837b0e52fb1e7d507fb81": "Israel will not launch a criminal investigation into the killing of the US-Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh, which Palestinian officials and witnesses have blamed on Israeli soldiers. In a statement released on Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces claimed that because Abu Aqleh was killed in an 'active combat situation', an immediate criminal investigation would not be launched, although an 'operational inquiry' would continue. According to a report in the Haaretz newspaper, the Israeli military police branch has accepted the assurances of Israeli troops that they were not aware she was in a village adjacent to the Jenin refugee camp when she was killed on 11 May. The Biden administration and the UN security council have called for a transparent investigation.  Abu Aqleh was a household name across the Arab world, known for documenting the hardship of Palestinian life under Israeli rule for Al Jazeera. Her killing received widespread international coverage and prompted criticism from the White House. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, promised her family that Washington would demand that her death be properly investigated. Abu Aqleh was killed during an arrest raid by an Israeli commando unit on Palestinian militants. According to Haaretz, the head of the Commando Brigade, Col Meni Liberty, identified six occasions during the raid when Israeli soldiers opened fire, allegedly at armed Palestinians who were near Abu Aqleh and other journalists. The Israeli military had previously released an account that said it could not unequivocally determine the source of the bullet that killed Abu Aqleh. That account speculated that the bullet could have been fired by either a Palestinian militant or an Israeli soldier using a 'telescopic scope' at 200 metres. Palestinian officials have refused to give the recovered bullet to Israeli authorities to analyse but said it welcomed international investigations. The decision by the Israeli military advocate general, Maj Gen Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, not to order an investigation by the military police criminal investigation division marks a departure from the majority of recent incidents involving IDF shootings of civilians in the occupied West Bank, which have been followed by investigations. At her funeral on Friday police beat mourners carrying her casket, prompting more criticism of Israeli authorities. Last week the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, complained about a lack of Israeli accountability for deaths in the occupied territories. Commenting on Abu Aqleh's killing and the subsequent violence at her funeral, Bachelet said: 'As I have called for many times before, there must be appropriate investigations into the actions of Israeli security forces. 'Anyone found responsible should be held to account with penal and disciplinary sanctions commensurate to the gravity of the violation. This culture of impunity must end now.' The Israeli NGO Yesh Din criticised the decision not to investigate, saying that 'the army law enforcement mechanisms no longer even bother to give the appearance of investigating'. More than 100 artists, including Hollywood stars, acclaimed authors and prominent musicians, have meanwhile signed a joint letter condemning Abu Aqleh's killing. Steve Coogan, Kathryn Hahn, Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon and Tilda Swinton were among the signatories to a letter published by Artists for Palestine UK that called for 'full accountability for the perpetrators of this crime and everyone involved in authorising it'. The Israel Defence Forces released a statement on Thursday claiming that 'dozens of Palestinian gunmen fired recklessly and indiscriminately while IDF soldiers were conducting counter-terrorism activities in the Jenin camp' on the day that Abu Aqleh died. 'An exchange of fire occurred between Palestinian gunmen and the soldiers. Toward the end of the activity, the journalist Shireen Abu [Aqleh], who was present at the battle zone during the exchange of fire, was hit. 'Due to the nature of the active combat situation, an immediate [military criminal] investigation was not launched. A decision regarding the necessity of an ... investigation will be determined by the military advocacy, in accordance with the findings of the still-ongoing operational inquiry, as is standard in such cases.' The police branch decision came a day after Israeli authorities said they have given the go-ahead for flag-waving Jewish nationalists to march through the heart of the main Palestinian thoroughfare in Jerusalem's Old City later this month, in a decision that threatens to re-ignite violence in the holy city. The office of the public security minister, Omer Barlev, said the march would take place on 29 May along its 'customary route' through Damascus Gate, which is an Arab neighbourhood.The Old City, located in East Jerusalem, has experienced weeks of violent confrontations between Israeli police and Palestinian demonstrators, and the march threatens to trigger new unrest.", "ad10fb763a6d51125d0142d0aa3e5b7fd07a4be31a8ea8d1182f6107": "Sri Lanka has defaulted on its debts for the first time in its history as it struggles with an economic and political crisis triggered by global shock waves from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. An inflation rate spiralling towards 40%, shortages of food, fuel and medicines and rolling power blackouts have led to nationwide protests and a plunging currency, with the government short of the foreign currency reserves it needed to pay for imports. The Sri Lankan central bank governor said on Thursday that the oldest democracy in Asia had fallen into a 'pre-emptive default' on its debts after the expiry of a 30-day grace period for missed interest payments on two of its sovereign bonds. It is the first default by an Asia-Pacific nation this century, according to the credit rating agency Moody's. Sri Lanka said last month that it would stop repaying its international debts to conserve dwindling foreign currency reserves, vital for importing key raw materials from overseas. Speaking on Thursday after the deadline passed for making $78m (PS62.8m) of payments to international creditors, Nandalal Weerasinghe, the central bank governor, said: 'Our position is very clear: until there is a debt restructure, we cannot repay.' Sri Lanka has suspended repayments on about $7bn of international loans due this year, out of a total foreign debt pile worth $51bn. The country's finance ministry has said it has $25m in usable foreign reserves. Economists fear Sri Lanka could be the first in a wave of defaults, as other low- and middle-income countries struggle with runaway inflation and supply shocks. The IMF has opened rescue talks with Egypt and Tunisia, both big importers of wheat from Russia and Ukraine, and with Pakistan, which has imposed power cuts because of the high cost of imported energy. Turkey is battling 70% inflation but has so far avoided the need for a bailout. Weerasinghe told a news conference on Thursday that adequate dollars had been released to pay for fuel and cooking gas shipments, helped by $130m from the World Bank and remittances in foreign currency sent home by Sri Lankans working overseas. The central bank alongside the government has begun discussions with the International Monetary Fund aimed at working towards a programme to address its economic challenges. 'Expeditious arrangements are being made to commence the external debt restructuring process,' it said. Negotiations have also been started to obtain bridging finance to secure foreign currency required to finance imports of essential goods and to strengthen the nation's social safety net programmes, it added. Sri Lanka's new prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, said this week that the crisis would get worse in the next couple of months before it could get better. The worst economic crisis since Sri Lanka's independence in 1948 has led to the resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister after months of protests that involved violent, fatal clashes on the streets of the capital. The Covid pandemic had triggered a collapse in tourism, leading to a fall in foreign currency income and rising debt levels - a situation made worse by the surge in global commodity prices this spring, exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who appointed Wickremesinghe to replace his brother as prime minister, has continued to refuse to bow to demands of the electorate and has held on to power. Inflation in Sri Lanka is expected to rise close to 40% within months, having reached almost 30% in April, with food prices up by about half in the past year. The Sri Lankan rupee has fallen by 45% against the dollar since the central bank stopped defending the currency in early March, at a time when the US currency has risen sharply in value on foreign exchange markets as the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates in response to rising inflationary pressures.", "4ac6d7d9ae682e907b7d1d61021424b627d985bf0f2ecf881cc7c7f4": "The EU ambassador to the UK has rejected Liz Truss's demand that the Northern Ireland protocol be rewritten, and issued a blunt warning of retaliation if the government passes a law disapplying aspects of the agreement. 'Unilateral calls for unilateral; action calls for action,' Joao Vale de Almeida told journalists at Westminster. He lamented the continuing distrust between the two sides, and argued little had changed in the past 18 months since the government was threatening to pass the internal markets bill. 'I'm worried about the low levels of trust that exist today, between the EU and the UK: between our leaders, between all of us that are involved in this relationship,' he said. 'Some people call it a saga. If this is a saga, if I look at the new season of the saga, it looks pretty much like a similar plot. Not much has changed.' 'We have the same narrative,' he added. 'Using legislation to override an international treaty. I feel myself back in the fall of 2020, with the internal markets bill.' Vale de Almeida insisted there was no prospect of a change in the negotiating mandate given by the EU to its Brexit representative, Maros Sefcovic - a demand made repeatedly by the foreign secretary. 'We were told that we should get a new mandate. Well, I can tell you very clearly, what the member states are telling us is very simple: you don't need a mandate, and even if you ask for one, you will not get it,' he said. 'We can't renegotiate the protocol: the ink on the signatures is hardly dry'. Truss set out her intentions in a dramatic statement earlier this week, in which she said she preferred a negotiated solution but set out plans for a bill that would rework aspects of the protocol. The stakes in the dispute have been raised since the DUP refused to take part in a power-sharing executive at Stormont unless the protocol is radically altered. Changes mooted by the government include creating a 'green channel' to allow goods to pass without checks from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, as long as they are not destined for the Republic of Ireland. It would give the UK more powers to change VAT in Northern Ireland. But Vale de Almeida rejected the proposal. 'The problem with this approach, we believe, is that it does not necessarily solve any problems, and it most likely creates more problems.' He suggested instead that the UK government return to proposals for applying the protocol already made by the EU. Truss rejected these as making the situation worse - but Brussels said ministers have not yet fully engaged with them. 'We believe that what we put on the table, the potential of those proposals is not yet exhausted,' the ambassador said. 'There is untapped potential in those proposals for us to find solutions - provided we are focused on finding solutions.' He argued that rocky relations over the protocol were having a knock-on effect on other aspects of the UK-EU relationship - including the UK's participation in the Horizon programme of scientific cooperation. Acknowledging the importance of UK scientists to the scheme, Almeida conceded that it was 'collateral damage' in the standoff over the protocol.", "1b83dd876940f3d4bb318d65209e96b3be9b811162fa2938b3b83d52": "A medical school in Tokyo that made it harder for female students to pass entrance exams has been ordered to pay compensation to 13 women for gender discrimination. Juntendo University said in 2018 that it had raised the bar for women in the exams to 'narrow the gap with male students', as a scandal over medical school admissions uncovered improper practices at several institutions. The university argued at the time that women had better communication skills, and were therefore at an advantage in the interview part of their applications. A Tokyo district court spokesperson said Juntendo had been ordered to pay the plaintiffs, with local media reporting the total compensation came to about Y=8m (PS50,000). The university declined to comment. A government investigation was launched four years ago after another school, Tokyo Medical University, admitted it had systematically lowered the scores of female applicants to keep women in the student body at around 30%. The government report said female applicants were discriminated against at four of the 81 schools it studied. Local media reported at the time that admissions staff believed women would leave the medical profession or work fewer hours when they married and had children. Tokyo Medical School, Juntendo University and Kitasato University admitted the issue and apologised, while St Marianna University of Medicine denied the claims. Several lawsuits have been filed against the universities since the report's publication in 2018.", "4c0fb6a5e3206919ee250434a5e32bafaceab5b4af8fcc343b439c3b": "Mozambique has identified its first case of wild polio in three decades following the genetic sequencing of a similar strain of the childhood disease in Malawi earlier this year. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization's regional director for Africa, said the detection of the new case was 'greatly concerning' and that it demonstrated 'how dangerous this virus is and how quickly it can spread'. Africa was declared free of indigenous wild polio in 2020, and the latest case would not affect that certification as it appeared to be an imported strain, the WHO said. Polio eradication has been one of the great global health success stories and wild poliovirus is now endemic only in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The case in Mozambique, identified in the north-eastern Tete province, is the first since 1992, with the infected child having begun to experience the onset of paralysis in late March. Genomic sequencing analysis indicated that the newly confirmed case was linked to a strain that circulatied in Pakistan in 2019, similar to the case reported in Malawi earlier this year. Ahmed Ogwell Ouma, the deputy director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said: 'When sequenced, that particular case [in Mozambique] had very close similarities to the case that had been reported in Malawi some weeks back.'  In February, Malawi declared its first case of wild poliovirus in 30 years, when a three-year old girl in the Lilongwe district was paralysed as a result of her infection. An investigation is under way in Mozambique to determine the extent of the risk posed by the new case, and the targeted responses needed. Preliminary analysis of samples collected from three contacts of the newly detected case were all negative for wild poliovirus type 1, the WHO said. Mozambique recently carried out two mass vaccination campaigns - in response to the Malawi case - in which 4.2 million children were vaccinated against the disease. Polio is a highly infectious disease, spread mainly through oral contamination by faecal matter. The virus can cause paralysis, which is sometimes fatal. There is no cure, but vaccination has brought the world close to ending the wild form of the disease.", "04b59df76fa6d4de98444491f41723fe1487135c63384eaf74df4659": "", "49b48161ff2d911000690ff7d0ec670976dce1c88d353fc4a2e8fc48": "", "7c08d4bdd923fa946e5818331e42686d896fac15b45f926b62462458": "", "8a44ba8267071cc18867894781ecaef6bb4af601fbacc0c248b31a61": "", "3b56bbbc721d89400301bb678de2d331fed98552da2d3ad69eec9e7e": "", "f78746ce18b9061a38eb3dfd32aebab9860a579d38395a37d21bb768": "", "2a54e30185c469bec64351744c37e0fb9ddde38fcb938a003caff3ce": "", "64c0b3403858981f9353d0a9c60f31715921223bb4bb058c1bdf5a88": "", "105d08ac2ca4539a8aac79ea547ffdbb4d936ef4eeed7f991d79b2e2": "", "4b7d4c76f22473f5271d0a36c402ccf6bc0959a4d0d9143e1a1a43ac": "", "682767c6017a49d184978f7a216795e54eed61c028750a11cc7d8dc7": "", "00f56bff6bc007499fb0451e469da9cc30f9a9c4afb9a2bf8e86cfcf": "", "7cbbe182b8b9d7d37d8790c6d6598883883a69ba6c99c69427dc66dd": "A 33-year-old woman in El Salvador who suffered a medical emergency while pregnant has been freed after serving a decade in jail for attempted murder, the victim of a draconian abortion ban being replicated in the US. The woman, named only as Jacqueline, sought medical help for an obstetric complication in 2011, and even though the baby survived, she was arrested on suspicion of attempted abortion. She was separated from her newborn daughter and eight-year-old son, and sentenced to 15 years for attempted murder. Jacqueline, who was released on Wednesday, is the 65th woman to be freed having been wrongly jailed on murder charges following a miscarriage or other obstetric emergency since the total ban on abortion came into force in 1998. The Salvadorian anti-abortion law, which was subsequently written into the constitution, has led to at least 182 women who suffered an obstetric emergency being prosecuted for abortion or aggravated homicide. Poor, young, women from rural areas with limited access to healthcare have been disproportionately persecuted, with most reported to the police by hospital workers. In many cases, prosecutors and judges have argued that the woman's failure to save the pregnancy amounted to murder. Salvadorian lawyers and activists have worked to free the convicted women, pursuing pardons, sentence reduction and access to education and work programs that can lead to an early release. Ten women have been freed since last December, leaving three still in prison. Each case has taken a sustained campaign of protests, public health efforts and media pressure, according to Morena Herrera, a reproductive rights campaigner who recalls the moment when lawmakers, spurred on by the religious right, voted to ban abortion without exception in April 1997. 'I warned them that this law would end the presumption of innocence for pregnant women, which is exactly what happened. It's this same risk that the US is now facing,' said Herrera. A leaked supreme court decision suggests that Roe vs Wade - the 1973 ruling which guarantees the right to abortion - will soon be overturned, resulting in about half of US states banning or severely restricting access to safe legal abortion. Texas and Oklahoma have already approved severe restrictions. Herrera added: 'Don't let our reality become your reality. If the law changes, doctors' hands will be tied and women will die. Do everything you can to stop this because the consequences of losing access to abortion are grave.' In El Salvador, a country of 6.5 million people, the consequences include death for women with ectopic pregnancies who have been denied timely medical care. Many others have suffered complications to their physical and mental health. Suicide rates among young pregnant women have risen. Last week advocates were dismayed when Esme, a 28-year-old from a poor rural community, was sentenced to 30 years for aggravated homicide after suffering a miscarriage - the first woman convicted for an obstetric complication in seven years. 'We are in shock, maybe we didn't put enough pressure. You can never take your foot off the pedal,' said Paula Avila-Guillen, a human rights lawyer and executive director of the New York-based Women's Equality Centre. Esme spent two years in jail on remand, but is currently at home while lawyers appeal the verdict. The battle to free the three other women continues. Maria del Rosario was 23 years old when she started haemorrhaging at home alone. Instead of receiving medical help, she was detained by police and sentenced to 30 years for aggravated homicide (later reduced to 20 years). Maria del Rosario's pregnancy was the result of rape; her alleged aggressor was acquitted. She has spent a decade in prison. Liliana was a 21-year-old mother expecting her second baby in 2016 when she was sentenced to 30 years in jail for homicide after suffering a medical emergency. The sentence was later halved, but she has already spent seven years separated from her daughter. The case of Bertha Arana is especially egregious. Arana, 28, was convicted of attempted murder in 2012 after suffering a medical emergency, even though her daughter survived. But unlike Jacqueline, every attempt to secure a reduction in her 30-year sentence has been blocked because Arana was born just over the border in Guatemala and does not have Salvadorian identity papers. She has not seen her daughter since giving birth. 'Bertha's case is not just unjust, it's cruel,' said Herrera. The UN has condemned such cases as arbitrary detentions. As the US contemplates the reality of a post-Roe world, the Salvadorian experience demonstrates the long-term impact on women who are criminalised. Cristina Quintanilla was 18 and excited about motherhood when she suffered a late miscarriage in 2005. She woke up handcuffed to a hospital bed, and was given 30 years for aggravated murder, though was released after serving four after a sentence review. Vilified as a 'baby killer' in El Salvador, Quintanilla was unable to find work and in 2014 made it to the US where she sought asylum. She's been in legal limbo ever since, waiting for an immigration judge to rule on the case, but was denied a work visa because of her criminal record. 'The injustice continues, I can't escape it. I'm so tired of fighting to clear my name, to be given an opportunity to live my life,' said Quintanilla, 36. 'It's very unfortunate what's happening here. Americans face a very uncertain future, it will be chaos.' The US backslide comes amid a wave of legal and political reproductive rights victories across Latin America improving access to safe abortion from women in countries such as Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Argentina. Avila-Guillen, who works with lawyers and activists across Latin America, said they had learned lessons from the erosion of abortion rights in the US. 'We realised that human rights standards and legal strategy would never be enough, we also needed mass mobilizations, activism, political work and a communication strategy, and that's what the US will need to do to win hearts and minds and get our rights back.'", "ef9027e46cb3f92f556bddf6bade6f8ff50d8491d14eada78deba47f": "", "e3118a8b3fdf275e73334addcb4d2aab50273479ebf9464c00e2a065": "In the aftermath of yet another racially motivated shooting that was live-streamed on social media, tech companies are facing fresh questions about their ability to effectively moderate their platforms. PaytonGendron, the 18-year-old gunman who killed 10 people in a largely Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, on Saturday, broadcasted his violent rampage on the video-game streaming service Twitch. Twitch says it took down the video stream in mere minutes, but it was still enough time for people to create edited copies of the video and share it on other platforms including Streamable, Facebook and Twitter. So how do tech companies work to flag and take down videos of violence that have been altered and spread on other platforms in different forms - forms that may be unrecognizable from the original video in the eyes of automated systems? On its face, the problem appears complicated. But according to Hany Farid, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley, there is a tech solution to this uniquely tech problem. Tech companies just aren't financially motivated to invest resources into developing it. Farid's work includes research into robust hashing, a tool that creates a fingerprint for videos that allows platforms to find them and their copies as soon as they are uploaded. The Guardian spoke with Farid about the wider problem of barring unwanted content from online platforms, and whether tech companies are doing enough to fix the problem. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Twitch, Facebook and YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Twitch says that it took the Buffalo shooter's video down within minutes, but edited versions of the video still proliferated, not just on Twitch but on many other platforms.  How do you stop the spread of an edited video on multiple platforms? Is there  a solution? It's not as hard a problem as the technology sector will have you believe. There's two things at play here. One is the live video, how quickly could and should that have been found and how we limit distribution of that material.  The core technology to stop redistribution is called 'hashing' or 'robust hashing' or 'perceptual hashing'. The basic idea is quite simple: you have a piece of content that is not allowed on your service either because it violated terms of service, it's illegal or for whatever reason, you reach into that content, and extract a digital signature, or a hash as it's called. This hash has some important properties. The first one is that it's distinct. If I give you two different images or two different videos, they should have different signatures, a lot like human DNA. That's actually pretty easy to do. We've been able to do this for a long time. The second part is that the signature should be stable even if the content is being modified, when somebody changes say the size or the color or adds text. The last thing is you should be able to extract and compare signatures very quickly. So if we had a technology that satisfied all of those criteria, Twitch would say, we've identified a terror attack that's being live-streamed. We're going to grab that video. We're going to extract the hash and we are going to share it with the industry. And then every time a video is uploaded with the hash, the signature is compared against this database, which is being updated almost instantaneously. And then you stop the redistribution.  How do tech companies respond right now and why isn't it sufficient?  It's a problem of collaboration across the industry and it's a problem of the underlying technology. And if this was the first time it happened, I'd understand. But this is not, this is not the 10th time. It's not the 20th time. I want to emphasize: no technology's going to be perfect. It's battling an inherently adversarial system. But this is not a few things slipping through the cracks. Your main artery is bursting. Blood is gushing out a few liters a second. This is not a small problem. This is a complete catastrophic failure to contain this material. And in my opinion, as it was with New Zealand and as it was the one before then, it is inexcusable from a technological standpoint.  But the companies are not motivated to fix the problem. And we should stop pretending that these are companies that give a shit about anything other than making money. Talk me through the existing issues with the tech that they are using. Why isn't it sufficient? I don't know all the tech that's being used. But the problem is the resilience to modification. We know that our adversary - the people who want this stuff online - are making modifications to the video. They've been doing this with copyright infringement for decades now. People modify the video to try to bypass these hashing algorithms. So [the companies'] hashing is just not resilient enough. They haven't learned what the adversary is doing and adapted to that. And that is something they could do, by the way. It's what virus filters do. It's what malware filters do. [The] technology has to constantly be updated to new threat vectors. And the tech companies are simply not doing that. Why haven't companies implemented better tech? Because they're not investing in technology that is sufficiently resilient. This is that second criterion that I described. It's easy to have a crappy hashing algorithm that sort of works. But if somebody is clever enough, they'll be able to work around it. When you go on to YouTube and you click on a video and it says, sorry, this has been taken down because of copyright infringement, that's a hashing technology. It's called content ID. And YouTube has had this technology forever because in the US, we passed the DMCA, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that says you can't host copyright material. And so the company has gotten really good at taking it down. For you to still see copyright material, it has to be really radically edited. So the fact that not a small number of modifications passed through is simply because the technology's not good enough. And here's the thing: these are now trillion-dollar companies we are talking about collectively. How is it that their hashing technology is so bad? These are the same companies, by the way, that know just about everything about everybody. They're trying to have it both ways. They turn to advertisers and tell them how sophisticated their data analytics are so that they'll pay them to deliver ads. But then when it comes to us asking them, why is this stuff on your platform still? They're like, well, this is a really hard problem.  The Facebook files showed us that companies like Facebook profit from getting people to go down rabbit holes. But a violent video spreading on your platform is not good for business. Why isn't that enough of a financial motivation for these companies to do better? I would argue that it comes down to a simple financial calculation that developing technology that is this effective takes money and it takes effort. And the motivation is not going to come from a principled position. This is the one thing we should understand about Silicon Valley. They're like every other industry. They are doing a calculation. What's the cost of fixing it? What's the cost of not fixing it? And it turns out that the cost of not fixing is less. And so they don't fix it. Why is it that you think the pressure on companies to respond to and fix this issue doesn't last? We move on. They get bad press for a couple of days, they get slapped around in the press and people are angry and then we move on. If there was a hundred-billion-dollar lawsuit, I think that would get their attention. But the companies have phenomenal protection from the misuse and the harm from their platforms. They have that protection here. In other parts of the world, authorities are slowly chipping away at it. The EU announced the Digital Services Act that will put a duty of care [standard on tech companies]. That will start saying, if you do not start reining in the most horrific abuses on your platform, we are going to fine you billions and billions of dollars. [The DSA] would put pretty severe penalties for companies, up to 6% of global profits, for failure to abide by the legislation and there's a long list of things that they have to abide by, from child safety issues to illegal material. The UK is working on its own digital safety bill that would put in place a duty of care standard that says tech companies can't hide behind the fact that it's a big internet, it's really complicated and they can't do anything about it.  And look, we know this will work. Prior to the DMCA it was a free-for-all out there with copyright material. And the companies were like, look, this is not our problem. And when they passed the DMCA, everybody developed technology to find and remove copyright material. It sounds like the auto industry as well. We didn't have seat belts until we created regulation that required seat belts. That's right. I'll also remind you that in the 1970s there was a card called a Ford Pinto where they put the gas tank in the wrong place. If somebody would bump into you, your car would explode and everybody would die. And what did Ford do? They said, OK, look, we can recall all the cars, fix the gas tank. It's gonna cost this amount of dollars. Or we just leave it alone, let a bunch of people die, settle the lawsuits. It'll cost less. That's the calculation, it's cheaper. The reason that calculation worked is because tort reform had not actually gone through. There were caps on these lawsuits that said, even when you knowingly allow people to die because of an unsafe product, we can only sue you for so much. And we changed that and it worked: products are much, much safer. So why do we treat the offline world in a way that we don't treat the online world? For the first 20 years of the internet, people thought that the internet was like Las Vegas. What happens on the internet stays on the internet. It doesn't matter. But it does. There is no online and offline world. What happens on the online world very, very much has an impact on our safety as individuals, as societies and as democracies. There's some conversation about duty of care in the context of section 230 here in the US - is that what you envision as one of the solutions to this? I like the way the EU and the UK are thinking about this. We have a huge problem on Capitol Hill, which is, although everybody hates the tech sector, it's for very different reasons. When we talk about tech reform, conservative voices say we should have less moderation because moderation is bad for conservatives. The left is saying the technology sector is an existential threat to society and democracy, which is closer to the truth. So what that means is the regulation looks really different when you think the problem is something other than what it is. And that's why I don't think we're going to get a lot of movement at the federal level. The hope is that between [regulatory moves in] Australia, the EU, UK and Canada, maybe there could be some movement that would put pressure on the tech companies to adopt some broader policies that satisfy the duty here.

A group of pro-choice activists came together with the imperative to push back against the notion that abortion rights were sacrosanct, and to motivate women to remain passionately engaged in the pro-choice struggle. Their great fear was that, with people turning their attention to other battles, the enemies of Roe might gain the upper hand. Starting in 1998, the group - including Naral, Planned Parenthood and the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice - began running ads warning of a dystopian future where Roe v Wade would be overturned. With vivid images, zeitgeist design and provocative language, the ad campaign was difficult to miss. 'If I don't get under your skin and if I don't push your buttons in some way, I'm just putting some paper out there,' says Ellis Verdi, president of Devito/Verdi, the agency that created the ads. 'I need you to fight me in order to reduce your apathy.' Using the imagery associated with backstreet abortions such as wire hangers and beat-up cars, the ads attempted to embody a bygone era. One image read: 'Per order of the supreme court, any female who enters into a marriage shall be considered the property of her husband.' Another, with a design nod to Barbara Kruger, showed an image of a young woman with tattoos and piercings, warning, 'Think you can do whatever you want with your body? Think again.' Now, with the court seemingly poised to overturn Roe v Wade, the ads seem chilling and prophetic. 'My high school had the most pregnancies of any school in the country,' says Verdi. 'In my teens I was arguing for daycare for these young women so that they could go to school. I actually won the argument and had the high school put in a daycare center. The biggest opposition was from the parents.' Verdi says the campaign also made a splash. The funders were extremely enthusiastic and financed the campaign's three-year run in cities across the US. And on-the-spot interviews of subway riders pre- and post-exposure to the ads showed heightened interest and involvement in pro-choice issues. 'I think everyone was feeling that, post-Roe v Wade, there was a tremendous increase in apathy,' says Verdi. 'If you went to college campuses, the movement didn't have the same support system. In an environment like that, you can pretty much assume it would be easier to pass legislation or overturn Roe.'", "2fafee808e566693502797d266109c8150153d85945bb1837aadafb3": "What were they thinking? That's what customers, restaurants, and delivery workers want to know after a surprise promotion by food delivery platform Grubhub went badly awry - and proved there's really no such thing as a free lunch. Grubhub's plan was ambitious: to feed everyone in New York City and the surrounding Tri-State area for free, during lunch hours on Tuesday. The platform cited a survey it had conducted that found that 69% of working New Yorkers said they had skipped lunch. But that's exactly what the stunt ended up doing, after Grubhub's platform crashed as New Yorkers rushed to place orders. The fiasco left restaurants overwhelmed, delivery workers frustrated, and many customers with empty stomachs. Christopher Krautler, a spokesperson for Grubhub, said the platform was averaging up to 6,000 orders a minute, which 'absolutely blew away all expectations'. Krautler acknowledged that the demand 'initially caused a temporary delay in our system and some users experienced an error message with their code, but that was quickly rectified', adding the platform fulfilled more than 450,000 lunch orders connected to the promotion. But many users never saw their food after spending money, with some kept hungry and waiting for hours by the app's promises that the food would soon arrive. The app was offering $15 off of any order made in the New York City area between 11am and 2pm. Restaurants across the city were inundated. Fee Bakhtiar, a general manager at Jajaja Mexicana in West Village, called it a 'shitshow'. When she opened the restaurant at 11.30am, she was stunned to find 40 orders from Grubhub already waiting in the queue. 'I was like, wait, this can't be real. And then all of a sudden, it was just kind of like, 'Oh well, I guess it is real.'' Bakhtiar said Jajaja West Village, which focuses on takeout, was able to fulfill all of its Grubhub orders - which suddenly disappeared at 2pm. 'But it would've just been nice if we had a heads up.' She told the Guardian that neither she nor the managers at Jajaja's other locations in New York received an email or a mobile notification from the platform warning that the promotion would happen. But many restaurants were unable to cope. Megan Benson, a worker at a fast casual chicken restaurant in Brooklyn, said that the flood of lunch orders created shortages that spilled over into dinnertime, turning the kitchen into a 'war zone'. The restaurant is 'typically busy from the moment we open the door, and nobody told us about this this free lunch thing', she said. 'Normally it's a tight ship in there, but we couldn't keep up. We had no time to restock anything, so half the stuff was missing or sold out.' 'The phone wouldn't stop ringing because people were calling mad as hell to tell us that they were missing items, or they just never got their food picked up, so the Grubhub delivery guys would have to keep coming back. 'Eventually my co-workers just just got irate with phones constantly being shoved in their faces. Believe me when I say fights almost broke out.' Toward the end of the shift, the kitchen was down to just Benson and another co-worker, who struggled to stay afloat. 'It was just too much, and I had to keep reminding myself out loud, 'I'm just one person,' because I had to take the orders and make the orders while my co-worker did all the overflowing Grubhub orders. There was nowhere to put them, either.' The delays meant Benson had to stay well past midnight to clean up, and she finally got home at 3.30am. 'I just hope we get overtime pay this week,' she said. Krautler said that Grubhub 'gave advance notice to all restaurants in our network, which included multiple forms of communications across email and in-platform ...even with that preparation, no one could anticipate the level of demand and unfortunately that caused strain on some restaurants'. It wasn't much better for customers some of whom still ended up out of pocket from the 'free' promotion. Chloe Brailsford, a comic artist who moved to Brooklyn last year, was quarantining at home with Covid and decided to use Grubhub for the first time after learning about the promotion from a friend. By the time she logged on shortly after 1pm, she noticed that many of the restaurants on the app had marked themselves as 'closed'. At first, she tried Taco Bell, but a notification popped up as she was ordering, saying the restaurant was no longer available. Then she managed to find an Ihop that was still taking orders, with a delivery estimate of 45 to 55 minutes. It took two tries to put through her request for a Belgian waffle combo and hash browns - which, even after the discount, still cost $22.26 including delivery fees. '(The app) said it would arrive between 2.59pm and 3.09pm. And I was like, that's a lot longer than 45 minutes.' By 5pm, Brailsford still didn't have any food. She watched the estimated arrival change to 8pm: 'I was like, what the fuck is happening?' She tried calling Grubhub's customer support, but sat on hold for more than half an hour before giving up and going to the grocery store to buy her dinner: a can of Progresso soup. Krautler did not respond to a question about whether customers such as Brailsford would receive their money back. For delivery workers, the promotion was a mixed bag. According to Krautler, Grubhub increased its incentives to workers to support the demand, and drivers 'generally made two to three times more than usual during the promotion'. Two delivery workers told the Guardian they made higher than usual earnings as Grubhub spammed their phones begging them to come online: one worker, Artemiy Isakov, said the bonuses helped him make about $500 over six hours of work. Another worker, Maurice Jamison, said he pulled in $300 across breakfast, lunch, and dinner. But other workers - including some thousands of miles away from New York - reported not being able to log on at all as the app strained under demand. One Grubhub worker in California told the Guardian that his app 'froze multiple times and completely stopped working' during the time of the New York free lunch promo; he was only able to complete three deliveries during eight hours online, netting him just $28 for the day. As Grubhub's systems heaved, it outsourced some orders to third-party delivery platforms, which quickly became affected as well. A worker for Relay, a New York City-based delivery platform, told the Guardian that soon after using the promotion as a customer to get a free sandwich, he noticed orders began to pile up in his courier app. The worker, who asked not to be identified, said one order he was assigned to pick up was missing. Relay's app requires workers to contact their support line to report order issues, but nobody picked up after more than 30 minutes of waiting. After unassigning himself from the order, he received another order, which the restaurant had no record of on their system. 'Again after waiting 30 minutes for help from Relay, I got nothing. The app rates your performance, and unassigning yourself affects your rating, so I'm very hesitant to do it. I've gotten a warning already. 'I better not get punished for this,' the worker said. 'Relay was absolutely not prepared.' Relay did not respond to a request for comment. Hildalyn Colon-Hernandez, the policy director at Los Deliveristas Unidos, a labor group representing New York City delivery workers, said that as Grubhub's app sputtered out yesterday, many workers were left holding orders in their hands, unable to deliver. 'Sometimes the workers show up to the restaurant, and the restaurants have not even received the order from the app,' she said. 'That leads to a confrontation, because the workers are like, 'I'm already on the clock, I need to get there on time, but the restaurant is already packed.' And when they deliver to the customers, they're saying, 'I've been waiting for this for two hours.'' Brailsford, who is still waiting for reimbursement for her failed Ihop order, doesn't blame New Yorkers for the chaos: 'People saw a deal, and they wanted it, because who the fuck in this goddamn economy doesn't want to save some money on food?' But she has harsher words for Grubhub. 'You could've thought about this for any longer than half a second, and you might've realized what kind of terrible idea you were doing.'", "26b006b583a7822be2fe3839559dd00d4a65de4cee68dcdc15a47881": "Brad Raffensperger was on his way out when the bartender stopped him. He wanted a word. The man had been lingering in the doorway as Raffensperger, a Republican serving as Georgia's top election official, spoke to a little over a dozen members of the chamber of commerce in Washington, a small town about two hours east of Atlanta. Raffensperger had seen him from the lectern and asked if he wanted to ask a question - he declined. Now the bartender had more courage. He wanted to ask about the phone call. 'How did that make you feel?' he said. He was referring to the infamous 2 January 2021 call from Donald Trump in which the president asked Raffensperger to overturn the results of the 2020 election. 'All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state,' Trump said. Raffensperger, who oversaw three recounts of the presidential vote, all of which affirmed Joe Biden's victory, refused the request, enraging Trump. That phone call is now at the center of what may be the most important primary election this year. Raffensperger is running for re-election as Georgia's secretary of state and Trump is seeking to oust him from office. He wants to replace him with Jody Hice, a Republican congressman who has said the election was stolen and joined efforts to overturn it. It's one of several races across the country in which Trump is seeking to install allies in important election administration positions in which they could throw out the results of a future election. Georgia's race is especially significant - it's the only place where Trump is seeking to punish a statewide Republican election official for explicitly refusing his request to subvert democracy. It could determine whether the person overseeing the next presidential election in Georgia is someone who prevented an election from being overturned or someone who tried to overturn the last one. Election day is 24 May and the race is very close, recent polling shows. Whoever wins will oversee elections in Georgia, which has emerged in recent years as ground zero in fights over election rules. The state has long been seen as a Republican bastion, but in recent years non-white voters have been exercising new levels of political power. It is now a political battleground after Democrats won the presidential race and two Senate seats last year. 'All eyes should be on this race between Raffensperger and Hice,' said Joanna Lydgate, CEO of States United Action, which is tracking election deniers running for office across the country. 'Georgia was a place in 2020 where we watched three statewide elected officials stand up and protect the vote, protect the will of the voters. If we want to see that happen again in 2024, if there are further efforts to undermine our elections and the results and ultimately the will of American voters, we need to make sure that we're electing people who fundamentally believe in the system.' She noted all three officials who refused to overturn the election in 2020 - the governor, attorney general and secretary of state - are up for re-election. Raffensperger, a mild-mannered engineer, is an odd fit to be at the center of a race for US democracy. He's not a flamethrower and he's a little bit awkward as a politician, occasionally stumbling over his words. He can land a political punch, but is more comfortable discussing trusses and beams and quoting Ecclesiastes and CS Lewis. One day in early May, Raffensperger stood in front of the federal courthouse in Atlanta, a wrinkle or two in his red tie, as he raised his voice to speak over nearby construction. After speaking and taking questions for about 10 minutes, he darted off from the podium, down the steps, and hurried back toward his office at the Georgia capitol. 'I'm an engineer through and through and so sometimes I'm not as eloquent with my words as I need to be,' he said the next day. He also has wholeheartedly championed traditional Republican efforts to restrict voting access. He is a staunch defender of a new Georgia law that bans handing out food or water to people standing in line to vote. He believes Georgia should get rid of no-excuse mail-in voting. He also supports getting rid of a federal blackout period that prevents people from being purged from the voter rolls within 90 days of an election. The centerpiece of his campaign is preventing non-citizen voting, which is virtually nonexistent, according to Raffensperger's own office. Nse Ufot, CEO of the non-partisan New Georgia Project, which works on voter registration in the state, said Raffensperger had received national praise for not overturning the election, 'as if that alone is the litmus test as to whether someone is a vote suppressor or not'. 'He did not break the law that one time. That does not mean that he does not align with the party's priorities and with their lies and rhetoric about voting,' she said. Raffensperger's focus on non-citizen voting in particular shows how he is pandering to his party, said Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University. 'He is looking for a low-cost symbolic gesture that I think he hopes will restore his conservative bona fides among people who questioned them because he didn't overturn the results of the 2020 election,' she said. Raffensperger has refused to back down from his defense of the 2020 election, essentially betting that voters will re-elect him for doing his job and standing up to Trump, even if they support the former president. At the event in Washington, Raffensperger methodically laid out his case for upholding the results of the 2020 election to the small crowd (there was a competing baseball game and awards dinner that night). He relied on statistics: 28,000 Georgia voters skipped the presidential election but voted down ballot, Raffensperger said, repeating a statistic he frequently mentions on the campaign trail. Republican members of Congress got 33,000 more votes in Georgia than Trump did, he said. Republican state senators got 400,000 more votes than Trump, he added. He then detailed how he looked into Trump's claims of election fraud. When Trump said thousands of dead people voted in 2020, Raffensperger's office investigated and found just four. Then Trump said more than 2,000 felons voted in the 2020 election. Raffensperger investigated and found that there were possibly 74. Trump then said 2,423 non-registered voters cast a ballot in 2020. Raffensperger investigated and found there were zero. Then Trump started saying machines were flipping votes and Raffensperger did a hand recount of all 5m ballots cast in the state and found the results were essentially the same. It was one of three ballot counts in the state that affirmed Biden's victory there. 'Every allegation that was made, we checked it all out. As an engineer, you want to make sure you check it out, right? Because you don't want to look foolish,' he said later. Raffensperger doesn't say it outright, but it seems that a central bet of his campaign is that the truth about the 2020 campaign will prevail. He is betting on voters like Carolee Curtis, an 82-year-old retiree who lives in Rome, a city in deeply Republican north-west Georgia, who voted for him. At the early voting site where she voted, signs dotted the parking lot for Hice and Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right congresswoman who represents the district. There were none for Raffensperger. 'I felt that under all that pressure, he did a good job,' she said after casting her vote. 'I know it upset Trump, and I'm a Trump person, but fair is fair.' Kenneth Studdard, 56, who owns Dogwood Books in Rome, also said he liked Trump, and said he would probably vote for Raffensperger, though he wasn't following the race too closely yet. 'I think he did a good job. I think the other guy's running more for spite,' he said. It seems unlikely that Hice, a pastor and former radio host, would be running absent the myth of a stolen election. He has built his entire campaign around the idea. This contrast was on full display during a candidate debate in Atlanta in early May. Hice repeated a number of lies about the 2020 election and said that Raffensperger created so-called ballot harvesting in Georgia (Raffensperger supported a 2019 law that outlawed third-party collection of mail-in ballots). He claimed Raffensperger had made a deal with Stacey Abrams to weaken signature matching standards in the state (a 2020 court settlement required that multiple election officials check a signature before it was rejected and notify the voter before rejecting it). Hice also criticised Raffensperger for sending out mail-in ballot applications during the election (Raffensperger sent out mail-in ballot applications to all Georgia voters during the state's 2020 primary, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, but did not do so during the general election). After the debate, Hice told a small gaggle of reporters that nothing would convince him the 2020 election results were accurate. 'I would not have certified them without getting first, an absolute understanding of what an accurate election result was,' he said. 'This election was just overwhelmed with fraudulent activity. There's nothing that can change my opinion of that.' If elected secretary of state, it could be Hice on the other end the next time Trump, or another politician, calls with a request to find votes. Hice didn't answer how he would handle such a request, but said he didn't see anything wrong with it in 2020. 'Absolutely, there was nothing wrong with that request,' Hice said. 'He was not saying 'go out and find illegal ballots for me.' He was saying look at all the fraud that's out here. Do your job. Make sure we have legal ballots that are cast, legal ballots that are counted, and had Brad done so, I believe the outcome would have been different.' Trump's phone call was not a generalized request to investigate. When Raffensperger and a lawyer told the president they had probed his allegations, the president said refused to accept it. 'I won this election by hundreds of thousands of votes. There's no way I lost Georgia. There's no way,' Trump said. Hice's message that resonated with Mike Albright, 62, who voted for Hice in the Atlanta suburbs. 'I was very disappointed by the last election. I didn't think the results were honest. I think there was a lot of corruption that went on. And the current secretary of state didn't know how to do an adequate investigation,' he said. 'I don't think his audits were adequate. They weren't real audits. Basically, they didn't confirm that voters were really voters.' In Rome, Tom and Emily Saltino also voted for Hice. They said they were unconvinced Trump lost the 2020 election in Georgia because they had seen the large crowds of people that came to see him when he visited the state. '[There were] a lot of things he could have done, it seems, that was not done to satisfy the masses that everything was on the up and up', Tom, 84, said. 'I just think that position needs to be cleaned up, somebody new come in.' Emily added she would not vote for Raffensperger in November if he won the Republican nomination. During the debate, Raffensperger pointed out repeatedly that Hice was lying, but at times even he seemed exasperated by trying to convince people that was the case. 'The real problem that you have gets down to basic honesty,' he said. 'It gets down to, it was actual, total, disinformation, misinformation, outright lying. And there's not much I can do about that,' he said. 'Jody Hice has been running from one rumor to another for the last 18 months. And how can you have confidence when people that should be holding a responsible position as a sitting congressman should be telling the truth?' Talking with the bartender in Washington, Raffensperger defended his decision to stand up to Trump. 'I wanted to make sure I was respectful to President Trump's position of authority,' he began. 'He was disappointed. But I've been disappointed in life. I haven't won every football game or basketball game ever played. My volleyball team in high school wasn't that strong either, but we still played and had a good time. And when we lost, we tried harder.' 'It sounded like intimidation to me,' the man said. 'I personally appreciate what you did very much. I hope you hear that all the time.' 'You're a good man,' Raffensperger said back. 'God bless you.' Afterwards, Raffensperger lingered in the town square for a bit talking to voters as the sun set over the courthouse - the county's early voting site. He sounded like a man who was at peace with his decision to defy the leader of his party, even if it costs him his job. 'Those are all good people in there. And even people that can dog cuss you and the people that are mad, I keep in mind that they've been lied to. I gently say misinformation, disinformation. People know that there weren't thousands of dead people,' he said, swatting the occasional bug away. 'A person of integrity expects to be believed, and when he's not, he lets time prove him right. So time has proven me right.' Raffensperger would not say whether he would vote for Trump again in 2024. And he declined to say whether he would vote for Hice if he gets the Republican nomination. 'As secretary of state, I don't endorse candidates,' he said. Even though he has received an onslaught of death threats and harassment since the 2020 election, Raffensperger doesn't really seem to have given much thought to the possibility of not running again. 'If the good walk off the field and leave the field to the bad, then the bad wins,' he said. But in his race, it's quite possible that lies could prevail. What message would it send if that happens? 'It means that we need to do more rebuilding of ourselves individually,' Raffensperger said.", "1265f5a8446996ac0b361f8eb6480dbcadd074fbc39d30173921dbc0": "It is twilight in Las Horquetas valley in Patagonia's northern Aysen region. Several cars have pulled over beneath sandy cliffs on a wide paved road. Just metres away, three deer graze unperturbed in the glow of the car lights. The Patagonian huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus), or South Andean deer, is the most endangered hoofed animal in South America. It has deep inset eyes, furry antlers and is no bigger than a toddler. Fewer than 1,500 survive today - two-thirds are found in Chile and the remainder in Argentina, where the huemul's principal habitat is lenga forest and scrubland. They exist in severely fragmented groups of 101 known sub-populations, with 60% of these comprising only 10-20 individuals, making them susceptible to freak weather events. They also suffer from poor genetic diversity. The huemul was first brought to the attention of the wider public in Chile in 1834, when the British painter Charles C Wood Taylor convinced the government that a creature from the largely unexplored Patagonian territory should accompany the condor in his design for the country's coat of arms. The huemul, 'an almost unknown animal', was chosen. It has been officially protected since 2006, when it was given Chilean natural monument status, and in 2010 Chile and Argentina agreed to jointly conserve the deer. Today, conservation efforts in Chile are being stepped up. Gustavo Saldivia, founder of the Aumen Foundation, which has been protecting huemul on an 8,500-hectare (32 sq mile) area of public land near Tortel in Chile since 2001, thinks he knows why. 'It flutters its eyelashes. It's sexy,' he says.  The organisation Rewilding Chile is also working to protect huemul by buying areas of wilderness and private grazing land in Patagonia for restoration and conservation projects. In 2018, it gave 400,000 hectares of rewilded land to the country, collaborating with the government to create a Route of Parks, which today connects a patchwork of 17 national parks, extending 1,700 miles over the southern third of Chile. The Route of Parks has increased connections between disparate huemul sub-populations but ranching, hunting and construction on private land between these parks still pose a threat to the huemul. To address this, Rewilding Chile has created a huemul national corridor. 'The Route of Parks is the spine,' says Rewilding Chile's wildlife director, Cristian Saucedo, 'and now the huemul corridor forms the ribcage.' Restoring the interconnectivity of huemul populations along the length of Patagonia is the ultimate goal, says Saucedo, but first their numbers must be bolstered and threats reduced in the areas they currently occupy. Since 2020, Saucedo has overseen the purchase of 670 hectares of private land and subsequent livestock fence removal in Las Horquetas valley, connecting it to the 180,000-hectare Cerro Castillo national park to create a key part of the huemul corridor.  'These small contributions of land are very important because, even though they are small, they are key places to protect and connect these [huemul] 'islands',' says Rody Alvarez, a Rewilding Chile warden. Kristine Tompkins, co-founder of Tompkins Conservation, which launched Rewilding Chile in 2021, says: 'Respecting wildlife means undoing the damage we've done. One way of doing that is by restoring corridors for crucial species, like the huemul, whose time is running out.' In a study earlier this year, the huemul was named as one of 20 key terrestrial species whose reintroduction could positively affect biodiversity. The lead researcher, Carly Vynne, says: 'A focused effort on recovering this species would not only help the species itself but could also help complete assemblages across vast areas [of Patagonia].' Reconnecting the Patagonian pockets the huemul has been reduced to could help restore the depleted in-between landscapes, the study said. The huemul is the only large mammal missing from many Patagonian ecosystems. Saucedo describes huemul as a 'sentinel species', providing intelligence on how a damaged ecosystem is recovering. But the huemul continues to face threats, including the climate crisis and a change of land use. It has already been reduced to less than 50% of its original habitat, according to a 2018 research paper, and a further 60% reduction is expected by 2050, largely due to the impact of warmer winters. 'In the last 15 years, the region has been fragmenting very quickly,' says Alvarez. 'Landscapes are being divided into lots.' The owners of these properties often break up huemul habitat by putting up fences, often made of barbed wire. Concerted efforts to preserve the huemul mean that numbers are gradually increasing at Las Horquetas but the species is still in decline, according to the IUCN Red List. Wide-ranging conversations, says Saucedo, are needed between both public and private sectors, and with Argentina, where huemul populations straddle the border, if the huemul is to be saved. 'To rewild huemul, you require cooperation with a long-term perspective and finally the benefits are for the whole of humanity,' says Saucedo.

Seven members of the US-led team made it to the top of the mountain in one expedition, greatly increasing the number of Black people who have summited the world's highest peak from 10 to 17, out of about 10,000 in total. Manoah Ainuu, a professional climber from Spokane, Washington, was among the group and said he exceeded his high expectations in getting to the summit of Everest for the first time. 'Up there, it's a little cold,' he told the NBC Today show on Thursday morning, eliciting laughs from the hosts, as he beamed in by video with a drink in hand from Kathmandu, Nepal, where the successful team was resting. 'Down here, and on the journey to the top of the world, every place is amazing, everyone is amazing, so, yup, it's all good,' Ainuu said. The group calls itself the Full Circle Everest expedition. On their website they write: 'In 1963, the first American expedition reached the summit of Everest. That same year Dr Martin Luther King delivered his historic I Have A Dream speech. It took 40 more years for the first Black climber to summit Everest. Still, there has never been an all-Black team to summit the tallest mountain on Earth. 'This expedition will showcase the tenacity and strength of these climbers, and highlight the barriers that continue to exist for Black communities in accessing the outdoors.' Members of the group climbed the tough Mount Rainier in Washington last year, then after intense training they set off for the Himalayas. With a team of Sherpa climbers they reached base camp, then departed on 2 May for the summit. Some did not make the top, but seven did, on 12 May. 'This is a huge accomplishment ... now we're able to take this experience and take it back to our communities and tell the stories, share what we've learned of this beautiful place and culture and hopefully inspire a future generation of outdoor enthusiasts,' successful summiteer Rosemary Saal told Today on Thursday. Teammate Phil Richardson has been working in the climbing and mountaineering industry for almost three decades. 'When I came into it, there weren't folks like myself that I had to look to for guidance and mentorship and so on,' he said, adding that he was now in a position to mentor others.", "3a9fa698a0d08d37b129afbfcc5c7b8f5e97ff93409478245bbcaa80": "", "eecf5e63fab423f8ad5137544f8fffd16a425ef81d461cd91b2898e9": "On 26 April, Pakistan's first female suicide bomber killed three Chinese teachers and the driver of the minibus they were travelling in as she blew herself up in front of the Confucius Institute at the University of Karachi. The impacts have been felt far and wide. Chinese teachers working at the cultural and educational institutions have now left Pakistan, and in the restive province of Balochistan female activists are facing greater pressures, with three reported abductions this week. The attack was claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned secular militant group that has accused Pakistan and China of exploiting the resources of the south-western province for which it wants independence. The bomber was identified as Shari Baloch, from Kech in Balochistan, a teacher who held a postgraduate degree in zoology. It was a dramatic shift in the nature of Baloch militancy. It raised one main question from analysts: Shari Baloch came from an affluent and educated family, none of whom had been killed or gone missing in the crackdown on the insurgency. What pushed her to go to kill herself and others? Her brother said she never spoke of the insurgency or joining the militants. 'None of us could imagine she would take such a step, it was shocking for us,' he said. 'Shari never shared such extremist thoughts or ideologies with us. She was the happiest sister among all.' Baloch women have been leading a peaceful protest movement against the extrajudicial killing and abduction of their male family members but had not taken part in the separatist insurgency started in the early 2000s. People suspected of being an insurgent or a sympathiser, including political workers, students and activists, were abducted and sometimes tortured and murdered. According to the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), more than 5,000 people have gone missing since 2000. Activists and family members have accused security agencies of the abductions and extrajudicial killings but the security agencies have denied any involvement. After the Karachi attack, the bomber's husband, Dr Haibatan Bashir, a dentist, went into hiding with his two children. He said he had known of his wife's plan. 'Shari informed me around two years ago about her decision. There are multiple factors behind her decision,' he said. She chose 'Bramsh' as her alias, the name of a four-year-old child whose mother was killed by a private militia in 2020. Two other deaths in 2020 - those of Hayat Baloch, a student of the University of Karachi killed in Turbat by a Frontier Corps soldier, and Karima Baloch, a political worker who mysteriously died in exile in Canada and was buried in her home town under a curfew - had a deep impact on her.  When Shari Baloch learned of Karima Baloch's death, she called her husband. 'I remember she was very upset. She told me that the enemy cannot even accept peaceful methods of politics,' he said. These incidents started a wave of protests against the state and the security forces. 'She believed people in Balochistan were living under oppression,' Bashir said. His wife used to say that 'innocent Baloch are killed and abducted and these brutalities will reach our family if we do nothing', he said. A close friend of Shari Baloch told the Guardian that Shari had once said to her that 'our men are humiliated, tortured and abducted. I wish we had died before witnessing such humiliations.' China expressed 'its strong condemnation and great indignation at this major terrorist attack' after the bombing. The dead were the Karachi institute's director and two other faculty members. The Pakistani prime minister, Shahbaz Sharif, wrote in a handwritten letter to the Chinese embassy that 'we won't rest until the culprits are hunted down and given exemplary punishment'. Baloch women have been the face of peaceful political movements for many years but now they fear they will be abducted like their male relatives. Noor Jahan, 40, was picked up from her home in Kech, Balochistan, by counter-terrorism police on Monday. The police claimed she was planning an attack and said they recovered a cache of weapons from her. The police report, which the Guardian has seen, claims she is affiliated with the BLA. Hundreds of men and women blocked a main road in Kech and refused to move until Jahan was released. Her whereabouts are still unknown. On Thursday it was reported that Habiba Pir Mohammad, a poet, had been abducted in Karachi by security forces during an early morning raid. Sammi Deen Baloch, who has been campaigning for the release of her father, Dr Deen Mohammed, who has been missing since 2009, said Shari Baloch's attack had provided an excuse for the state to start picking up women, missing persons' families and peaceful protesters and registering fake cases against them. 'We have nothing to do with violence and we don't support it. We just demand an end to enforced disappearances and for suspects to be treated according to law by presenting them in courts,' she said. Zafar Musyani, a researcher on Balochistan, said the detention of Jahan showed that this kind of trend was in the offing. 'Before Shari Baloch, state authorities couldn't profile or portray a Baloch woman as an insurgent. Now they have got a precedent set by Shari to support any crackdown on Baloch women by labelling them as insurgents.'", "1158121bde1e1c2583b1e74732233caf38984104e6b94d15733e7129": "", "4273171285ec05cfbc628b3a85598a037b1cb114b27a5d1f97be5c27": "The United Nations has warned that the war in Ukraine has helped to stoke a global food crisis that could last years if it goes unchecked, as the World Bank announced an additional $12bn in funding to mitigate its 'devastating effects'. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said shortages of grain and fertiliser caused by the war, warming temperatures and pandemic-driven supply problems threaten to 'tip tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity', as financial markets saw share prices fall heavily again on fears of inflation and a worldwide recession. Speaking at a UN meeting in New York on global food security, he said what could follow would be 'malnutrition, mass hunger and famine, in a crisis that could last for years', as he and others urged Russia to release Ukrainian grain exports. He said he was in 'intense contact' with Russia and other countries to try to find a solution. 'The complex security, economic and financial implications require goodwill on all sides for a package deal to be reached,' he said of his discussions with Moscow, Ukraine, Turkey, the US, the European Union and others. 'I will not go into details because public statements could undermine the chances of success.' Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and international economic sanctions on Russia have disrupted supplies of fertiliser, wheat and other commodities from both countries, pushing up prices for food and fuel, especially in developing nations. Together the warring nations produce 30% of the world's wheat. Before the invasion in February, Ukraine was seen as the world's bread basket, exporting 4.5m tonnes of agricultural produce per month through its ports - 12% of the planet's wheat, 15% of its corn and half of its sunflower oil. But with the ports of Odesa, Chornomorsk and others cut off from the world by Russian warships, the supply can travel only on congested land routes that are far less efficient. Prices have skyrocketed. The UN's food and agricultural price index reached an all-time high of almost 160 points in March before falling 1.2 or 0.8% in April. Cereal and meat price indices also hit record highs in March. A year ago wheat was trading in Chicago at US674c per bushel. Today it fetches US1,242c per bushel in a near-doubling of the price driven and compounded by the lack of supply. 'Let's be clear: there is no effective solution to the food crisis without reintegrating Ukraine's food production,' Guterres said. 'Russia must permit the safe and secure export of grain stored in Ukrainian ports.' US secretary of state Antony Blinken, who chaired the summit, echoed the call along with World Food Programme head David Beasley. Beasley said: 'The world is on fire. We have solutions. We need to act and we need to act now.' In other Ukraine developments: Soaring energy prices have also played a part in the current crisis by making it more expensive to produce fertiliser and to run farm equipment. Russia is the world's top supplier of certain fertilisers and natural gas. The fertilisers are not subject to the western sanctions, but sales have been disrupted by measures taken against the Russian financial system while Moscow has also restricted exports, diplomats say. Guterres also said Russian food and fertilisers 'must have full and unrestricted access to world markets'. The World Bank's announcement will bring total available funding for projects over the next 15 months to $30bn. The new funding will help boost food and fertiliser production, facilitate greater trade and support vulnerable households and producers, the World Bank said. The bank previously announced $18.7bn in funding for projects linked to 'food and nutrition security issues' for Africa and the Middle East, eastern Europe and central Asia, and south Asia. 'Countries should make concerted efforts to increase the supply of energy and fertiliser, help farmers increase plantings and crop yields, and remove policies that block exports and imports, divert food to biofuel, or encourage unnecessary storage,' said World Bank president David Malpass. Financial markets have reflected fears about how disruption from the war will affect the world economy with stocks on Wall Street falling precipitously on Wednesday. The broadest index, the S&P500, dropped 4.04% in its worst day for nearly two years after retailers led by Target said that supply chain problems and inflation - currently 8% in the US - were eating into profits. The losses sparked more selling in Asia Pacific at the start of trading on Thursday. The Hang Seng dropped 3% to take the index below 20,000 points for the first time in more than five years, while the Nikkei was off 2.5% in Tokyo and Seoul was down 1.55%. Hebe Chen, market analyst at IG in Sydney, said: 'It must be said that the concern for inflation has never gone away since we stepped into 2022, however, while things haven't reached the point of no return, they are seemingly heading in the direction of 'out of control'. That, is probably the most worrying part for the market.'", "9fb7bd846406b5420e49fbf6940902389c9ec4925067dda9c788cad4": "", "71615e50a3897b734a35ea2f1482e9ca709f65a9234b9cd7ac08939f": "More than 900 Ukrainian troops who were at Mariupol's besieged Azovstal steel plant have been sent to a prison colony on Russian-controlled territory, Moscow has said, as their fate remains uncertain. A foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said on Wednesday evening that of the 959 Ukrainian service personnel Russia said had surrendered since Tuesday, 51 were being treated for their injuries and the remainder had been sent to a former prison colony in the town of Olenivka in a Russian-controlled area of Donetsk region. Russia's defence ministry also released videos on Wednesday of what it said were Ukrainian fighters receiving hospital treatment in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk after surrendering at the besieged Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. In the videos, a group of men were shown lying on beds in a room, and two spoke briefly to the camera. In one, a soldier said he was being treated 'normally', adding that he was not being psychology pressured. It was not possible to establish if the soldier was speaking freely. Zakharova told journalists all the wounded Azovstal soldiers 'will be provided with qualified medical care'. Ukraine has not commented on Russia's latest update. In his address to the nation late on Tuesday, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said an 'evacuation mission' was continuing with help from 'the most influential international mediators'. It is also not clear how many remain inside the plant. Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk, said on Wednesday that the 'commanders of the highest level' were still hiding in the plant. Earlier, Ukrainian officials had said some of its soldiers remained. The two sides in the war have released practically no details of the agreement that led to the surrender of the troops, who were holed up for weeks in an extensive network of tunnels and bunkers underneath the steelworks. Ukraine's deputy defence minister said on Tuesday the soldiers would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but a number of Russian officials on Wednesday repeated statements made a day earlier by other hardliners that the soldiers should be tried. Pushilin on Wednesday called on an 'international tribunal' to be set to decide the soldiers' 'fate'. 'As for war criminals as well as those who are nationalists, their fate, if they laid down their arms, should be decided by the courts,' he said. 'If the enemy has laid down arms, then his fate will be decided by the courts. If it is a Nazi criminal, then it's a tribunal.' The Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, whose forces have participated in the battle for Mariupol, said the Azov regiment, one of the main forces defending the steelworks, should not be exchanged and 'must be punished by law'. Speaking at an educational forum in Moscow, Kadyrov said Russian forces were facing some 'difficulties' in Ukraine as a result of Nato arms deliveries to the country. It was the second statement by a Russian official on Wednesday that acknowledged some of the Russian military failings in Ukraine after Rashid Nurgaliyev, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, said that 'despite all the current difficulties, the special operation will be completed'. The Azov regiment was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and its commanders say it has moved away from its far-right origins. The Russian Duma is expected to discuss the subject this week and potentially accept a new resolution that would ban prisoner exchanges of Azov fighters. Next week, Russia's supreme court will also hear an application to designate Ukraine's Azov regiment as a 'terrorist organisation', opening the way for sentences of up to 20 years for those convicted of involvement. Russia's Investigative Committee, which exists to examine major crimes, has already announced plans to interrogate the surrendered soldiers, without indicating whether they would be treated as suspects. The fate of the forces taken prisoner at Azovstal could further complicate efforts to resume peace negotiations, with both sides blaming each other for a breakdown in talks. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused Ukraine of a 'total lack of desire' to continue the negotiations, while the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said talks were on hold . The Azov movement has been used as a key part of the Russian propaganda narrative to justify the war in Ukraine, and Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center said Russian politicians were using their surrender 'to promote themselves and show their loyalty to the Kremlin'. 'But ultimately, their statements don't matter much and it will be Putin who decides what happens to the Ukrainian soldiers,' Kolesnikov added. He said what Putin chose to do with the Azovstal soldiers could point to his current intentions in the conflict. 'If he decides to try the soldiers, it will be a clear, worrying sign that he is willing to further escalate the situation. It will be a spit in Zelenskiy's face.' Alternatively, Kolesnikov said, trading soldiers with Ukraine would be framed domestically as a Russian 'act of mercy and compassion' despite the current calls by Putin's hardliners demanding severe punishment for the soldiers. 'At home, Putin has flexibility and could play both cards,' Kolesnikov said.", "8ddb0aeff08f149d8aad79143136a40ae20c02234814b6bfcd9e784f": "After initial hesitation about the seriousness of Turkey's objections, its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has doubled down on his threat to veto Finland's and Sweden's applications for membership of Nato, saying there is no point in either country sending delegations to Ankara to persuade him otherwise. On Wednesday, he also extended his demands from the two he outlined on Monday to 10, leading to claims that he is using blackmail. At his press conference on Monday, he made two key demands: that Finland and Sweden end their supposed support for the Kurdish Workers' party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation, and that they lift their ban on arms exports imposed in October 2019 after the Turkish incursion in northern Syria. No one doubts that Erdogan's intervention could tangle Nato up in knots for months. It is now the task of alliance diplomats to establish Erdogan's seriousness and the price that would have to be paid to make him back down, and prevent a full-blown Nato crisis. The Swedish foreign minister, Ann Linde, initially hoped that something had got lost in translation after she had been quoted in the Turkish press saying the Turks regard all Kurds as terrorists. Linde said on Sunday she had never made these remarks, had never met the PKK, and would not do so. She was cautiously optimistic that any misunderstanding could be cleared up, but by Wednesday it was clear her reassurances were falling short of what Erdogan requires.  The Nordic political class initially appeared sceptical about Erdogan's seriousness. Finland's president, Sauli Niinisto, said he spoke with Erdogan a month ago and none of his current concerns were aired. It was also being said that no early warning flares were sent up by Turkey's Nato ambassador, Basat Ozturk. But that assessment is changing. Jonathan Eyal, the associate director of the Rusi thinktank, said Erdogan 'lives on the edge and operates through brinkmanship'. Eyal added: 'Many of his demands about the PKK are part of a familiar Turkish tune. But he has domestic reasons to be standing up to America. The economy is in tatters and his popularity is at an all time low.' With inflation at 66.9% and facing elections next summer, there is no harm galvanising the nationalist vote, but that is not to say Erdogan's complaints are entirely synthetic. On Monday, the Turkish justice ministry identified six alleged PKK members it is seeking to extradite from Finland and 11 from Sweden. Add in people accused by Turkey of supporting the US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestrating the 2016 coup attempt, and Turkey wants 12 people returned from Finland and 21 from Sweden. Nordic diplomats say this list was last presented in 2017 and has not been the subject of any Turkish lobbying in recent years. Turkish media has reported what it describes as other examples of a 'soft' Swedish attitude to terrorism, including evidence that the Syrian branch of the PKK has held meetings in Stockholm hosted by the Swedish foreign office and the Olof Palme International Center, a thinktank funded by Swedish trade unions. Turkey also says that in 2019 PKK supporters held a protest in a shopping centre in support of the jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan and Swedish security forces did nothing to prevent them from carrying the PKK's 'flag' and pictures of Ocalan. Eyal said it would be hard for the Nordic countries to bow to these complaints. 'It is not possible for either country ... to change its domestic legislation on freedom of assembly,' he said. 'Sweden in particular has an active Kurdish community that has political support. This episode is reminiscent of 2009 when Erdogan said he would not allow Anders Rasmussen to be appointed Nato's secretary general unless Denmark closed a Kurdish TV station. Rasmussen was appointed but a year later the TV station was closed.' Some similar delayed behind-the-scenes deal could happen this time. Neither country can simply tear up its own internal asylum systems and Sweden says it does do not run independent terrorist lists different from those compiled at EU level. Eyal argues Erdogan's target is as likely to be the US as Finland and Sweden. Turkey's 2017 purchase of Russia's S-400 missile defence system turned it into a pariah in the US and led to Ankara being kicked out of the F-35 stealth fighter jet programme. The recent rumours, denied by Moscow, that Vladimir Putin might visit Ankara in the near future were probably another signal from Ankara that it has cards to play. But it is precisely this double game that leaves so many other Nato states frustrated with Erdogan's brinkmanship.", "6773d1d37baf96fa54d056ee86d17c05c5382827df55b919bdab573d": "The EU plans a 'massive' increase in solar and wind power, and a short-term boost for coal, to end its reliance on Russian oil and gas as fast as possible. In a plan outlined on Wednesday, the European Commission said the EU needed to find an extra EUR210bn (PS178bn) over the next five years to pay for phasing out Russian fossil fuels and speeding up the switch to green energy. Senior officials conceded that in the short term, the race to get off Russian gas would mean burning more coal and nuclear energy. The plan, drawn up in response to the Kremlin-ordered invasion of Ukraine and subsequent soul-searching about Europe's dependence on Russian gas, proposes upgrades to the EU green deal, the bloc's flagship policy to confront the climate crisis. The Commission proposed that 45% of the EU's energy mix should come from renewables by 2030, an advance on the current 40% target suggested less than a year ago. Officials also want to cut energy consumption by 13% by 2030 (compared with 2020), in comparison with the current proposal of a 9% saving. 'It is clear we need to put an end to this dependence and a lot faster before we had foreseen before this war,' said Frans Timmermans, the EU official in charge of the green deal. Contrasting the call to find EUR210bn to spend on new energy infrastructure, including windfarms and solar panels, he said the EU was spending EUR100bn a year on Russian fossil fuels. 'Speeding up the transition means that money can stay in Europe, can help bring down the energy bills of European families and will not be used to finance this barbaric war in Ukraine.' But phasing out Russian gas means coal-fired power plants 'might also be used longer than initially expected', states the EU strategy. The decision to quit Russian gas has also led to a scramble to increase Europe's imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from countries such as the US and Qatar, as well as pipeline gas from Azerbaijan. The commission said it would be necessary to spend up to EUR12bn - about 6% of the extra EUR210bn needed - to build LNG terminals and upgrade oil plants to allow EU member states to switch to non-Russian fossil fuels. Timmermans said the EU could still meet its target of net zero emissions by 2050. 'You might use coal a bit longer, that has a negative impact on your emissions,' adding: 'If we can actually do what I say, reduce our energy consumption in combination with a speedier introduction of renewables, we will bring down our emissions even quicker than before.' The Dutch MEP Bas Eickhout, a vice-chair of the European parliament's environment committee, said the commission was leaving the door open for member states to continue funding fossil fuel infrastructure. 'Investments that are urgently needed for energy efficiency and renewables can still flow into new pipelines and terminals, this might continue our fossil energy dependency,' he said. Green campaigners voiced concern about plans to source LNG from states in the Middle East and Caucasus with poor human rights records, while criticising the green light for new gas infrastructure. 'The more we spend importing gas, the more we continue to expose the most vulnerable in our society to unaffordable energy bills, fuel the climate crisis and fund other repressive fossil-fuelled regimes around the world,' said Murray Worthy at Global Witness. To help speed up renewable energy, the EU wants to make it easier for companies to build wind and solar farms. Officials said it could take up to nine years to get a permit for a windfarm and four for solar. 'And this is time we do not have,' said one. Any change in planning laws would require action from national and local authorities.", "efcd3daa1642369fe66e4d2c95b165b8d91b98fdc3200d4939d4d500": "Any Russian moves to prosecute and potentially execute some of the hundreds of Ukrainian fighters who surrendered in Mariupol could be in breach of the Geneva conventions, which state that prisoners of war should not be punished for having taken part in hostilities. The concerns were underlined by the UK's armed forces minister, James Heappey,who told the radio station LBC: 'I think there have been enough atrocities in this war already without seeing the execution or whatever of the prisoners of war, which I fear this is a prelude to. I just think we have to be very clear, that sort of atrocity the west would stand in utter condemnation of. Prisoners of war have a status enshrined in the Geneva convention.' Among those who have called for the prosecution of the fighters who have been leaving the sprawling Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol is the pro-Russia Donetsk separatist leader Denis Pushilin, who said on Wednesday that a court would decide their fate. The Geneva conventions comprise four treaties and three protocols establishing international legal standards for humanitarian treatment during wars. The single term Geneva convention usually refers to the agreements negotiated in 1949 after the second world war. The 1949 convention says PoWs must not be prosecuted for their direct part in hostilities, and makes clear that detention after capture should not be seen as a form of punishment but a means to prevent further participation in the conflict. The only permissible exception is that the detaining power may prosecute prisoners for possible war crimes. One of Russia's claimed justifications for its war of aggression against Ukraine was that members of the Azov regiment in Mariupol were responsible for war crimes. Early on in the battle for the port city, the Russian defence spokesperson Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov claimed: 'It was these Azov battalion Nazis who had been exterminating civilian population in Donetsk and Luhansk republics, deliberately and with exceptional cruelty, for eight years.'  Concern over the potential fate of some of the Ukrainian soldiers has been raised after threats by Russian officials to treat them as 'terrorists' rather than combatants. Although Vladimir Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, promised that the fighters who surrendered would be treated 'in accordance with international standards', this was immediately undermined by statements from other Russian officials. 'Nazi criminals should not be exchanged,' said Vyacheslav Volodin, the chair of the State Duma, in a speech on Tuesday, referring to Ukrainian offers of a prisoner exchange. 'Our country treats those who surrendered or were captured humanely. But with regards to Nazis, our position should be unchanged: these are war criminals and we must do everything so that they stand trial.' Russia's justice ministry appealed to the supreme court to declare the Azov regiment a terrorist organisation on Tuesday, possibly introducing another hurdle to a potential exchange. Azov has been a key part of the Russian propaganda narrative about the war in Ukraine, which was originally launched with the supposed goal of 'denazification'. It was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and its commanders say it has moved away from its far-right origins. Both sides in the conflict have been accused of breaches of the Geneva conventions in their treatment of prisoners. Matilda Bogner, the head of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, said there was 'credible information' of mistreatment of prisoners. 'We have received credible information of torture, ill-treatment and incommunicado detention by Ukrainian armed forces of prisoners of war belonging to the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups,' Bogner said. Soldiers were 'being coerced to make statements, apologies and confessions, and [subjected to] other forms of humiliation,' she said.", "cc06f5f54d4fd83ee1cc42aeaf53b7e6c408a0bd759c55eea116c583": "Finland and Sweden have submitted their applications for Nato membership triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Seven people share their thoughts on what Nato membership would mean for them, and how they feel about the Russia-Ukraine war. I feel I speak for many Finns when I say we are choosing the lesser of two evils. I have never been a fan of Nato but Putin has left us no option. He trashed the trust and made it clear that Russia is not only callous and cruel, but its regime is also highly unpredictable in its irredentist adventures. Some Finns have always wanted to join Nato. I can understand that, but I think neutrality served us well over the years. Russia just made it impossible to carry on. One problem is that because these seismic shifts have been so fast, we've never had the time to properly discuss what our role or place in the alliance would be: should we follow the US interests as closely as possible, like Denmark? Or build closer ties with Estonia and [the other] Baltics? Or try to build on a similar peaceful mediator role as before? Mikael Viljanen, 45, teacher, Helsinki, Finland We should have joined Nato as early as the Baltic countries did. In Finland we are used to trusting what has been agreed - even someone's spoken word is enough. The leaders of Russia have shown now very clearly that they act just the opposite. At the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war I felt deeply desperate and even paralysed. I experienced similar things when I was a child when my father fought against Russians on the frontline as a medic in the war between the Soviet Union and Finland. In Finland there are a lot of people of Russian origin - most of them do not want war. I feel deep sorrow for the ordinary people in Ukraine and Russia who are suffering. Juhani Viherlahti, 80, chief executive and entrepreneur, Espoo, Finland It's all happened too fast as if there was absolutely no other choice. I feel we've missed out the possibility of peace. Joining Nato seems very shortsighted from the point of a view of a humanist and pacifist. I feel our country will be less safe and Helsinki could become an easy target for Putin. Katja, 56, psychotherapist, Helsinki, Finland My preference is for Finland and Sweden to remain independent from Nato, have no US troops or other weapons as they are not needed or wanted. But with the Russia-Ukraine war it was time to apply to join. I don't think highly of Nato or what it does. If Finland is allowed to become a member I think there should be no Nato base in the country. Finland has to state that it will remain as a defensive country within Nato, as we're not into war like the UK, US and others. Russia has complained and made threats since Finland became independent. Sometimes we think Russia should shut up, have a sauna, a beer, and relax. Leif Vaisanen, 42, property renovator, Oulu, Finland Sweden has been neutral for more than 200 years. I think it's a mistake to break that neutrality; a Nato membership will not be good for us in the long run. It seems the decision is either out of fear of a Russian invasion, or out of spite because Russia told us not to. Either way, fear or spite is not a good enough reason to make such a major decision this quickly. I would not want to be responsible should one of the other Nato nations do something stupid. It would be scary to have such a close military relationship with a country such as Turkey. Maria, 22, works for a textile company, Gothenburg, Sweden I think that the decision has been taken far too rapidly and without real possibility of democratic influence from other political parties. Firstly, the social democrats do not want the Nato question to be a question under debate in the run-up to the election in September. Secondly, they have been successful during Covid to portray themselves as the party that acts appropriately in times of crisis and they want to continue doing so. Nevertheless, they are abandoning 200 years of neutrality which has served Sweden well. I feel like this is the last part of an ongoing abandonment of the Swedish folkhemmet in which a strong and alliance-free state took care of its citizens. I feel a longing for a society that is now being lost. I also think that there will be a price to pay for Nato protection. Statements by [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan are already signalling what that might be. I think Russia has little interest in Sweden besides if we join Nato - not joining is probably more secure. Karolina Enquist Kallgren, 30s, associate professor, Stockholm, Sweden As a Finn residing in Sweden with a Swedish spouse, we are both sad that Nato wasn't buried simultaneously with the Warsaw pact. They are both products of a bygone era. EU should have developed a strong European military union already back then. Regrettably, it's too late for that now. Neighbouring countries such as Iceland, Norway and Denmark have participated in a military alliance led by Washington - for what appears to be no visible benefit to any of them. Today's situation is awful but we have no choice but to take the leap into Nato because some people in the west have allowed the dictatorship in Russia to flourish. Of course, Putin's guilt is indisputable. Russia must be stopped.

People fleeing violence were internally displaced 14.4m times in 2021, an increase of 4.6m on 2020, according to figures published by the Norwegian Refugee Council's Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC). Most of those displacements - 11.6m, or 80% of the total - took place in sub-Saharan African countries, with the war in northern Ethiopia dwarfing other conflicts in terms of the number of times people were forced from their homes. Alexandra Bilak, IDMC director, said the geographic concentration of the conflict-related displacement across sub-Saharan Africa, from the Sahel to east Africa, was a huge concern. 'These are, of course, countries that have experienced long histories of conflict, but what these numbers show is that the conflicts are far from having been resolved,' she said. 'So on top of protracted crises, you get new waves of violence every year. In Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, we're talking huge spikes of new violence that have led to incredibly large numbers being displaced and, at least for now, very little prospect for returns.' New flare-ups of violence often collided with climate pressures such as drought or flooding, and resulting food insecurity, making it even harder for countries to give internally displaced people (IDPs) the help they needed, she said. 'There's absolutely no window during which some kind of stabilisation could happen, and some degree of return or sustainable local integration. These constant shocks to the system mean that the numbers keep increasing.' According to the report, there were 59.1 million IDPs globally in 2021, a cumulative figure, which has grown steadily since the IDMC began documenting in 2003. Every year more displacement is caused by natural disasters than conflict, but last year the number of forced movements due to disasters such as such as storms, floods and volcanic eruptions - 23.7 million - was down considerably on 2020. The number of times people were forced from their homes by violence was of particular concern to the IDMC. As the report deals with 2021, the figures do not include the huge humanitarian fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where more than 7 million people are thought to be internally displaced. The only place to rival that scale of displacement was Ethiopia, where conflict - chiefly war between government forces and Tigrayan rebels in the north of the country - triggered 5.1m internal displacements. Until the invasion of Ukraine, that was the highest annual figure ever recorded for a single country. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which saw 2.7m displacements due to conflict, and Afghanistan, where the Taliban toppled Ashraf Ghani's government, also registered all-time highs. The volatile situation in Myanmar, where the military staged a bloody coup, helped triple the overall figure for east Asia compared with the previous year. With more than half the global IDP population under 25, and about 25 million under 18, the IDMC called for more targeted interventions to protect children and young people from the particular dangers they face. 'The financial difficulties IDPs tend to face may force children to engage in dangerous income-generating activities, including crime, transactional sex or joining armed groups,' the report notes. 'Strengthening child protection systems that consider these risks is essential.' Displaced girls and boys, it adds, confront different risks, with girls at greater risk of sexual violence and child marriage, and boys of recruitment by fighters. Bilak hoped the report would raise awareness of the worsening plight of IDPs, which historically had received 'much less attention' from governments and policymakers than that of refugees or migrants. 'This is, first and foremost, a call for acknowledgment of the scale ... and the urgency of the issue,' she said. Faced with the stark increase in conflict-related displacement, she added, the IDMC urged greater investment in peace-building, 'and in preventing those conflicts from happening in the first place'.", "2ee0fa8729c38097449acbe286ee4e8aa4852020c6fe435e698657b4": "The policing minister, Kit Malthouse, has disputed the chief inspector of constabulary Andy Cooke's suggestion that the cost of living crisis will trigger an increase in crime, branding it 'old-fashioned' thinking. As inflation hit a 40-year-high of 9%, Cooke told the Guardian that officers should use their 'discretion' when deciding whether to prosecute people who steal in order to eat. Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Malthouse, a longtime ally of Boris Johnson, said Cooke's thinking was 'old-fashioned', adding: 'Because people are challenged financially ... that doesn't necessarily mean they're going to turn to crime.' The chief inspector of constabulary is the head of the independent assessor of police forces in England and Wales. Cooke, a former chief constable of Merseyside police, took over from Sir Tom Winsor in the role last month. Malthouse has told officers not to let shoplifters off if they are stealing food out of desperation during the cost of living crisis. He later told LBC ministers would ensure police do not turn a blind eye to shoplifters stealing food. 'In fact I wrote to chief constables just a year or so ago saying they should not be ignoring those seemingly small crimes,' he said. Earlier, the minister told Times Radio: 'The broad rule is that justice should be blind and I hope and believe that is the principle that sits behind not just the police but the operation of the courts as well. 'I have to challenge this connection between poverty and crime. What we've found in the past, and where there is now growing evidence, is that actually crime is a contributor to poverty. That if you remove the violence and the crime from people's lives they generally prosper more than they otherwise would.' Cooke told the Guardian: 'The impact of poverty, and the impact of lack of opportunity for people, does lead to an increase in crime. There's no two ways about that.' When asked how policing could avoid being seen as the arm of an uncaring state, he said forces across England and Wales were skilled in dealing with the tensions and dynamics of their communities. 'What they've got to bear in mind is what is the best thing for the community, and that individual, in the way they deal with those issues. And I certainly fully support police officers using their discretion - and they need to use discretion more often.'", "d4d33c73f913d07052356648b843ff7ab3d1cbb4d3145d271a9b13de": "Climate change and rising costs are causing supermarkets in France to run out of dijon mustard, raising questions over whether the shortage could spread to other countries. French mustard producers said seed production in 2021 was down 50% after poor harvests, which they said had been brought on by the changing climate in France's Burgundy region and Canada - the second largest mustard seed producer in the world. It has caused French supermarket shelves to run empty of the condiment, including in several stores visited by the Guardian. One of France's largest mustard producers, Reine de Dijon, said the shortages were being driven by climate breakdown. The group's general manager, Luc Vandermaesen, said a 'heat dome' in Canada at the beginning of July in 2021 had 'really dried up the crops'. He added: 'In Burgundy, the region had a very wet winter and then three days of cold at the beginning of April last year, so we only harvested about 48% of expectations.' The war in Ukraine has further restricted seed supply, with both Ukraine and Russia being major exporters of the crop, something which has seen costs rocket, said Vandermaesen. The group tried to purchase 50 tonnes of seed on the market in April, which he said was 'six times the normal price the year before'. Burgundy-based dijon producer, Edmond Fallot, also said that additional cost pressures surrounding raw materials were having an impact on production. A spokesperson for the group said: 'Since Burgundy is a quite small region, we are even more exposed if the weather is bad. We also suffer from heavy tensions on raw materials markets [such as] glass, paper, wine, carton, which is slowing down production.' The shortages in France raise questions over whether the UK market could suffer similar supply issues, though retailers and producers appear calm for now. Morrison's described it as 'as industry-wide issue', while a spokesperson for Waitrose said they were working with suppliers but 'currently [had] a wide range of brands available'. British Retail Consortium, which represents UK retailers, said the impact was 'very limited at the moment'. It is understood, Maille, a popular dijon mustard brand in the UK, has experienced seed supply issues, while English mustard brand Colman's remains unaffected. Unilever, which owns both brands, declined to comment. David Martin, chief executive of Condimentum, a UK-based company which processes the bulk of UK mustard seed and supplies Unilever, said they had seen 'a huge spike in interest' from global brands looking for mustard seed and flour as a result of the supply issues overseas and after a strong UK harvest. He added that 2023 would be the year to watch, with uncertainty over whether Canadian farmers would stick with the crop or opt for something less risky. 'I suspect the global shortage in the short to medium term will just get worse and I think there will be some outages in terms of supermarket shelf availability,' he said.", "aab42672d50b2362d679b818beaa6dd6ae3aafebb2697800bf7d9bda": "Students at a school in Bremerhaven, northern Germany, used chairs and tables to barricade themselves in their classrooms after several shots were fired at the building, seriously injuring an adult woman.

Musk's tweet comes as the Tesla CEO shocked markets this week by announcing his $44bn deal to purchase Twitter was on hold as he awaited further data on fake and spam accounts on the social media platform. Analysts have speculated the Tesla executive is seeking to back out of his Twitter takeover plans, or buy the company at a lower price. His tweets since - including that he was buying the platform to 'own the libs' - have attracted further controversy. On Wednesday, Musk warned that political attacks against him would 'escalate' in the coming months and said he will no longer support Democrats because they were the party of 'division' and 'hate'. Musk, who says he is politically 'moderate', made a similar claim earlier this week, stating that he had long backed Democrats, but would now vote for Republicans. Musk has become increasingly critical of Joe Biden, who he has accused of snubbing his electric car company Tesla. He has also moved his home and company headquarters from California to Texas, where, unlike the Golden state, there is no state income tax.

A central London employment tribunal on Wednesday ordered the former member for Hartlepool Mike Hill to pay PS434,435 to Woman A. She was victimised after spurning Hill's advances, an employment tribunal ruled in July. He was found to have climbed into the victim's bed and sexually assaulted her in his parliamentary office. The case is the first public compensation payment ordered against an MP for sexual assault, and is expected to prompt other alleged victims in parliament to take action through the civil courts. It comes as Conservative officials come under increasing pressure to remove the whip from an MP arrested on Tuesday over claims of rape and sexual assault. Woman A told the Guardian that she hoped that Wednesday's order would encourage other women to come forward and seek justice through the courts as an alternative to the parliamentary process. 'It is important that the many women who have been sexually harassed and assaulted by MPs know that there is another way of seeking justice and compensation for their losses. 'The parliamentary investigation route, which I went through, is arduous and very tough and conducted in private. 'Pursuing Mike Hill through the courts has meant that I might receive compensation for my financial losses and the process seems much more open and transparent,' she said. Woman A said that the decision to take on Hill has nevertheless left her homeless, traumatised by PTSD, suffering from severe depressive disorder and with limited prospects of a career. 'I have gone through two and a half years of hell. I left my job with nothing while he took his pension, and several months pay and was covered by PS250,000 towards his legal fees. I had to crowdfund my case. The system, even through the courts, is weighted in favour of MPs,' she said. Woman A's barrister welcomed the ruling and said she will now seek to enforce the order against Hill's assets but may also sue the House of Commons if Hill is unable to pay. Suzanne McKie QC said: 'We will now look to enforce against Mr Hill's personal assets and take action against the House of Commons for the shortfall.' McKie told a remedy hearing in March that nearly all of the PS250,000 insurance policy that the Commons had put in place to cover an MP facing an employment claim had been spent on Hill's legal fees. She told the hearing that the Commons bore responsibility for failing to keep some money for her client's legal costs and compensation. 'Ms A now has to consider how to effect judgment against Mr Hill when there is almost nothing left in that pot of money, and whether to sue the House of Commons for failing to put in place a sufficiently protective policy,' McKie told the hearing. MPs are covered by a PS5m insurance policy if they are sued for libel or slander, but by a PS250,000 policy if an employee claims sexual harassment. Andrew Bridgen, the Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire who gave evidence on behalf of Woman A to the tribunal, said he will be raising the issue of MP's insurance with Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, and Karen Bradley, the chair of the procedure committee, about the implications of the case for parliament. 'The Ipsa insurance cover should be increased to at least PS1m and there should be a limit set on the amount that can be spent on defence lawyers' fees to ensure that there is sufficient funds for compensation and the applicant's legal costs,' he said. Hill, who was then married, conducted a campaign of sexual harassment and bullying against Woman A over a 16-month period in 2017 and 2018, according to a reserved judgment. He was in breach of the Equalities Act in subjecting the claimant 'to unwanted conduct of a sexual nature'. The breaches included a telephone call on the evening of 22 September 2017 in which he told the claimant he loved her; 'getting into bed with the claimant on 11 December 2017 and rubbing his erection against her'; and 'sexual assaults on occasions at the Westminster office'. He was also found to have victimised her with behaviour that included deactivating her security pass, ignoring her work-related text and emails, and terminating the claimant's employment while stating he would put notice on the flat they shared in a text message. Hill resigned as a Labour MP in March 2021, resulting in a May byelection in Hartlepool and a victory for the Conservatives.

The Defense Production Act order requires suppliers of formula manufacturers to fulfill orders from those companies before other customers, in an effort to eliminate production bottlenecks. Biden is also authorizing the defense department to use commercial aircraft to fly formula supplies that meet federal standards from overseas to the US, in what the White House is calling 'Operation Fly Formula'. Supplies of baby formula across the country have been severely curtailed in recent weeks after a February recall by Abbott Nutrition exacerbated supply chain disruptions among formula makers, leaving fewer options on store shelves and increasingly anxious parents struggling to find nutrition for their children. 'I know parents across the country are worried about finding enough formula to feed their babies,' Biden said in a video statement released by the White House. 'As a parent and as a grandparent, I know just how stressful that is.' Wednesday's announcement comes two days after the Food and Drug Administration said it was streamlining its review process to make it easier for foreign manufacturers to begin shipping more formula into the US. In a letter on Wednesday to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture, Biden directed the agencies to work with the Pentagon to identify overseas supply of formula that meets US standards over the next week, so that chartered defense department flights can swiftly fly it to the US. 'Imports of baby formula will serve as a bridge to this ramped-up production,' Biden wrote. Regulators said on Monday that they'd reached a deal to allow Abbott Nutrition to restart its Sturgis, Michigan, plant, the nation's largest formula plant, which has been closed since February due to contamination issues. The company must overhaul its safety protocols and procedures before resuming production. After getting the Food and Drug Administration's OK, Abbott said it would take eight to 10 weeks before new products began arriving in stores. The company didn't set a timeline to restart manufacturing. 'I've directed my team to do everything possible to ensure there's enough safe baby formula and that it is quickly reaching families that need it the most,' Biden said in the statement, calling it 'one of my top priorities'. The White House actions come as the Democratic-led House is expected to approve two bills on Wednesday addressing the baby formula shortage as lawmakers look to show progress on what has become a frightening development for many families. One bill expected to have wide bipartisan support would give the agriculture secretary the ability to issue a narrow set of waivers in the event of a supply disruption. The goal is to give participants in an assistance program commonly known as WIC the ability to use vouchers to purchase formula from any producer rather than be limited to one brand that may be unavailable. The WIC program accounts for about half of infant formula sales in the US. The other measure, a $28m emergency spending bill to boost resources at the FDA, is expected to have less bipartisan support and it's unclear whether the Senate will take it up. 'This is throwing more FDA staff at a problem that needs more production, not more FDA staff,' said the Michigan Republican representative Bill Huizenga. Rosa DeLauro, the Democratic chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said the money would increase FDA staffing to boost inspections of domestic and international suppliers, prevent fraudulent products from getting on to store shelves and acquire better data on the marketplace. Abbott's voluntary recall was triggered by four illnesses reported in babies who had consumed powdered formula from its plant. All four infants were hospitalized with a rare type of bacterial infection and two died. After a six-week inspection, FDA investigators published a list of problems in March, including lax safety and sanitary standards and a history of bacterial contamination in several parts of the plant. Under Monday's agreement, Abbott must regularly consult with an outside safety expert to restart and maintain production. Chicago-based Abbott has emphasized that its products have not been directly linked to the bacterial infections in children. Samples of the bacteria found at its plant did not match the strains collected from two babies by federal investigators. But FDA officials pushed back on that reasoning Monday on a call with reporters - their first time publicly addressing the company's argument. FDA staffers noted they had been unable to collect bacterial strains from two of the four patients, limiting their chances of finding a match. 'Right from the get-go we were limited in our ability to determine with a causal link whether the product was linked to these four cases because we only had sequences on two,' the FDA's food director, Susan Mayne, said. Fixing the violations uncovered at Abbott's plant will take time, according to former FDA officials. Companies need to exhaustively clean the facility and equipment, retrain staff, repeatedly test and document there is no contamination. As part of the FDA's new import policy, regulators said companies would need to provide documentation of their factories' inspections.

Your first reaction is to protest. I protested, insisting that bipolar disorder is one of those notions that are all of a sudden in vogue and get pinned on anything and everything. Then you read what you can on the subject, you re-examine your whole life from that angle, and you realise that the shoe fits. Perfectly, even. That all your life you've been subject to this alternation of excitement and depression that is of course all of our lot - because all our moods change, we all have highs and lows, clear skies and dark clouds - only that there's a group of people to which you belong, along with, it seems, 2% of the population, for whom the highs are higher and the lows lower than average, to the point that their succession becomes pathological. However, where the description doesn't fit at first glance has to do with the so-called 'manic' phase of what until the 90s was called manic depressive psychosis. The manic state is when people strip naked on the street, or suddenly buy three Ferraris, or feverishly explain to anyone who wants to hear it that what they've got to do is eat guavas, lots and lots of guavas, to save humanity from a third world war. I knew a young guy who did things like that and who, once the crisis had passed, was appalled by what he'd done. He killed himself, as it seems up to 20% of people with bipolar disorder do. I felt sorry for this brilliant, desperate young guy, and never thought I suffered from the same disorder as he did. I was depressive, yes. In addition to what can be called empty periods, I've been through two phases of real, severe depression, the sort that lasts for several months, and during which you hardly ever get up, you can no longer accomplish the most basic tasks, and above all you can no longer imagine that things will change. That's the hallmark of depression: you can't believe that one day you'll get better. Well-meaning friends say: 'You'll be fine, you'll see.' But you only look at them with dismay and even start to resent them: they're so wide of the mark. It's so clear they haven't got a clue. When you're in a depression you think that you'll never come out of it, that you won't come out alive, that the only way out is suicide. If you don't kill yourself, however, sooner or later you will come out of it, and then once you're out of it you cross over into the camp of the well-meaning friends and can no longer imagine this state of intolerable and seemingly endless distress.

I said this to reassure myself, it was reasonable and true, but at the same time I wondered: 'Can I hold on until then? In eight or 10 hours will I still be alive?' I lived through it, and I know that once you're back among the living you put this hell into perspective, you quickly forget the horror. As Louis-Ferdinand Celine puts it in Journey to the End of the Night, 'The biggest defeat in every department of life is to forget, especially the things that have done you in.' Anyway. Unfortunately for me, I'm no stranger to depression. But what I still didn't know during my first psychiatric consultations is that, in the definition of bipolar disorder, the pole opposite the dive into depression isn't necessarily a state of spectacular euphoria and disinhibition that leads to social suicide and often to suicide itself, but just as frequently what psychiatrists call hypomania, which means in plain language that you act like a fool, but not to the same extent. You're bipolar type 2: agitated without necessarily being euphoric, but sometimes also seductive, flirtatious, very sexual, outwardly very much alive, but inclined to make the type of decisions you regret the most, while being dead sure that they're right and that you'll never go back on them. Then after that you're dead sure of the very opposite, you realise that you've done the worst thing possible, you try to fix it and do something even worse. You think one thing and then its opposite, you do one thing and then its opposite, in frightening succession. But the worst is that if you're like me and are used to analysing yourself, once the diagnosis has been reached and the mood swings identified, you gain hindsight - only this hindsight is of little use. Or if it is, it's just to see that no matter what you think, say or do, you can't trust yourself because there are two of you in the same person, and those two are enemies. It was totally predictable, since manic excitement is invariably followed by a dive into depression. An atrocious period. In the first phase I was elated at the prospect of a new book and a new life, full of promises and conquests. I rented quite a nice apartment on the Rue du Faubourg Poissonniere in Paris. I bought a Bluetooth speaker and took out a subscription to Deezer, both of which I imagined, oddly enough, as attributes of my new life. Then I end up as lonely as a rat, without a woman, or impotent when by chance I bring one home, my neck covered in dandruff, my cock blistered with herpes, unable to write, having lost all faith in a book project which a few weeks earlier seemed so right, so necessary, so doable, as all I had to do was start by describing what was happening to me. The problem is that I don't know what's happening to me, and I'm no longer able to tell myself or anyone else anything at all. To live, you need a story, and I no longer have one. My life is reduced to the path between my bed, where I bathe in a terrible sweat, and the terrace of the Cafe Le Rallye where I spend hours smoking cigarette after cigarette in a dazed stupor. Even today I can't walk past this cafe without a shudder. For almost two months I barely washed or changed my clothes. The bathtub got clogged and I did nothing to fix it, and even when I went to bed I barely changed out of my depressed man's garb: shapeless corduroy trousers, an old sweater full of holes, trainers whose laces I'd removed as if in anticipation of the precautions that would soon be imposed on me in psychiatric hospital. I don't stop trembling, objects fall from my hands. If I put jars of yoghurt in the fridge, they slip and crash on to the kitchen floor. Yoghurt I can deal with, but one day I wanted to move a little statue of the Gemini twins, which I'd placed on a shelf like an altar, by a few inches, and I dropped it, too. It shattered. I stood there for at least an hour, looking at these pieces of terracotta which had been the secret symbol of my love, between my feet on the parquet floor, and I thought: there you go, you couldn't say it more eloquently, everything was broken, nothing could be repaired, it was all over. My internment at Sainte-Anne psychiatric hospital lasted for four months. The medical report, which I have in front of me, begins with this summary: 'Characteristic depressive episode with melancholic elements and suicidal ideas in the context of a type 2 bipolar disorder.' And, a little further on, here's how the patient is described on admission: 'Moderate psychomotor retardation with hypomimia, sad expression but emotional reactivity. Despondency, anhedonia, abulia, significant moral suffering, asthenia with a considerable psychic and physical toll incurred in carrying out daily activities. Melancholic elements with pejoration of the future and a sense of incurability. Ruminations, feelings of guilt towards loved ones, invasive suicidal ideations ... ' You don't have to master psychiatric vocabulary to understand that I wasn't doing well. If you want to go into the nuances, 'significant moral suffering' is worrying, but less so than 'intense moral suffering', which I was soon to experience, and which is itself less worrying than 'intolerable moral suffering'. I've experienced that too, I don't know if there's a fourth. In the past few days, my already not very glorious state has worsened. From one day to the next, from one hour to the next, I had gone from agitated to catatonic, and this state so alarmed my sister Nathalie that she made an appointment for me at Sainte-Anne. That's how we ended up on the top floor of a modern building on the edge of the hospital compound, in front of a cordial, 60-year-old man in a white coat, with bright blue eyes and the quiet authority that characterises what's known as a bigwig - even though no one ever talks of anyone being a little wig - who, seeing me in the state described in the report, decides to admit me straight off. I don't go home, they put me to bed, we'll have to wait and see for how long. He stresses the notion of illness - very different from that of neurosis, which has dominated my adult life. The question is not to discover its origin or to understand why I've spent my life lugging such a big load of shit around in my head. The fact is that I'm sick, just as sick as if I'd had a stroke or peritonitis, so they're going to lay me down and look for the right treatment, and they don't hide the fact that they're groping in the dark and that they might not find just the right thing for me right away. 'But what we can do until we find it,' says the bigwig, 'is keep you out of harm's way. And don't worry, we'll get you out of here as fast as we can.' Hearing this, I heave a sigh of relief: I'm sick, I'm going to lie down, stop fighting, let things take their course, they'll take care of me, and for starters they'll shoot me up big time. To return to the medical report: 'Inclusion in a protocol with twice-weekly administration of ketamine. First three infusions: good tolerance, thymic improvement.' Ketamine, for those who don't know, is a horse anaesthetic that people use to get high, and which in recent years has been found to have antidepressant properties. This is my introduction to high psychiatric chemistry. Before and after each session, the protocol includes my being given a questionnaire about about my desire to live or to die, my suicidal impulses, my 'pejoration of the future', etc. First infusion: 40 minutes, not one more or less, and when it's over, it's over, from one moment to the next. But during these 40 minutes it's an XXL high. Lying in bed, I remain conscious, perfectly conscious. I can feel time passing. I can hear the doctor and the nurse talking softly. But I get the impression that they're far, far below me, lost in the landscape above which I'm floating. Because I am floating. I'm drifting. I see everything. I'm perfectly calm, perfectly fine, I'd like it to last for ever. It's like the descriptions of near-death experiences, and of heroin, of course. The heroin that you should never touch because it's so good. I'm glad I'm interned at Sainte-Anne if they're going to drug me so wonderfully. I feel good. After the first three infusions I still feel good - my tolerance to the drug is so encouraging and my thymic improvement so obvious that I'm already talking about leaving, and not just about leaving the hospital, but about leaving the country. With ketamine, work is back on the agenda. 'Fourth injection: bad tolerance with intense moral suffering and request for euthanasia.' Things take a turn for the worse, we're into the rough.  The night before the infusion, I freak out. Although I've forgotten so much, I remember very well that my anxiety had its starting point in one of the most perfidious aspects of bipolar disorder. When you're in the depressive phase, there's no getting around the fact that you're there: it's horrible, it's hell, but at least you can't be wrong about it. What's insidious about the manic phase is that you don't realise it's a manic phase. Especially when it's only hypomanic and you're not stripping off in the street or buying a Ferrari. You tell yourself that you're fine, that everything's all right. After all, that can happen: it's normal, desirable even. You know it won't last for ever, but when it happens you have every reason to be happy and not to tell yourself that it's a trap. In my case, however, there's a good chance that it is a trap, another blow that the disease has in store for me. Because it's no longer me but the disease that wields power over me. In the morning, all I want is the ketamine shot that will send me to heaven for at least half an hour. I want it so much that, fearing I won't be given it if I confess to my psychological state, I say in the questionnaire that I didn't sleep well and that I had some dark thoughts but that in fact I'm fine. The drip begins. I welcome with gratitude the blissful liquefaction, and then very quickly things take a turn for the worse. I'm heading for death. It's clear: I'm heading for death. The doctors murmur softly to the right of my bed, I don't understand what they're saying but they must be reciting verses from the Tibetan Book of the Dead to accompany me to the Bardo. There's a light above me. I have to go there. I have to go there. I mustn't miss the exit. I mustn't remain in this in-between state, this bad life. Everything must end and the suffering must stop, for good. Several times I go to the enormous effort - when you're on ketamine, every word costs you dearly - of repeating 'I want to die, I want to die.' Instead of two doctors there are now four or five in my room, which becomes too small, much too small, a small box that shrinks even more, and, stuck to the ceiling, I start to cry. I cry, I cry, I say that I want to die, that I know very well that it's not their job to kill me, but I beg them to do it anyway. Finally, in response to my moans and my begging that they kill me, or failing that, that they at least turn off my mind, that's what they do, and quickly. One shot, the fuses blow, everyone's gone. Then begins a blank that lasts several days and would end this chapter if I didn't have one more sentence to add. What I'm saying here is brutal, but my condition was brutal and I'd like it to be clear that the doctors I dealt with at Sainte-Anne were and are all very competent, but hey, there are jerks everywhere, and as things turned out, there was one who called Nathalie after this episode and asked: 'Your brother has made a request for euthanasia, what do we do?' The psychiatrist who treats me has seen a lot of melancholic depressives in his time. He knows how to assess the risk of suicide, which he considered to be very high in my case, and I myself realise on rereading these pages that I can find no words to adequately convey the 'intolerable moral suffering' mentioned in my medical report. If I can find no words, it's because I'm too distant and detached today to be able to remember, describe or name the horror in which I was then immersed, and above all, I think, because there are no words for it. What I'm saying here sounds horrible, but in fact it was much more horrible than that. It was an unspeakable, indescribable, unqualifiable and - the word hardly exists, but no matter - immemorable horror. When you're no longer there, you can no longer remember that - thank goodness. Would I have made it through without ECT (electroconvulsive therapy)? How would I have fared? I don't know, and I'll never know. But yes, maybe the ECT did save my life. But whatever the case, the improvement wasn't spectacular. All during the treatment, my hospital report speaks of 'non-linear development with moments of thymic improvement, without a clear recovery of vitality', 'significant thymic decline with anxiety and negative thoughts' and 'increasing memory problems'. In my experience, these memory lapses are the major - and most serious - side-effect of ECT. You're told that they're temporary, that your memory will come back, that at most the loss will only last as long as the treatment period, but it's not true. I'm writing these words three years after the fact, and my memory is still a field of ruins. It often happens to me that I talk to a friend without remembering what we said the day before, or even that we spoke the day before. I'm constantly afraid that the people I love will think I'm either neglectful or inattentive, or that I have the beginnings of Alzheimer's - which wouldn't be unlikely, because the risk of Alzheimer's is much higher than average among people with bipolar disorder. There is, however, a silver lining to all this, because if memory loss is the collateral damage of electroshocks, they also had a totally unexpected collateral benefit. One day, in the cafeteria of Sainte-Anne where he'd come to join me for a hot chocolate, I complained about these memory problems to my friend Olivier Rubinstein. He said: 'You should memorise poetry, that'll take the rust off your neurons.' And in this horribly difficult time, it made my life more bearable. I'm discharged from Sainte-Anne at the end of April, and the report ends with this observation: 'Good transient recovery but frequent relapses.' The fact is that for at least three months I've been doing better, much better even. The medication seems to be working. Lithium is an alkali metal, an element in the periodic table, and, when administered as lithium salt, has proved surprisingly effective in treating mood disorders since the 1970s. I take it every day now, and when I take it I think of the melancholy reflection by the American poet Robert Lowell, who suffered from manic depressive psychosis in its most acute form until he started taking it: 'It's terrible to think that all I've suffered, and all the suffering I've caused, might have arisen from the lack of a little salt in my brain, and that if the effects of that salt had been known earlier, if I'd been given it earlier, I might have had a happy or at least a normal life, instead of this long nightmare.' I wouldn't say anything so radical, because even though I sometimes think it was, my life hasn't been one long nightmare. Still, I too belong to the group of bipolar patients who respond well to lithium. It makes my highs less high, my lows less low, and I'm so afraid to find myself once again back at the Sainte-Anne psychiatric hospital that I'm ready to take it, obediently, for the rest of my life.

Tesla and Mercedes-Benz are the only firms out of 12 big manufacturers who are on course to shift to zero-emissions vehicles at a rate in line with climate goals, according to the campaign group InfluenceMap. Carmakers around the world are racing to introduce new cars with zero exhaust emissions of carbon, and almost every big brand plans to move to battery electric technology. However, at the same time manufacturers are trying to keep selling their highly profitable diesel and petrol cars. The carmakers that plan the slowest adoption of zero-emissions technology are the three biggest Japanese producers - Toyota, Honda and Nissan - while other laggards included South Korea's Hyundai and General Motors in the US. The analysis, based on forecasts to 2029 produced by the data company IHS Markit, included 12 of the world's largest carmakers, although it did not include the largest Chinese manufacturers. The shift to zero-emissions vehicles is seen as crucial for the world's transition away from polluting fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency, a watchdog respected by industry and campaigners, has calculated that 57.5% of global car sales must be zero-emission vehicles by 2030 (equivalent to 52% by 2029) if global heating is to be limited to only 1.5C. Should the world go beyond that target, agreed at the 2015 Paris climate conference, the scientific consensus is that increasing proportions of the globe will become unliveable. Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Elon Musk, produces 100% zero-emission vehicles, while Germany's Mercedes-Benz is on track to produce 56% battery cars by 2029. By contrast, Toyota and Honda are on track to produce only 14% and 18% zero-emissions cars by 2029, according to IHS Markit, as they bet on extended fossil fuel sales. Ben Youriev, a programme manager at InfluenceMap, said: 'A rapid scale-up of battery electric vehicles is critical to meeting global climate change goals. Almost all automakers are failing to keep pace with the transition to zero emissions.' There is still a chance that some of the carmakers could decide to accelerate their transitions to electric vehicles. Regulatory changes in several markets, including the UK and EU, and the rapidly falling cost of producing zero-emissions vehicles will give manufacturers a greater incentive to shift away from petrol and diesel. The US carmaker Ford, which last year said it would go all-electric in Europe by 2030, on Tuesday called for petrol and diesel car sales to be banned in the EU by 2035, in a joint letter with Sweden's Volvo and other leading companies including Tesco, Uber and Unilever. A VW spokesperson said the company agrees '100% that the rapid shift to e-mobility is essential to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees', and said it plans an overall share of battery electric vehicles of 'around 50%' by 2030. BMW said it plans at least half of all sales being all-electric by 2030. Stellantis said 100% of its car and van sales in Europe and 50% of its car and light truck sales in the US will be battery-powered by 2030. A Nissan spokesman said the company had committed to aligning with a 1.5C scenario and that its science-based targets for below 2C alignment had been validated independently. A Honda spokesman said it 'will continue to accelerate towards both electrification and carbon neutrality goals'.  The other carmakers below the 1.5C threshold were also approached for comment.", "4c414d3132d6a2e9f784d390f02b6f50adaa396a97adddc9c9a5f367": "Nearly half of existing fossil fuel production sites need to be shut down early if global heating is to be limited to 1.5C, the internationally agreed goal for avoiding climate catastrophe, according to a new scientific study. The assessment goes beyond the call by the International Energy Agency in 2021 to stop all new fossil fuel development to avoid the worst impacts of global heating, a statement seen as radical at the time. The new research reaches its starker conclusion by not assuming that new technologies will be able to suck huge amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere to compensate for the burning of coal, oil and gas. Experts said relying on such technologies was a risky gamble. The Guardian revealed last week that 195 oil and gas 'carbon bombs' are planned by the industry. This means projects that would each produce at least 1bn tonnes of CO2. Together, these carbon bombs alone would drive global heating beyond the 1.5C limit. But the dozen biggest oil companies are on track to spend $103m (PS81m) a day until 2030 on climate-busting schemes. Greg Muttitt, at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, was one of the leaders of the new research and said: 'Halting new extraction projects is a necessary step, but still not enough to stay within our rapidly dwindling carbon budget. Some existing fossil fuel licences and production will need to be revoked and phased out early. Governments need to start tackling head-on how to do this in a fair and equitable way, which will require overcoming opposition from fossil fuel interests.' Kelly Trout, at Oil Change International, the other lead author of the work, said: 'Our study reinforces that building new fossil fuel infrastructure is not a viable response to Russia's war on Ukraine. The world has already tapped too much oil and gas.' The researchers said governments should accelerate the introduction of renewable energy and efficiency measures instead. The new study, published in the journal Environment Research Letters, analysed a database of more than 25,000 oil and gas fields and developed a new dataset of coal mines. The researchers found that fields and mines that have already been developed would lead to 936bn tonnes of CO2 when fully exploited and burned. That is 25 years of global emissions at today's rate - the world's scientists agree emissions must fall by half by 2030. The researchers calculated that 40% of developed fossil fuels must stay in the ground to have a 50-50 chance of global temperature rise stopping at 1.5C. Half the emissions would come from coal, a third from oil and a fifth from gas. The researchers found that almost 90% of developed reserves are located in just 20 countries, led by China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US, followed by Iran, India, Indonesia, Australia and Canada. The research only considered projects where companies had made final investment decisions, that means committed to spending billions on building rigs and pipelines to extract the fossil fuels. A 2021 study, led by Daniel Welsby at University College London, assessed all known reserves and found 90% of coal and 60% of oil and gas must remain unexploited. Welsby said: 'The new study is a valuable contribution to our understanding of what fossil fuels are highly likely to be produced and the volume which needs to remain in the ground if global warming is to be limited.' But he noted the study did not fully account for methane, a potent greenhouse gas, or the oil and gas used for petrochemicals. The study did not estimate how much CO2 could be removed from the atmosphere by technology in future. 'These technologies are unproven at scale,' said Muttitt. 'There's a lot of talk about them, but we believe it would be a mistake to predicate achieving climate goals on these being delivered at a very large scale. We just don't know whether it will be possible in terms of financing or governance.' Maeve O'Connor, at the Carbon Tracker thinktank, the author of a new report, said: 'Oil and gas companies are gambling on emissions [reducing] technologies that pose a huge risk to both investors and the climate. Most of these technologies are still at an early stage of development, with few large projects working at anything like the scale required by company goals, while solutions that involve tree planting require huge areas of land.' Research published in 2019 found that the world already had more fossil fuel power stations than needed and that some may need to be retired early. The new analysis found fossil fuel production sites also need to be closed, but how to do that is yet to be determined. 'This is an absolutely key question,' said Muttitt. 'One of the biggest barriers will be the legal infrastructure that oil and gas companies and some coal companies have constructed to defend their investments and their profitability, through treaties like the energy charter treaty [ECT].' The ECT allows companies to sue governments over lost profits. There is some discussion, he said, that European Union nations could withdraw from the treaty en masse. A small number of governments, including Denmark, Costa Rica, France, Ireland and California, have committed to stop issuing new fossil fuel licences. If more join, that could be a gamechanger, said Muttitt. Dan Jorgensen, the Danish climate and energy minister, said: 'The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance provides a way for governments to act together to begin a managed phase-out of oil and gas production to avoid dangerous levels of climate change.'", "c504000583db9fd86f7c74e2bcbd0a8e0fe4c5bedcff188c4c565aa7": "North Korea is ramping up production of drugs and medical supplies including sterilisers and thermometers as well as encouraging the use of traditional Korean medicines said to reduce fever and pain as it battles an unprecedented coronavirus outbreak. Traditional medicines were 'effective in prevention and cure of the malicious disease,' state-run news agency KCNA said, although no medical evidence exists for those claims. A Covid wave that North Korea first confirmed last week has fanned concerns over the country's lack of medical resources and vaccines, with the UN human rights agency warning of 'devastating' consequences for its 25 million people. At least 262,270 more people reported fever symptoms, and one more person had died as of Wednesday evening, KCNA said, citing data from the state emergency epidemic prevention headquarters. It did not specify how many people had tested positive for the virus. North Korea, which has imposed a nationwide lockdown, has so far reported 1,978,230 people with fever symptoms and 63 deaths, and brought in strict anti-virus measures. Kee Park, a global health specialist at Harvard medical school who has worked on health care projects in North Korea, said the number of new cases should start to slow as a result of strengthened preventive measures such as travel restrictions and keeping workers separated in groups according to their jobs. But, Park said, North Korea will struggle to provide treatment for the already large number of people with Covid-19, adding that deaths could reach the tens of thousands given the size of its caseload. Factories were churning out more syringes, medicines, thermometers and other medical supplies 'in a lightning way' in the capital, Pyongyang, and nearby regions, KCNA said, while more isolation wards were installed and disinfection work intensified. 'Thousands of tonnes of salt were urgently transported to Pyongyang city to produce antiseptic solution,' KCNA said. The reports came after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un criticised ineffective distribution of drugs and slammed officials for their 'immature' responses to the epidemic. In the absence of a national vaccination campaign and Covid treatments, state media have encouraged patients to use painkillers and antibiotics, as well as unverified home remedies, such as gargling salt water, or drinking lonicera japonica tea or willow leaf tea. 'Traditional treatments are the best!' one woman told state broadcasters as her husband described having their children gargle with salted water every morning and night. An elderly Pyongyang resident said she had been helped by ginger tea and ventilating her room. 'I was first scared by Covid, but after following the doctors' advice and getting the proper treatments, it turned out not to be a big deal,' she said in a televised interview. State media have also encouraged patients to use painkillers and fever reducers such as ibuprofen, and amoxicillin and other antibiotics - which do not fight viruses but are sometimes prescribed for secondary bacterial infections. While it hasn't claimed that antibiotics and home remedies will eliminate Covid, North Korea has a long history of developing scientifically unproven treatments, including an injection made from ginseng grown in rare earth elements it claimed could cure everything from Aids to impotence. Some have roots in traditional medicines, while others have been developed to offset a lack of modern drugs or as exports. The North has so far ignored offers by South Korea and the US to provide medical assistance, as have requests by the World Health Organization (WHO) for more data about the outbreak. Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said this week that WHO was 'deeply concerned at the risk of further spread' in North Korea, noting that the country had worrying numbers of people with underlying conditions that make them more likely to get severe Covid-19 symptoms. In China, Shanghai distributed millions of boxes of traditional Chinese medicine, such as herbal products and flu capsules, to treat Covid as the city battled its largest outbreak of the virus. Three aircraft from North Korea's Air Koryo arrived in China and returned to Pyongyang on Monday carrying medical supplies, a diplomatic source said on condition of anonymity.", "7f01beab622523b1f9914d4382dd24f170378df84a012cfd5911a701": "Massachusetts officials on Wednesday reported a rare case of monkeypox in a man who recently traveled to Canada, and health officials are looking into whether it is connected to small outbreaks in Europe. Monkeypox is typically limited to Africa, and rare cases in the US and elsewhere are usually linked to travel there. A small number of confirmed or suspected cases have been reported this month in the United Kingdom, Portugal and Spain. Health officials in the US said they are in contact with officials in the UK and Canada as part of the investigation. But 'at this point in time, we don't have any information that links the Massachusetts case to cases in the UK,' said Jennifer McQuiston of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though it's the only US case the CDC is aware of, 'I do think we are preparing for the possibility of more cases,' she said. The US case poses no risk to the public, and the Massachusetts resident is hospitalized but in good condition, officials said. The man traveled to Canada at the end of April to meet friends and returned in early May, McQuiston said. A CDC statement said he used private transportation. The case is the first in the US this year. Last year, Texas and Maryland each reported a case in people who traveled to Nigeria. Monkeypox typically begins with a flu-like illness and swelling of the lymph nodes, followed by a rash on the face and body. In Africa, people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals, and it does not usually spread easily among people. However, investigators in Europe say most of the cases have been in gay or bisexual men, and officials are looking into the possibility that some infections were spread through close contact during sex. Monkeypox comes from the same family of viruses as smallpox.  It is usually mild, although there are two main strains: the Congo strain, which is more severe - with up to 10% mortality - and the West African strain, which has a fatality rate of more like 1% of cases.  The Associated Press and Reuters contributed reporting ", "958ab08db1ab72112f50cb7325809598271aad4be264e987949e0cc0": "The White House is braced for a North Korean missile or nuclear test while Joe Biden is on a trip to South Korea and Japan, which begins on Thursday. The national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told reporters on Wednesday: 'Our intelligence does reflect the genuine possibility that there will be either a further missile test, including long-range missile test, or a nuclear test, or frankly both in the days leading into, on or after the president's trip to the region. 'We are preparing for all contingencies, including the possibility that such a provocation would occur while we are in Korea or in Japan,' Sullivan added. Biden's trip is intended in part to signal that he has not forgotten about US strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific despite the focus since February on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 'The message we're trying to send on this trip is a message of an affirmative vision of what the world can look like, if the democracies and open societies of the world stand together to shape the rules of the road, to define the security architecture of the region to reinforce strong, powerful historic alliances,' Sullivan said. Biden is due to leave for South Korea on Thursday for talks with the country's new president, Yoon Suk-yeol. According to the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, he will not be visiting the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas. The president is then expected to travel to Japan on Sunday for a summit of the Quad, comprising US, Japan, Australia and India. US and South Korean intelligence have been briefing for some days that it is possible North Korea could conduct a nuclear test, which would be its first in five years. In March, the Pyongyang regime carried out its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in four years, and has performed three other missile tests since then. CNN cited unnamed officials on Wednesday as saying new missile launch preparations had been observed at a launch site under satellite surveillance near Pyongyang. Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia nonproliferation programme at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies, said there had been general indications of impending nuclear or missile tests, including activity at North Korea's nuclear test site. He pointed out Kim Jong-un recently talked about the need to 'simultaneously push ahead with the material and technological preparations to cope with the future threats and challenges in an all-round way'. 'This might mean either a nuclear or a missile test,' Lewis said, but added: 'I suspect that North Korea's schedule has more to do with their own political concerns and technical factors than Biden's trip.'", "1614e249de3a29a51426b5b83f1c1afcd5591084281a736aa758f24d": "Happy, by species, is an Asian elephant. But can she also be considered a person? That question was before New York's highest court on Wednesday in a closely watched case over whether a basic human right can be extended to an animal. The advocates at the Nonhuman Rights Project say yes: Happy is an autonomous, cognitively complex elephant worthy of the right reserved in law for 'a person'. The Bronx Zoo, where Happy resides, says no: through an attorney, the zoo argues Happy is neither illegally imprisoned nor a person, but a well-cared-for elephant 'respected as the magnificent creature she is.' Happy has lived at the Bronx Zoo for 45 years. The state court of appeals heard arguments over whether she should be released through a habeas corpus proceeding, which is a way for people to challenge illegal confinement. The Nonhuman Rights Project wants her moved from a 'one-acre prison' at the zoo to a more spacious sanctuary. 'She has an interest in exercising her choices and deciding who she wants to be with, and where to go, and what to do, and what to eat,' project attorney Monica Miller told the Associated Press ahead of the oral arguments. 'And the zoo is prohibiting her from making any of those choices herself.' The group said that in 2005, Happy became the first elephant to pass a self-awareness indicator test, repeatedly touching a white 'X' on her forehead as she looked into a large mirror. The zoo and its supporters warn that a win for advocates at the Nonhuman Rights Project could open the door to more legal actions on behalf of animals, including pets and other species in zoos. 'If there's going to be an entire rewrite and a granting to animals of rights that they never had before, shouldn't that be done by the legislature?' Kenneth Manning, an attorney for zoo operator Wildlife Conservation Society, asked the judges. Happy was born in the wild in Asia in the early 1970s, captured and brought as a one-year-old to the US, where she was eventually named for one of the characters from Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. She arrived at the Bronx Zoo in 1977. Happy now lives in an enclosure adjacent to the zoo's other elephant, Patty. The zoo's attorney argued in court filings that Happy can swim, forage and engage in other behavior natural for elephants. 'The blatant exploitation of Happy the elephant by NRP to advance their coordinated agenda shows no concern for the individual animal and reveals the fact they are willing to sacrifice Happy's health and psychological wellbeing to set precedent,' the zoo said in a prepared statement. NRP's attorneys say no matter how Happy is being treated at the zoo, her right to 'bodily liberty' is being violated. They argue that if the court recognises Happy's right to that liberty under habeas corpus, she will be a 'person' for that purpose. And then she must be released. Judges peppered attorneys for both side with pointed questions during oral arguments. Judge Jenny Rivera asked Miller about the implications of NRP's position on human-animal relationships. 'So does that mean that I couldn't keep a dog?' Rivera asked. 'I mean, dogs can memorise words.' Miller said right now there's more evidence showing elephants are extraordinarily cognitively complex with advanced analytical abilities. Lower courts have ruled against the NRP. And the group has failed to prevail in similar cases, including those involving a chimpanzee in upstate New York named Tommy. But last October, at the urging of a different animal rights group, a federal judge ruled that Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar's infamous 'cocaine hippos' could be recognised as people or 'interested persons' with legal rights in the US. The decision had no real ramifications for the hippos themselves, given that they reside in Colombia.", "f4f3d55095a0d1391f6d18d2148392d5d59aee3ee9c453507463f85f": "New York's attorney general, Letitia James, on Wednesday said her office was investigating social media companies the Buffalo grocery store gunman used to plan, promote and stream the massacre that left 10 dead. James said in a tweet her office will investigate Twitch, 4chan, 8chan and Discord along with other platforms the shooter used to amplify the attack. 'This terror attack again revealed the depths and dangers of these platforms that spread and promote hate without consequence,' she wrote. 'We are doing everything in our power to stop this dangerous behavior now and ensure it never happens again.' The FBI said 18-year-old Payton Gendron, who is white, committed an act of 'racially motivated violent extremism' when he opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle on 14 May at a grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood of Buffalo, shooting 13 people. Gendron, who surrendered to police after the attack, released a 180-page manifesto rife with pseudo-scientific racism, antisemitic conspiracy theories and a call for others to mimic his violence. The document is largely copied and pasted from other extremists and from the far-right 4chan. He also used the social media platform Twitch - a live video service owned by Amazon - to broadcast the attack in real time. Gendron has been jailed without bail on a charge of first-degree murder. He pleaded not guilty. In a referral letter on Wednesday, Governor Kathy Hochul requested that James 'investigate the specific online platforms that were used to broadcast and amplify the acts and intentions' of the suspect, the New York Times reported. Hochul on Sunday said the stream should have been taken down faster. Hochul also on Wednesday said she hoped to strengthen the state's red flag law by issuing an order for state police to seek emergency orders to stop individuals from possessing weapons if it is believed that they are a threat to themselves or others, the New York Times reported. Red flag laws allow courts and local law enforcement officials to remove guns from people deemed a risk to communities. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks hate and extremist groups, told Reuters that the Buffalo gunman 'had a substantial online history in niche, toxic online communities'.

'The only option we have right now if this was to be overturned, is to provide the limited resources and support, but it will be limited, especially initially. As a direct result our people are going to suffer,' Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, told the Guardian. Her remarks followed a leaked supreme court draft opinion authored by Justice Samuel Alito that showed the country's highest court ready to overturn Roe v Wade, the nearly 50-year-old ruling protecting the right to an abortion until a fetus is viable outside the womb. Should that decision become official, 13 states with trigger laws would immediately in effect outlaw abortions. Many other Republican-controlled states are expected to follow suit. A 2016 National Institute of Justice study found that more than one in three Indigenous and Alaska Native women had experienced violence in the past year, including sexual violence and violence by an intimate partner. They were 1.7 times more likely than white women to be the victims of violence. They are also at an especially high risk for being trafficked, although comprehensive data is limited. The high rates of these crimes - many of which are never reported, probably due to a mistrust in law enforcement - compounded with not being able to access legal abortions, can leave Indigenous people at an increased risk, explained Echo-Hawk. For those in an abusive relationship, not having access to an abortion could force the victim to stay in a bad situation and lead to more violence, she said. Those being trafficked, some of whom are not allowed to use birth control, may face additional violence from their perpetrators should they become pregnant. Indigenous and Alaska Native women along with Black women are also two to three times more likely to die as a result of their pregnancy than white women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Echo-Hawk said having to access unsafe abortions or experiencing the mental anguish of being forced to go through a pregnancy could increase these numbers. 'That mental health and the mental violence which we're experiencing, that has a direct impact on a person's body when they are going through pregnancy, and it can directly result in pre-term birth and maternal mortality as a direct result,' she said. 'So, we're actually battling mental violence that continues to be perpetuated against us.' For decades Indigenous people were subjected to forced sterilization in the US, with the practice peaking in the mid-20th century. Repealing Roe v Wade would shift the scales of their reproductive autonomy - or lack thereof - to a new and dire extreme, explained Kerri Colfer, senior Native affairs adviser for the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center. 'Native people are still dealing with the trauma of colonization, historic violence against Native people, forced sterilizations, Indian child removal and boarding schools ... being forced to carry pregnancy is a really traumatic thing, whether that is a pregnancy that resulted from assault or not. And now we'll have another generation with that trauma to carry on,' she said. The Indian Health Service provides health care to about 2.6 million Indigenous and Alaska Natives. But the agency, which is within the US Department of Health and Human Services, restricts abortions to those in which a mother's life is at risk or in cases of rape or incest that have been reported within 60 days. Echo-Hawk, who was an author of an amicus brief submitted to the supreme court on this issue last year, said as part of that effort, her organization looked at 33 IHS-funded facilities. They found that between 2002 and 2021, only seven Indigenous women were documented as visiting an IHS facility for an abortion. Instead, some Indigenous people seek abortions outside these facilities, she explained. Repealing Roe v Wade would mean that Indigenous people, some of whom live in extremely rural and poverty-stricken areas, might have to travel much further, to facilities outside their state. She asked: 'How are we going to afford that travel?' Since 2014, Indigenous Women Rising, an Indigenous-led and -centered reproductive justice organization, has helped hundreds through its abortion fund by contributing funding for the procedure, as well as for gas, hotels and childcare. Rachael Lorenzo, its executive director, said if Roe v Wade is overturned, they will need to keep close track of the abortion policies in the states they serve the most, including North Dakota, South Dakota, Arizona and Oklahoma, and willprobably need more funds. The organization has several fundraising events scheduled, including a barbecue cookout for rural communities in southern New Mexico and a two-stepping fundraiser. 'People are scared, and they're angry, and they're frustrated. And so am I,' said Lorenzo, a descendant of Mescalero Apache, Laguna Pueblo and Xicana. 'But we also deserve joy. And if there's any way we can merge the two, by taking action and not letting ourselves get consumed with how scary this is ... that's really where our energy is going to be.'", "4689c9ff77f678565b32331c6589874d190a8ca324bc74f2388bbecd": "The Australian Electoral Commission concedes a large number of Australians - possibly in excess of 100,000 people - who tested positive for Covid early this week and will be isolating on Saturday may not be able to vote in the federal election. Some Covid-positive voters have found themselves caught in a voting eligibility anomaly whereby they missed the deadline to register for postal voting but recorded a positive RAT test too early to access telephone voting. People who tested positive for the virus from Sunday to Tuesday 6pm, but failed to register to postal vote by the Wednesday 6pm deadline, could miss out on casting a ballot. Some voters who tested positive on Tuesday had just 24 hours to register for postal voting while dealing with their diagnosis. The Human Rights Law Centre says the anomaly 'risks disenfranchising tens of thousands of Australians'. In anticipation of Australia's first federal election during the pandemic, a special Covid provision was written into the Electoral Act allowing anyone who tested positive after 6pm on Tuesday 17 May to vote via telephone - a method previously only used by voters with vision disabilities.  That means for people who tested positive from Sunday to Tuesday evening, postal voting was the only option, unless they pre-polled before entering isolation. But applications for postal voting closed at 6pm on Wednesday, so those who did not register before the deadline cannot vote by post. The Guardian has also been contacted by affected voters who claimed they tried to register for postal voting before the deadline but were told their ballot papers would not arrive in time and they should wait until phone voting details became clear on Wednesday - only to ultimately be told they could not vote that way. The exact number of people affected is not clear. The AEC has acknowledged that some in the cohort 'may not be able to vote'. A spokesperson said there was no scope to change the voting eligibility rules because they were set out in legislation. 'We cannot change this,' they said. Even those who applied for a postal vote before the registration deadline are not guaranteed to receive their ballots before Saturday. The AEC spokesperson said 'we will be doing everything we can to ensure people who applied for a postal vote will receive them' on time. On Thursday, the Human Rights Law Centre called on the AEC 'to interpret the provisions in a way that upholds the voting rights of all Australians'. The centre's executive director, Hugh de Kretser, said 'the right to vote is the most fundamental part of our democracy' and was 'enshrined in the constitution and has been upheld by the high court on many occasions'. 'We are alarmed that the AEC is adopting an interpretive approach that seems to be contrary to the intent of the Electoral Act. The AEC's position risks disenfranchising tens of thousands of Australians unless it is revised. We urge the AEC to clarify its position immediately,' De Kretser said. Monique Ryan, the teal independent candidate in the Melbourne seat of Kooyong where the contest with Josh Frydenberg is expected to come down to the wire, called on the AEC to provide a way for those affected by the anomaly to vote. She said the issue 'is not hard to fix'. 'It's safe to assume that a great many people who were in their sick beds with Covid didn't know about the postal vote deadline,' Ryan tweeted. 'I'm going to guess that young people, people who speak a different language at home etc are VERY unlikely to have known about this.' Kooyong voter Guy Miller tested positive for Covid on Monday and realised on Thursday he had missed the chance to register for a postal vote. When his wife, Carol Miller, called the AEC a representative offered to take Guy off the list so he would avoid a fine for not voting, she said. 'I said that's not the problem, he needs to be able to vote somehow.' Carol Miller claimed the AEC representative then suggested Guy take another RAT test and because it would show positive after the phone voting eligibility came in he would be able to vote by that method. 'The AEC is back in the dark ages,' she said. Guy Miller added via telephone: 'It's really slack. This is the first time ever that people have a real chance to make a change. Normally it's a forgone conclusion in Kooying ... I'd hate to be the one vote that could have swayed the election.'", "388ed831330f070862ad6af647bd9eb626518dbc9f3e0ca086462fe0": "More than 42 million adults in the UK will be overweight or obese by 2040 and at higher risk of 13 types of cancer, an 'alarming' report reveals, as health leaders accused ministers of 'kicking the can down the road' when it comes to tackling the obesity crisis. Data collected by Cancer Research UK (CRUK) shows that 71% of people will be overweight by 2040, a rise from 64% today. Of these, almost 36% of adults - 21 million people - will be obese. The charity described the figures as 'staggering'. 'These projections should serve as a wake-up call to the government about the state of our nation's health,' said Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of CRUK. 'Ministers mustn't keep kicking the can down the road when it comes to tackling the obesity crisis - delaying measures that will lead to healthier food options.' Last week, the government announced it was delaying measures to tackle unhealthy eating for 12 months. The former Conservative party leader William Hague said the weakening of the anti-obesity strategy was 'morally reprehensible'. The U-turn will mean a ban on buy-one-get-one-free deals for foods high in fat, salt and sugar will be postponed for 12 months. A ban on TV junk food adverts before a 9pm watershed has also been put on hold for a year. 'I urge them to revisit this decision and take bold action on obesity, the second biggest preventable risk factor for cancer in the UK,' said Mitchell. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of at least 13 different types of cancer and also causes other conditions such as high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. In the UK, an estimated 22,800 cases of cancer are attributed to obesity every year. The CRUK report suggests the number of people who are obese could overtake the number who are a healthy weight as early as the late 2020s in England and late 2030s in Northern Ireland. For Scotland and Wales, the crossover is not expected to happen before 2040. Prevalence of severe obesity (a body mass index above 40) is expected to almost double across the UK from 3% to 6%. About 60% of women are currently overweight or obese but this is projected to rise to 67% by 2040. Among men, 74% will be overweight or obese by 2040, up from 68% now. The report also suggests those experiencing higher levels of deprivation could suffer the most. In 2019, 35% of people living in the most deprived areas of England were obese. This is predicted to increase to 46% by 2040. In comparison, 22% of people living in the least deprived areas were obese in 2019, with a predicted rise to 25% by 2040. Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health and patient information at CRUK, said: 'Obesity is a complex issue and the world around us can make it very difficult to keep a healthy weight. 'Government action is key in making sure that the healthy option is readily available and affordable for people and addressing the wider barriers that prevent people from living healthy lives. If these staggering trends continue, obesity will eclipse smoking as the biggest cause of cancer.'", "6d57ed05e5be250c3d83f855f2cd057c2bdc94104921ee854066ada1": "The wild ride on the US stock markets continued on Wednesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 1,100 points as investors worried about a looming recession. All of the major US markets fell sharply, with the S&P closing down 4%, its largest fall since June 2020, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq losing 4.7%. On Tuesday markets had rallied following positive news about consumer spending and signs that China was relaxing its strict Covid-19 lockdowns. Just a day later concerns about an economic slowdown triggered a wide-ranging sell-off. The sell-off began after Target said supply chain costs and inflationary pressures had cut into its profits and customers were buying fewer higher-margin items such as kitchen appliances, televisions and furniture. The retailer's announcement came a day after Walmart said its profit had also been hit by higher costs. The latest news from Target led to a sell-off for retailers including Amazon, BestBuy, Costco and Dollar General. Investors are increasingly concerned that rising inflation, and the Federal Reserve's plans to tackle it by sharply hiking interest rates, will trigger a recession. Target's management expects inflation to add $1bn to its fuel and freight costs this year and sees little sign of those costs easing throughout 2022. Gas prices topped $4 a gallon in every state this week for the first time. 'Throughout the quarter, we faced unexpectedly high costs, driven by a number of factors, resulting in profitability that came in well below our expectations, and well below where we expect to operate over time,' said Target's chief executive, Brian Cornell. The sell-off was broad-based. Tech companies including Apple, Meta and Tesla fell sharply, as did the makers of household goods and grocery stores including Kroger and Procter & Gamble. General Motors and American Airlines fell along with banks including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. Stocks have been struggling to pull out of a slump over the last six weeks as concerns pile up for investors. Trading has been choppy on a daily basis and any data on retailers and consumers is being closely monitored by investors as they try to determine the impact from inflation and whether it will prompt a slowdown in spending. A bigger than expected hit to spending could signal more sluggish economic growth ahead. The Fed is trying to temper the impact from the highest inflation in four decades by raising interest rates. On Tuesday, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, told a Wall Street Journal conference that the US central bank will 'have to consider moving more aggressively' if inflation fails to ease after earlier rate hikes. Investors are also concerned about global growth as Russia's invasion of Ukraine puts even more pressure on prices for oil and food while lockdowns in China to stem Covid-19 cases worsens supply chain problems. The United Nations is significantly lowering its forecast for global economic growth this year from 4% to 3.1%. The downgrade is broad-based, which includes the world's largest economies such as the US, China and the EU.

Ten metres away, cars howl past on a busy road, drivers unaware of the sacred ritual taking place in the centre of a bustling South African city. Francisco Mackenzie, a chief of the Cochoqua community of the Khoi people, talks of ancient beliefs and battles five centuries ago, against invaders from overseas. He points to the iconic skyline of Table Mountain, and then to a nearby building site. 'This is where we come to venerate our ancestors and the great spirit creator and to renew our nation's ties. That is where the first battle of resistance took place. But money is always disrespectful of nature, traditions and culture,' he told the Guardian. The money in question are the potential profits to be made from a 15-hectare (37-acre) site in Cape Town's Observatory neighbourhood that is being turned into a complex that will house homes, shops, a hotel, conference centre and businesses. By far the most important tenant at the PS200m project will be Amazon, which hopes to base its expanding operations in Africa there. For now cranes and bulldozers are still. Earlier this month, a court in Cape Town upheld a judgment in March which stopped work on the sprawling complex until further consultations had taken place with heritage groups representing some Indigenous communities. 'It is another vindication,' said Tauriq Jenkins, an activist and member of the Goringhaicona Khoena council, as he watched the ceremony begin. 'It will [help] dispel the lies and disinformation that have been generated against our claims. It's a victory for the San and Khoi, our heritage and environment and for restorative justice.' But the story of the development is less clear than it might look, pitting different visions of South Africa's future against one another and causing a bitter row within the communities of the Khoi and the San peoples, who were the earliest inhabitants of the country. Those opposed to the project say the site is a place of worship for both the San, who roamed as hunter-gatherers for tens of thousands of years, and the Khoi, who joined them as pastoralists more than 2,000 years ago. Both were forced off the land by invading Dutch with huge numbers dying of starvation, disease or enslaved. Campaigners say the construction site is at the confluence of two sacred rivers and on land seized by the Dutch East India Company, a powerful trading company run by wealthy merchants in the Netherlands and often seen as the first modern multinational, in 1657. They make the obvious comparison to the present day. 'Back then they was the largest corporate entity on the planet, and they came and took this land ... History is repeating itself,' Jenkins said. Others, however, including several established Khoi and San community organisations, do not see rapacious corporate raiders but a chance to attract much-needed foreign investment to South Africa and to focus attention on the grievances of a historically marginalised minority in the country. A coalition of Indigenous groups calling itself the Western Cape First Nations Collective has backed the project and engaged with the developers who have promised to include a 'world class' heritage centre in the development, staffed and run by educators from the Khoi and San, which will celebrate their culture. Zenzele Khoisan, the chairman of the collective, said the project offered 'hope and future' to marginalised communities and dismissed critics as 'johnny-come-latelies'. 'The confluence of the rivers and the battlefield are not where the development is being built. We have got something now that the South African government has never given us ... This will be the launchpad for new and more intense battles,' Khoisan said. He dismissed the claim that it would destroy important sites as 'poppycock'. South Africa's flagging economy has been battered by Covid, corruption, power shortages and the failure of the ruling African National Congress to push through reforms. Unemployment reached a record 35.3% last year, and almost two-thirds of young people lack jobs. Local authorities backed the development, arguing that it would regenerate a swath of Cape Town. The site area was previously home to a golf driving range and bar, built over an infill site for industrial and railway refuse, next to the confluence of the two now heavily polluted, canalised rivers. James Tannenberger, a spokesperson for the developers, said the recent court judgment would deprive the broader community around the site of 'significant socio-economic and environmental benefits' such as subsidised housing, upgrades to roads, parks and gardens as well as up to 19,000 jobs. Land, its history and its ownership are fraught issues in South Africa, where memories of forced removals and segregation remain fresh nearly three decades after the end of apartheid. Ciraj Rassool, a history professor at the University of Western Cape, said South Africa's existing protection of sites was flawed as it framed heritage as something to be opposed to development. 'The current legislation can't really deal with an argument about history. There is a bias towards architecture and artefacts but here you have the meaning of a landscape,' Rassool said. Judge Patricia Goliath said her ruling should not be understood as a criticism of the development but that the core issue was there needed to be proper consultation before it could go ahead. Amazon representatives in the UK and the US declined to comment. The company already employs thousands of people in data hubs in Cape Town. Jenkins and other campaigners are acutely aware that any victory could be temporary. 'We've stopped this thing for now, but only for now,' he said.", "37225bf4a915dc71a43b7e494ae8c829b821a9548d9c55baf9a39d55": "In the aftermath of the racist shooting that killed 10 on Saturday in Buffalo, the director of the New York State Council of Churches, the Rev Peter Cook, has been a constant presence at prayer gatherings and public memorials. The organization he leads represents eight denominations to New York state government; and he has the ear of political leaders, including Governor Kathy Hochul, in shaping the political response to a massacre that targeted the Black community of East Buffalo - one that has been met with expressions of faith alongside anger and distress. Cook's message is that it's the responsibility of white Christian denominations to challenge white America's relationship with God and guns that is intertwined with white supremacy. According to online postings, the alleged shooter, Payton Gendron, wanted to fashion America as a white-dominated, Christian nation. Such extreme conservative views developed over time from President Nixon's 'southern strategy' to increase political support among white voters in the south by appealing to racism against Black people, tough-on-crime policies and anti-abortion sentiments. According to Cook, guns became ensnared in the strategy. 'It really gave tacit cultural permission to people of faith to own guns, so they conveniently worked their way into this religious freedom argument and conflated it with Christianity itself,' Cook said on Wednesday. 'It doesn't have any theological integrity to it at all, but we use the language of faith to acquire power and to further white supremacist notions.' Drawing attention to the marriage between faith and guns comes with political risk, as the then Democratic party presidential hopeful Barack Obama found in 2008 when, in an unscripted moment, he took aim at white working-class voters in old industrial towns decimated by job losses. 'They get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations,' Obama said in remarks that his rivals pounced on. How to detach gun ownership from being a marker of Christian faithfulness, and the accompanying politicization, concerns Cook. Without knowing Gendron's faith background, he said the accused shooter 'really stepped into that political slew of white nationalists, another derivation of the southern strategy, advanced also in ... looking to preserve the sense of a white, Christian nation and of the original founders being white, Christian men, being representative of what America is'. Some Black churches, Cook said, have had to accommodate the language of things like 'tough on crime', and the increase in mass incarceration under Bill Clinton, in order to maintain their own political influence and power.  East Buffalo has suffered from discriminatory lending practices, poor health outcomes, high rates of maternal death, lesser investment in schools, food deserts and highways driven through Black neighborhoods to connect white people from one place to another. In the Buffalo massacre's aftermath, most denominations have come out with strong statements against violence and are advocating for federal legislation to require a universal gun background check, prohibit purchasing firearms at gun shows and ban semi-automatic weapons. In New York, they are pushing for legislation to stop guns from being imported from states with laxer gun laws. 'I think for the church, with a number of exceptions because gun culture infuses Christianity, we need the strongest gun laws we can think of,' Cooks says. 'We don't think much of the second amendment.' Attempts to forge stronger relationships between churches and gun control advocates have proceeded slowly. Two years ago, Everytown for Gun Safety began an interfaith effort with more than a dozen religious leaders to boost election turnout in support of candidates who support anti-gun violence measures. The group's partners include representatives from Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu and Sikh backgrounds. 'Churches, especially white evangelical churches, have largely ignored this question - I think, much to their own detriment and to the detriment of the people they're called to serve,' said the Rev Rob Schenck at the time. Schenck, a former evangelical anti-abortion activist who shifted to support abortion rights, described gun violence as a 'life-or-death issue', making it essential to include gun control in 'pro-life' agendas. Others who have taken up that call include the Rev Traci Blackmon, who became prominent after police fatally shot Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. Blackmon is expected in Buffalo this weekend as the funerals of the Tops Friendly Market shooting victims begin. Cook said he was appalled when a church in his region held a fundraising raffle for an AK-47. The effort to detach guns from faith within church leadership and congregations may need an assertive voice which links pastoral care to larger structural questions while being resilient to inevitable political pushback. Cook alluded to Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German Lutheran pastor and theologian who opposed the Nazis. 'It's going to come from a lot of conversation and teaching within the church and really getting people within the faith to act on their faith and really weigh in on these policy questions,' Cook said. 'That's a really hard thing to do, but I think if there were more people within our congregations who paid attention to this stuff and really put the pressure on Congress and their legislators to pass tough gun laws that could be really important.' But Cook concedes that could be tough. 'It starts with straight-up, honest conversations within our churches and getting people to get out of their pews, get out here, and show up at rallies, be present and listen to people, listen to their pain,' Cook said. 'A lot of times churches can be a little insular. 'We're debating what color we should have for the carpet and what kind of coffee we're going to serve at coffee hour. We'll preach about loving thy neighbor and non-violence, but how that really translates to people's personal and collective lives is complicated.'", "cdc227f432e8557ed4e66ac69dfd5f5d57795f62619f678f8d844267": "", "cb6083999059f35453210905f1022836a9407c1ce9dfd86bc5089dff": "The novelty cheque has long been a mainstay of the political 'photo op' but a Guardian Australia analysis of photos posted during the 2022 and 2019 election campaigns suggests giant cheques are on the way out, while hi-vis workwear and photos of dogs are on the rise. During our work building the automated systems behind the pork-o-meter, which tracks election campaign pork barrelling as it occurs, the Guardian's data team found ourselves asking an important question. Could we teach a robot to spot photos of novelty cheques? We were already using machine learning to flag text from politicians' Facebook posts as likely grant announcements and election promises, but having another model in place to find big cheques and certificates in photos might pick up things we'd missed in the text. Giant cheques have made news in previous years - in 2019 when the former Liberal candidate for Mayo, Georgina Downer, presented a grant to a bowling club despite this practice usually being the domain of the sitting MP. A novelty cheque again made headlines in 2020, when Senator Pauline Hanson announced a $23m grant for Rockhampton stadium. With this in mind, we trained an object recognition model to spot giant cheques. And from there it was a short step further to look at other common tropes of election campaign photo ops: hi-vis workwear and hardhats, cute dogs, and footballs. We chose these as they were either already available in pre-trained models such as Coco, or had publicly available image datasets for model training. Then we collated every photo posted by a major party candidate, MP or senator to Facebook in the 2022 and 2019 election periods using the Facebook API, and ran our object detection models on these images. So what did we find? First, some important caveats about our method. While many of the images do constitute pictures from photo ops, many photos are also just things politicians shared on their pages. For the prime ministerial candidates, the Facebook photo dataset also doesn't include every photo op they've done on the campaign trail - we were able to cross-check this thanks to AAP's comprehensive election coverage. So the dataset is not necessarily all the photos the politicians want to go on the news, but definitely the ones they want to share with voters on social media. We also first checked each image for the presence of a person before running the object detection. This excludes photos that only had a dog, for example. Our method also can't tell if the politician is the one wearing the hi-vis, so if a politician shares a photo of someone else in workwear, it will be counted. These detection methods also don't have 100% accuracy, so it's best to treat the following numbers as a minimum count. Here's the total number of all photos featuring each thing, along with the proportion of all photos in that campaign year: It suggests that politicians are leaning even more heavily into the hi-vis photo opportunity, and leveraging the broad appeal of the cute dog. Novelty cheques however are relatively scarce in this campaign period, and footballs and other sports balls are down on 2019. Now let's look only at the photos posted by the leaders of the major parties - the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese. For this one, we checked against their actual Facebook feed for any photos our models had missed. Both leaders have had a few campaign moments with dogs, so there's no surprises there. But Morrison has a higher hi-vis count than Albanese, despite Labor being more usually associated with blue-collar workers. It's possible that Albanese's missed days on the campaign trail due to Covid-19 account for this. However, could it be that Albanese's makeover and relative lower hi-vis count - new suits, glasses and so on - is part of a strategy to make the Labor leader more appealing to business leaders? And could it be the reverse for Morrison - is the party of business making a visual appeal to voters outside their traditional base? This is only speculation, but it's something to consider. These types of photo opportunities are an inexpensive way to get voters' attention and communicate a politician's position on an issue, according to Luke Mansilo, a PhD candidate in political science at the University of Sydney. ''Dog licks politician' is a very low-cost way of getting attention, as opposed to paying for advertisements,' he said. 'And going to a factory that makes you wear a hi-vis vest does make a really quick, visual short cue for someone who's not always necessarily paying attention to the news to think, 'This party is representing the interests of people like me'.' Finally, here are the top 10 politicians ranked by the number of hi-vis and hardhat photos posted during this election campaign: In the lead is the Liberal candidate for Paterson, Brooke Vitnell, who has posted photos from a number of factory visits in the New South Wales electorate where she's campaigning. Facebook photos for all Labor and Coalition MPs, candidates and senators were scraped for the 2019 and 2022 campaign periods. In 2022 this includes photos posted up to 10 May for everyone except party leaders, who we have updated to 18 May. A number of assumptions have been made in comparing 2019 and 2022, such as that people haven't deleted photos and generally share photos in the same way in both years. For the object detection machine learning process we used the ImageAI Python library, which is based on TensorFlow. For each of the categories of hi-vis workwear, hardhats and novelty cheques we trained a custom YOLOv3 object detection model. Hi-vis was based on a publicly available dataset of 800 photos, while hardhat detection was based on a publicly available dataset of 1,500 photos. We collated and labelled 310 images of giant cheques to train the cheque-detection model. Dogs, sports balls and people were detected using a RetinaNet model pre-trained on the Coco dataset. Detection thresholds for the key photo op objects were set deliberately low to increase the chance of finding most objects, with false-positives removed by visually inspecting the output.", "33f28dd88a9bed1e2ef3bc6c3828c7c887b7971b671d0055c9463b07": "", "ac156f3794279803f2be47ce485b5730857b1f5934f060856b6f6ef1": "Amazon has invested more than PS1bn on TV, movie and live sport content in the UK in recent years and plans to increase spending to make it a must-have streaming service for cash-strapped households. It is the first time that Amazon has revealed the level of investment in Prime Video in the UK, spanning the period since 2018, as competition for viewers intensifies amid a mounting cost of living crisis. While Amazon's annual UK budget lags that of the $1bn (PS810m) spent by Netflix on hits from Bridgerton to Sex Education, it continues to rapidly grow - with big releases in the pipeline such as the Lord of the Rings series - while its rival is in the process of cutting budgets and staff after reporting its first fall in subscribers in a decade. 'Our investments are ramping year over year, said Chris Bird, managing director of Prime Video UK, ahead of the unveiling of a major slate of new programming at an event in central London on Thursday. 'Over the last five years we have crossed the PS1bn mark, that feels like a milestone to recognise our growth here. We are fully committed to our future in the UK, as we are across Europe and the world.' Amazon has doubled down on its commitment to the UK signing a record-breaking long lease deal for its first permanent studio space in the UK at Shepperton Studios, where Netflix also has a deal, and making the surprise decision to move shooting of the mega-budget Lord of the Rings TV series from New Zealand to the UK. New Zealand's minister for economic development and tourism, Stuart Nash, said that the first series in the saga, called The Rings of Power, which will premiere later this year, cost about NZ$650m (PS332m) to make. Bird acknowledged that the streaming market is not immune to the cost of living crisis, but maintained that Prime Video has achieved the status of a 'must have' service alongside Netflix. 'We are expecting a challenging time [for households] ahead,' he said. 'Inflation is rising, the cost of living is soaring and we don't expect the same level of video engagement from customers as we had seen through the pandemic period. But that is not dampening investment at all. We are not expecting a dramatic slowdown. We are still seeing growth in our business and customers are pleased and excited.' At the end of the first quarter Netflix had 222m global subscribers, Prime Video 152m and Disney+ 138m. In the UK, Netflix remains the market leader with an estimated 14m subscribers, followed by Prime Video on 11.9m and Disney+ at 4.8m, according to Ampere Analysis. 'We expect customers will be more savvy in their purchase choices,' he said. 'It's been about multiple subscriptions in the past, but with the challenges of the cost of living perhaps that reduces.' As well as its own subscription video-on-demand service Amazon has an advertising-funded free service called Freevee, which was rebranded from IMDB TV last month, and 100,000 titles to buy or rent as well as offering subscriptions to partner video channels such as reality TV streamer Hayu. Netflix has said that it is to launch an ad-funded subscription tier later this year to attempt to reignite growth. 'We are a different service,' said Bird, who worked at British streaming site LoveFilm, which was bought by Amazon in a PS200m deal in 2011 to spur its ambitions to take on Netflix in the UK. 'Our catalogue, whilst perhaps smaller in volume than other services, is very well crafted and specific in our goal to be seen as high quality.' While US streamers including Amazon, Netflix and Disney continue to inject an increasing amount of money into British-made shows and films, the biggest spenders in the UK remain traditional national broadcasters. The BBC's total annual content budget across TV, radio and online is about PS2.3bn, with spend on TV content about PS1.6bn of this. ITV spends about PS1.1bn annually on content for its portfolio of channels, while Channel 4's PS700m budget is about the same as Netflix. Last year, a record PS5.6bn was spent making blockbusters such as Mission: Impossible 7 and big-budget dramas including Bridgerton in the UK. It was double the level of investment in 2020, when the spread of coronavirus shut down the production industry for months on end, and almost PS1.3bn more than the previous record set in pre-pandemic 2019.", "7ba730008f62f7076b81a034defe033dbb2e6391cf2151f61f2b362a": "", "92275f15c4c3ca93ceba7bd45090d6ccc337fbdccb99524dd5c2443e": "", "05b25f7a53f753b7556d47a5a7518ebf255ac3c1efd0da3301195a1b": "", "6ceadc13e9605e684ce19cf0eeefa5a9ffde7c72ce2a5e8547244e7a": "New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern says she has lost her sense of taste after testing positive for Covid-19 on Saturday. Thursday was budget day in New Zealand, when traditionally the prime minister has an early morning breakfast with finance minister Grant Robertson. Typically, the two share cheese rolls - a South Island New Zealand delicacy involving cheddar cheese and powdered soup rolled inside a piece of toasted white bread. This year, the breakfast took place via Instagram live stream - and the prime minister said the cheese rolls were missing their usual flavour notes. 'They're going to taste just as good - but do you know what - I'm not going to know, because I've lost all my [sense of] taste,' Ardern said. The finance minister encouraged her to focus on texture rather than flavour. 'Enjoy your cheese roll, think about the texture rather than the taste on this occasion,' Robertson said. Ardern remains in isolation and was absent in person from New Zealand's budget announcement, the most important day of the political year. Speaking via video link to parliament, Ardern said: 'My virtual presence in the debating chamber is obviously not to my preference on such a significant day.' This year's budget included a $1bn set of temporary measures, including cash payments, reductions to petrol taxes and half-price public transport to ease the cost-of-living crisis. 'No temporary fast relief can be perfect, but it can make a difference,' Ardern said. The big-ticket spending from Thursday's budget included $11.1bn for healthcare reform and funding to address the climate crisis. When she announced she had contracted Covid-19, the prime minister said she was 'gutted' to miss the day. 'There are so many important things happening for the government this week ...

She lived in a spacious cage filled with rocks, soil, logs and a ready supply of fresh invertebrate food in the island's national park. She wasn't particularly active, but then again it's impossible to know what goes on in the mind of a skink. Her namesake was Forrest Gump - they were both solitary individuals who, despite being mild and unassuming, experienced momentous events while remaining quite unaware of the exceptional courses their lives had taken. The Christmas island forest skink (or whiptail skink) used to thrive on its island home, an Australian territory off the coast of Indonesia. In 1979, researchers documented that they were its most abundant skink. These lizards were, visually, fairly nondescript. Not too small, but by no means large, they averaged about 20cm (8in) in length, with a slim body covered in brown-yellow scales. They were practically the default image that comes to mind when you think 'lizard'. As recently as 1998, you could see dozens upon dozens of their little tan bodies among the leaf litter of the forest floor, basking in the slivers of sunlight poking through the dense forest canopy, munching on the insects they found. What is perhaps most frustrating to those who fondly remember Gump and the other forest skinks is that they can't say for sure what caused their rapid downfall. The forest skinks are an ancient group of species, evolving more than 5m years ago. They lived on Christmas Island for tens, if not hundreds of thousands of years. And yet they declined from abundance to extinction in mere decades. By 2003, they could only be found in select, niche locations on the island, which measures just 135 sq km (52 sq miles). It was probably a confluence of factors. About a quarter to a third of the island was cleared in the 20th century for phosphate mining, disrupting the island's ecology in ways that are still not fully understood. Another problem was all the non-native species that were introduced to the island. Insects such as crazy ants competed with the skinks for food. Wolf snakes, feral cats and giant centipedes all preyed on the reptiles. Forest skinks, which had lived with very few natural predators on their isolated island for so long, could not withstand these pressures from all sides. By 2008, researchers could only find the forest skink at one site. The skinks' decline was happening so quickly that biologists felt a kind of whiplash. They still knew so little about these reptiles, and yet they were already vanishing. Amid a sense of great urgency, in 2009 they sought to capture as many forest skinks as they could for a breeding program. But it was too late. There were too few of the highly evasive, shy creatures. In the end, they caught just three, all female, including Gump. The trio lived in a cage for a couple of years, until two of them, in an unfortunate mishap, escaped from their cage and died. Just Gump remained. Conservation scientists hoped that they would find a male for Gump to mate with to keep the species alive. But though they scoured the rugged terrain of Christmas Island, examining limestone boulders and combing through the forest, no forest skink had been seen in the wilderness since 2010, at the end of those initial capture efforts. Gump lived for another few lonely, quiet years. Looking at Gump and her solitary existence 'gives you a really odd feeling', says John Woinarski, a conservation biologist at Australia's Charles Darwin University who lived on Christmas Island for two years to study endangered species such as the skinks. 'You're looking at that last individual, knowing that when the individual will die, as it inevitably would, that it would be the end of that long evolutionary history ... It's a scar on our conscience.' Gump succumbed in May 2014, just four months after Australian legislation finally listed the Christmas Island forest skink as endangered. The International Union for Conservation of Nature declared the species officially extinct in 2017. Even if they hadn't dwindled so quickly, Gump and her kindred forest skinks would have been conservation underdogs. Big, coordinated conservation efforts tend to rally around charismatic species first. 'It's a human bias and we shouldn't be showing it - all of these species have a right to exist,' Woinarski says. The forest skink disappeared soundlessly - its extinction as quiet as its day-to-day life.", "b61933aa8465e80f0b814a1dff5f4c7ec14425bc3cd35e1a4d1ac522": "", "ea48efc229f08a72b4a57aecd48765a1bec6f5c887e0e7b02961f458": "", "4ae2e8152c4510f3074e8aace9a8ebb4e87d48a7a3219fd48a783d6a": "Republican candidates who questioned, denied and challenged the results of the 2020 presidential election won a string of consequential primaries in Pennsylvania and North Carolina this week, a testament to the enduring power of Donald Trump's voter fraud myth, which continues to animate the hard-right movement he started. In a campaign season dominated by angst over the economy and frustration with leadership in Washington, several hard-right candidates successfully channeled conservative grassroots momentum, and are now in striking distance of positions that will have enormous influence over voting and elections administration in battleground states across the country. Democrats, meanwhile, who face a grim electoral outlook dampened by Joe Biden's dismal approval ratings, chose to elevate candidates who more closely reflected the party's base, with progressives on the verge of growing their ranks in Congress. Though not yet complete, the results from Tuesday's highly anticipated election night delivered a composite portrait of a Republican party still in Trump's thrall, even in races where his chosen candidate came up short. In Pennsylvania, Republicans nominated Doug Mastriano, a hard-right election denier who was a key figure in the efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in his state. He attended and helped organize Trump's 'Save America' rally in Washington on January 6 that preceded the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol, and has been subpoenaed by the House panel investigating the assault. Mastriano's victory sets up a high-stakes showdown with Josh Shapiro, the state's Democratic attorney general. Should Mastriano prevail in November, he would be in charge of one of the most contested states in the country - one in which the governor appoints the secretary of state, who in turn oversees the election. During his campaign, Mastriano embraced elements of Christian nationalism, staking out controversial positions on issues such as abortion, LGBTQ rights and public health mandates. In one debate, he suggested he would oppose any exceptions to an abortion ban, including in cases involving rape or incest. Shapiro has cast himself as a defender of abortion rights, an issue that is expected to play a key role in governor's races this fall should the supreme court strike down Roe v Wade, as is anticipated. In his victory speech Tuesday night, Mastriano lashed out at media outlets and commentators who referred to him as 'extreme'. 'They like to call people who stand on the constitution far-right and extreme,' he said. 'Forcing your kids to mask up, that's extreme. Forcing healthcare workers to lose their job for not getting a jab. It's extreme when you shut down businesses in our state.' In the marquee Senate race, the Trump-backed celebrity physician, Mehmet Oz, was neck-and-neck with the former hedge fund chief executive David McCormick, with nearly all of the vote tallied. The conservative commentator Kathy Barnette had fallen far behind and was out of contention for the nomination. During the campaign, the candidates competed to claim the Maga mantle. Both Oz, who touted Trump's endorsement, and McCormick, who is married to the former Trump administration official Dina Powell, struggled to animate the former president's loyal base, and spent millions of dollars of their personal war chests attacking each other in one of the most expensive intra-party brawls of the cycle. That apparently left an opening for Barnette, who enjoyed a last-minute surge in the polls. Despite her Maga bona fides and endorsements from Trump's allies, the former president warned voters that she was unelectable. In response to doubts about the strength of her candidacy, Barnette said: 'Maga does not belong to President Trump.' In North Carolina, the scandal-plagued first-term congressman Madison Cawthorn lost his re-election bid despite Trump urging supporters to give the 26-year-old Maga firebrand a 'second chance'. He was beaten by Chuck Edwards, a state senator who offered a record that was every bit as conservative but without the celebrity. It was a sharp fall for Cawthorn, once viewed as a rising star in the Maga universe, and a rare win for the Republican party's old guard, which aligned against him. Trump's choice for Senate, the North Carolina congressman Tedd Budd, also triumphed. Trump's early endorsement of the little-known House Republican reshaped the race, elevating a candidate who objected to the certification of 2020 election results in two states. He beat out the state's former governor, Pat McCrory, who refused to say the 2020 election was stolen. Budd now faces the former state supreme court chief justice Cheri Beasley for the seat being vacated by the retiring Republican senator Richard Burr. If elected, Beasley would be the southern state's first Black senator if elected. Trump's choice in Idaho also came up short, failing to unseat the state's Republican governor, Brad Little. Janice McGeachin, the state's far-right lieutenant governor, who twice attempted a power grab while Little was out of state, had made Trump's false claims of a stolen election a central plank of her candidacy. While much of the focus was on Trump's influence over his party, Tuesday's results tested Biden's appeal among the party's base. In Oregon, a progressive challenger, Jamie McLeod-Skinner, appeared on track to unseat the congressman Kurt Schrader, a seven-term incumbent with a reputation for breaking with his party. Schrader was the first candidate Biden endorsed this cycle, and his loss would be a major victory for the progressive movement. In Pennsylvania, Congressman Conor Lamb, an avowed centrist from the Biden wing of the party who won difficult races in Trump country, lost handily to the state's lieutenant governor, John Fetterman, an iconoclastic progressive with blue-collar appeal. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania state representative Summer Lee, running for an open House seat, appeared to have overcome a wave of money from outside groups aiming to counter the progressive movement. If she wins the primary in the solidly Democratic district, Lee would be on track to become the first Black woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress. 'Our victory shows that we can overcome the billionaire class that wants to divide and conquer us all with fear and lies-for-profit, if only we come together across our differences for a positive vision of multiracial democracy,' Lee wrote on Twitter after declaring victory on Tuesday night. 'We can have nice things, if we fight.'", "3ea8895b7582a3f01b3a4f35e32dd1a45ee68b2c2c99af979e356a51": "Weekly $27 cash payments, fuel discounts and half-price public transport are among the short-term sweeteners offered up by New Zealand's government in its latest budget, as it tries to juggle the cost-of-living crisis with big-ticket spending commitments, including $11.1bn of healthcare system reform and $2.9bn responding to the climate crisis. 'While we know the current storm will pass, it is important we take the hard edges off,' prime minister Jacinda Ardern said in remarks accompanying the budget's release. 'The plan this year is to do two things,' Ardern said. To 'ensure Aotearoa New Zealand's economic and social security for generations to come ... making us less vulnerable to external shocks,' and 'cushion the impact of the inflation cycle on families'. It's the latter that will draw many households' attention. On budget morning, local headlines were dominated not by fiscal policy, but by cheddar cheese and frozen berries - reports on recent supermarket price-spikes topping the most-read. New Zealanders have been feeling the pinch on multiple fronts, with petrol prices passing $3 a litre, food prices up 6.4%, inflation at its highest in three decades, and April rents up 6.9% from 2021. Finance minister Grant Robertson announced more than $1bn for cost of living relief, including a weekly cash payment that will go out to nearly 2.1 million New Zealanders. The $814m relief package will be distributed for three months to those earning less than $70,000, at a rate of $27 per person a week, or about $350 in total. The government will also extend temporary steps it took earlier in the year: cutting 25c a litre fuel excise duty to try to counter petrol price increases, cutting road user charges, and extending the half-price public transport fares announced in April. 'Eighty-one per cent of working age New Zealanders are now being supported through these cost of living pressures as a result of what we've done in this budget,' Grant Robertson said. Asked whether those payments amounted to a 'short term sugar hit', Robertson said they were a targeted approach - as opposed to broad-base tax cuts - which would not contribute to worsening inflation. Those short-term measures represent a concession from the government in a year in which it had hoped to focus on big ticket, far-horizon spending and securing Labour's policy legacy after two tumultuous, pandemic-dominated years. After fighting its Covid fires, the 2022 budget represents a crucial opportunity to invest in the far longer term problems of emissions reduction, and a troubled health system. The overhaul of New Zealand's health system was the other major headline item, with $3.1bn allocated over the next two years. The government had already committed to creating a new, centralised health system and doing away with the 'postcode lottery' of uneven care it said was created by the current, district-based health board system. All in all, the budget outlined more than $13.2bn in health system investments over the next four years, which Robertson said was the largest ever investment in New Zealand's health system. Health minister Andrew Little said $1.8bn would be committed this year to 'clear the financial deck,' paying off past years' health system deficits and launch two massive new national health entities - Health NZ and the Maori Health Authority. The Maori Health Authority, a new body set up to provide by-Maori, for-Maori services and try to address disparities in care, would receive only a tiny portion of overall funding, including $168m for commissioning services. Addressing the climate crisis was the other major spending line, with $2.9bn of climate investments in energy security and decarbonising transport. Those measures are part of a $4.5bn for a climate fund, announced earlier in the week, to try to drive a low-emissions economy and prepare the country for the effects of climate collapse. Spending on social issues spending like child poverty, mental health and homelessness - previously headline items for the Ardern government - took a lower rung. Around a billion dollars spread across an array of measures including clamping down on gangs, changing rules to increase the child support payments accessible by single parents, and funding services for family and sexual violence. $202mn was assigned to invest in the mental health system and addiction treatment. Opposition parties on the right are advocating for tax cuts, and said the budget would contribute to the 'brain drain' by driving young New Zealanders in search of greener pastures. '$350, I don't know if that buys you a plane ticket to Australia these days, but I think that some people when they look at the forecast, and this budget, and they will make that choice,' said National party finance spokesperson Nicola Willis. National leader Christopher Luxon said the $350 payment was 'just a bandaid on a major wound'. The Act party called it the 'brain drain budget'. Leader David Seymour said the government's strategy was to 'tax the productive to fund Labour's ideological fantasies, then just hope they don't leave. Unfortunately, more and more will.' Some advocates and community providers will be disappointed that the social relief spending does not go further to reduce some of the deep-seated wealth and ethnicity inequities in New Zealand. The cost of living measures will be finished within three months, family violence and child poverty spending is minor, and the investment in Maori health services represents only a fraction of the overall health reform package. But Robertson was quick to emphasise that while the immediate demands of the Covid crisis were fading from view, it had only been replaced by new, international crises and pressures - most of which were not New Zealand-specific. 'Budget 2022 is being delivered against the backdrop of a global inflation spike, with existing supply chain pressures being exacerbated by pressure on oil prices from the war in Ukraine. This will pass but we need to protect New Zealanders from the immediate impact.' 'The last few years have been challenging for everyone,' Robertson said. 'Some of those challenges are still with us.'", "f7b3f89d9ebaddd4f0855d8d158b27b5cba9cfad27ef086725ae5cc1": "A rare stone circle has been found at a prehistoric ritual site in Cornwall, with seven regularly spaced pits mapped by a team of archaeologists. Bracken and scrub were cleared over the winter at Castilly Henge near Bodmin to allow archaeologists to survey the site. They found the pits lying in a crooked horseshoe formation. Experts believe the pits may once have formed a complete ring but ground conditions at the time of the survey left archaeologists unable to gather clear data on the northern part of the henge interior. Some stones had been removed and taken elsewhere, while others were probably pushed face down into the pits in which they once stood upright. Castilly Henge is believed to have been built during the late Neolithic period, about 3,000-2,500BC. Defined by an external bank and an internal ditch, the henge formed an amphitheatre-style setting for gatherings and ritual activities. Not all henges contain a stone circle, and there is only one other in Cornwall - Stripple stones on the slopes of Hawk's Tor on Bodmin Moor. Archaeologists believe henge sites would have been used for gatherings and rituals. Research at Castilly Henge began in 2021 when it was included in a scheme by Historic England to conserve and repair monuments on its at-risk register.  Volunteers led by the Cornwall Archaeology Unit cleared the site of vegetation that was threatening features of the site hidden below ground. This enabled teams from Historic England to carry out the first detailed topographic and geophysical surveys of Castilly Henge. Peter Dudley, a senior archaeologist at Cornwall Archaeological Unit, said the management of the 'amazing archaeological site' has been improved with re-fencing. 'Now the monument is looking so much better.' Ann Preston-Jones, a project officer for at-risk heritage sites with Historic England, said: 'The research at Castilly Henge has given us a deeper understanding of the complexity of this site and its importance to Cornish history over thousands of years. It will help us make decisions about the way the monument is managed and presented, so that it can be enjoyed by generations to come.' There is evidence to suggest Castilly Henge was used as a theatre in the middle ages and a gun emplacement during the English civil war.", "1ac9c14be8972ae089f2fb35b8d269ed8dd65f0595baeb71562fdc23": "One of the last five fugitives wanted for his role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, Pheneas Munyarugarama, died in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2002, UN prosecutors have announced. Munyarugarama, a local army commander, 'died of natural causes' and was buried in Kankwala, in the eastern DRC, the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals (MICT) announced in The Hague. The news comes less than a week after the tribunal announced the death of Protais Mpiranya, the top remaining wanted suspect over the deaths of about 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in a 100-day slaughter. 'For the victims and survivors of Munyarugarama's crimes in the Bugesera region, we hope this result brings some closure,' the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Serge Brammertz, said in a statement. A former lieutenant colonel in the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR), Munyarugarama, who was born in 1948, was charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda with eight counts including genocide and crimes against humanity. 'Munyarugarama was alleged to be responsible for mass killings, attacks and sexual violence against Tutsi civilians at various locations in the Bugesera region, including the attacks on Tutsi refugees at the Ntarama and Nyamata Catholic churches,' the MICT said. The tribunal said that after a 'comprehensive and challenging investigation', prosecutors established that Munyarugarama 'died from natural causes on or about 28 February 2002 in Kankwala ... where he was also buried'. The tribunal said only four fugitives now remained on its books: Fulgence Kayishema, Charles Sikubwabo, Charles Ryandikayo and Aloys Ndimbati. Top fugitive and alleged genocide financier Felicien Kabuga was arrested near Paris in 2020. The Libyan and Belgian-trained Munyarugarama fled to the former Zaire shortly after the 1994 genocide where he joined remnants of the Rwandan armed forces, according to a summary of his movements made by the tribunal's prosecutors. In 1998, he helped recruit ex-Rwandan soldiers for the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) rebel group, largely basing himself in the DRC's eastern Kivu provinces as a senior FDLR leader. In late 2001, the Hutu-supremacist movement was to gather in Kinshasa for talks on how to integrate itself into one structure, prosecutors said. Munyarugarama, escorted by two relatives and FDLR escorts, 'made a lengthy journey on foot ... heading for Kinshasa', prosecutors said. 'The journey lasted several months and involved crossing arduous terrain including jungle, swamps and several difficult river crossings.' Munyarugarama 'had difficulty with the river crossings ... and nearly drowned, and afterwards started reporting feeling unwell to his travelling companions,', prosecutors said. Several days after reaching the small village of Kankwala in North Katanga along the way, 'Munyarugarama fell ill' and died in 2002. 'Although the exact cause of death is unknown, due to a lack of trained medical staff and facilities, it was from natural causes,' prosecutors said, adding he was buried there the next day 'in a coffin in an unmarked grave'. Mpiranya, meanwhile, died of tuberculosis in Zimbabwe in 2006, according to prosecutors.

Associate Prof Louisa Gordon, a health economist at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, influenced state, territory and federal governments in Australia to regulate and eventually ban tanning beds from 2016. Research from Gordon and her colleagues found that 281 melanomas, 43 deaths and 2,572 squamous cell carcinomas were attributable to solarium use in Australia each year, at a cost to the health system of around AU$3m. It is estimated that the ban led to 31,009 melanomas being averted in young Australians over their remaining lives. Despite the risks of solariums being now well established, other countries have been slower to ban or regulate them. Frustrated by this lack of progress, Dr Martin Eden from the University of Manchester in England, spent several months in Australia working with Gordon and her colleagues to understand how they assessed the costs and harms associated with solarium use in Australia. They then applied that modelling to England, tracking the projected impact of a solarium ban on the more than 600,000 18-year-olds living there. Their research, which has just been published in the British Journal of Dermatology, found a ban on indoor tanning would result in 1,206 fewer cases of melanoma and 207 fewer melanoma deaths over their lifetimes. It would save the National Health Service PS700,000, the study found. A solarium ban would also result in 3,987 fewer cases of other more common types of skin cancer, squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas, the research found. 'We had all of the evidence, the calculations and strategies that we used while making the model to inform the health and economic case for a ban in Australia,' Gordon said. 'We handed that over to our colleagues in England and said: 'Why don't you adapt this to the UK situation?' 'So we did a lot of the bulk of the early work in Australia, and now they [Eden and his team] have improved that model and updated it to make their case.' The sunbed industry was in its infancy in Australia when the calls for a ban began. But in England, 'the industry is established and profitable, so the challenge there is even greater now than what Australia faced,' Gordon said. In England, sunbed use is especially high in the north-west and in cities with greater social deprivation. Its popularity is thought to partly explain the unusually high rates of melanoma among young women living in the north-west. It is also estimated there are about 62,000 children under 18 currently using sunbeds in England. Sunbeds give off ultraviolet radiation that can damage the skin and eyes and, Gordon said, increases the risk of having a melanoma by almost 60%. Prof Adele Green from the University of Manchester said despite sunbeds leading to deaths, 'policymakers require robust economic evidence to inform decisions about a possible ban of such devices to mitigate these burdens'. 'We feel we have succeeded in providing that evidence.' The chief executive at Melanoma Focus, Susanna Daniels, said the rates of melanoma skin cancer are increasing in the UK, yet 86% of cases are preventable. 'We strongly advise the avoidance of sunbeds,' she said.", "ffdf94cbdc3081fd90733b2ac761a518c2e7ca833536ea066f1131e4": "", "be94310d79944fc6d2bb7f7fbe13467afbdecac0fcea7b649ae7874f": "", "51cb8c6d09a1434135c3f024df46b93cf180279d96d5706e228d004e": "", "0cf24765b33c6d07812c1ea741e4bf016040ca7ed9e124173473764a": "", "e1b123772acdd3d4f5b9d4ff3b529d1fd65d7cce27b2d99e02b78061": "", "70994ab8198e9a79e747a075599de732b79a24b19e2b6c417bdb0529": "", "77ce1013ab7ccff1de5e2ccc2ae57da24f5e663ddaf8b8d26a410d8a": "Tymofiy Seidov is the only child left in his village near the city of Kharkiv, in north east Ukraine. The eight-year-old spends much of his time drawing at a little table, dimly illuminated from above by a tiny LED light, in the corner of the otherwise almost completely dark 40-by-five-metre basement that he shares with 23 others including his mum, aunt and grandmother. Tanks feature a lot in his pictures. But today, in the gloom, he is working on some Dalek-like monsters that he says he remembers from a cartoon he watched on YouTube before the war. He also draws happier scenes, sometimes, of houses under the sun and rainbows in the sky. But the world outside this underground flea market, full of jumble, mattresses, chairs, washing lines, giant jars of pickled vegetables, dusty marked duvets, plastic bags full of clothes and framed icons proudly on display atop overturned boxes, has been out of bounds to him for months. There is a Spiderman figure, a few packs of cards, a Mike the Knight board game and a collection of felt-tip pens and pencils in his corner, but Tymofiy has not seen another child since 30 April, when most of the basement was evacuated. This quiet, polite boy and his family have been living here below the ruins of a two-storey kindergarten and medical centre in the village of Kutuzivka, 12 miles east of Kharkiv, since the war in Ukraine began on 24 February. The fighting around Kutuzivka has been bitter. Closer to Russia than any other large Ukrainian city, Kharkiv was a key target for Vladimir Putin and this territory was the way through. Before the war, the population of Kutuzivka was 1,500-strong. Today it is less than 50. The Russians took the village on 18 March before losing it to Ukrainian forces about two weeks ago. The abandoned protective vests, helmets, wound dressings and half-eaten plates of polenta strewn across what was the Russian headquarters in the village's community centre suggest it was a hasty departure. But if the Russians can leave in a flash after many weeks of occupation, the exhausted and tearful people in Tymofiy's basement know that they could just as quickly return - or at least the artillery can. Much of the damage in their village and to their homes above has been done since the Ukrainian soldiers arrived, which was when the Russians started to batter their positions - and anything else that got in the way. Eight Ukrainain soldiers were killed nearby that very morning. While there appears to be little more to hit apart from crumbling buildings and torn metal, the sound of shelling remains constant - often very loud and close. Speaking as another thud of artillery fire sounds, Tymofiy's mum, Rita, 32, says she never thinks about tomorrow. 'I just think about surviving,' she says. A painter before the war, Rita has not put brush to paper since 24 February. 'I want to forget, to never think of it - I don't have the materials here anyway but I don't want to paint about it,' she says. 'Tymofiy is calm today but during the heavy fighting he would become hysterical.' The basement has four doorless rooms. There is a calendar on display in each of them with the days of the month passed crossed off. It is, they say, important to remember how long they have been down here and to know that it will not last for ever. A small calendar above where Timofiy is working, stuck up on the wall between sketches of two Ukrainian flags, was drawn by a 15-year-old boy after he dreamed that the Ukrainians would liberate the village on 27 April. When that prophecy came true, the boy left with his parents, as did most of the 150 people, including 40 children, who had been living in the basement. But Timofiy and his family had nowhere to go. The basement residents do, however, have each other. Alla Lisnenko, 59, is the cook. With a torch attached to her head with elastic, she is chopping aubergine for tonight's dinner. When everyone came underground on 24 February they brought the contents of their larders, but fresh food has been at a premium. It was a relief when some of the men dug shallow wells to get drinking water, but everyone soon became sick because the acrid smoke from burned-out homes had polluted them. That is where Natalya Leus, 40, a nurse who had worked in the medical centre above, came in. She used what medicines she could to try to keep the children in particular hydrated when they struggled to keep water and food down. Alla's husband, Alexander, is a particular favourite. He had built a wood-burning stove for someone before the war and three weeks after the Russians invaded, he brought it into the freezing basement, and has been regularly feeding it with logs. He also sourced the four LED lights wired to an old truck battery that offer at least some illumination to their underground home. Nadiya Ryzkova, 75, whose house was recently destroyed, provides an ample supply of milk. She sneaks out in the early in the morning to milk the goats herself. 'We drink it every day,' she says, flourishing a large bottle of it. 'We can certainly share,' she laughs. With some western analysts suggesting that the Battle for Kharkiv is all but over, everyone hopes that the arrival of the Ukrainian forces is the beginning of the end. It was Alla, the cook, who spotted the friendly faces first during a dart back to her house for supplies and brought the news to the basement. 'I heard some tanks moving by I saw Ukrainian soldiers', she says. 'I was blowing them kisses but they signalled for me to get down. 'Get down granny',' she laughs. 'I shouted glory Ukraine.' Did they celebrate? 'Not yet,' says Rita. 'We don't know what is coming next'.", "36daa2cd7ff38e2d8e135b9b93ad85197ff249d8de20296e830a9966": "Russia's defence ministry has issued its latest operation briefing.

Schallenberg said that the country, which obtains 80% of its natural gas from Russia, would continue to provide humanitarian support to Ukraine rather than lethal weapons. 'We are helping on a large scale but not with war munition and I think help for Ukraine cannot only be reduced to war munition,' he told the broadcaster.

Russia's ministry of defence has issued a statement on Telegram saying it has been requested by the investigative committee of Russia to provide information on 'the illegal actions of Ukrainian armed formations related to the use of civilian objects for military purposes'. Without providing evidence, it claims 'the Azov Battalion used the buildings of kindergartens and schools to equip barracks' and that members of the 'Aidar' battalion also equip firing positions in places not intended for this, creating a real danger to the civilian population'. The Russian ministry of defence also claims that in the Dnepropetrovsk region, Ukrainian forces set up military operations in hospitals and that 'the staff and patients of medical facilities are being held as human shields'. The statement concludes 'As part of the criminal cases under investigation, the investigative committee will record this information and continue to establish all the circumstances of the incident, as well as the Ukrainian security forces involved in this.' Russia has repeatedly denied making targets of civilians and civilian infrastructure during the latest invasion of Ukraine, which they have termed a 'special military operation'. Asked previously about allegations of war crimes committed by Ukrainian forces, the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko stated last month that 'each and every incident will be investigated.' The office of Ukraine's prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, has said allegations of more than 10,700 crimes by Russian forces have been registered since the war began. Vadim Shysimarin appeared at Kyiv's district court last week accused of murdering a 62-year-old civilian. The UK's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has been doing the media round in the UK today, and on Times Radio she has said that Russian assets seized in Britain could be used to help pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine.

The State Emergency Service of Ukraine have issued their latest daily update saying that yesterday they neutralised 685 explosive devices on Ukrainian soil. They say that the total number of munitions dealt with since Russia's latest invasion began on 24 February has reached 110,593 explosive devices. Thomas Meaney is a fellow at the Max Planck Society in Gottingen, and he writes for us today saying Finland and Sweden may join Nato - but even they can't guarantee that will make them safer: Whether Finland and Sweden will actually be safer in Nato is another question. Their declarations have only drawn a mild rebuke from the Kremlin, which has warned against a military buildup in both countries. Vladimir Putin's regime has never suggested the possibility of hostilities against either country, with which it has consistently enjoyed cordial relations. Memories of past Russian-Finnish military confrontations suggest that anyone thinking about an incursion into Finland should consider medical treatment. One sensitive point in the Finland-Nato question is that Russians make up the largest minority in Finland. Their main representative organisation has made it clear that it can resolve any of its political issues through the procedures of Finnish politics. But some Finnish officials fear Putin could still use Russian grievances inside Finland as a pretext for hostilities.

The fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers who have ended weeks of resistance at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol remains unclear, after the fighters surrendered and were transferred to Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine's deputy defence minister said they would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials said on Tuesday they could be tried and even executed. MPs in Russia's State Duma said they would propose new laws that could derail prisoner exchanges of fighters who Moscow claims are 'terrorists'. Russian investigators have said they plan to interrogate the soldiers and could charge them with 'crimes committed by the Ukrainian regime against the civilian population in south-east Ukraine'. On Tuesday evening, seven buses carrying Ukrainian soldiers left the Azovstal plant in the port city and arrived at a former prison colony in the Russian-controlled town of Olenivka in Donetsk, Reuters reported. Full story here. Here's more on the war crimes trial due to kick off today. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, will appear at Kyiv's Solomyansky district court from 2:00 pm (1100 GMT), charged with war crimes and premeditated murder, over the death of a 62-year-old man in northeastern Ukraine on February 28. The soldier from Irkutsk in Siberia faces a possible life sentence. 'He understands what he is being accused of,' his lawyer Viktor Ovsiannikov told AFP, without revealing the case for the defence. Ukrainian authorities say he is cooperating with investigators and admitting the facts of the incident which came just four days after the Russian invasion began. Prosecutors said Shishimarin was commanding a unit in a tank division when his convoy came under attack. He and four other soldiers stole a car, and as they were travelling near the village of Shupakhivka in the Sumy region, they encountered a 62-year-old man on a bicycle. 'One of the soldiers ordered the accused to kill the civilian so that he would not denounce them,' the prosecutor's office said. Shishimarin then fired a Kalashnikov assault rifle from the window of the vehicle and 'the man died instantly, a few dozen metres from his home', they added in a statement. In early May, Ukrainian authorities announced his arrest without giving details, while publishing a video in which Shishimarin said he had come to fight in Ukraine to 'support his mother financially'. He explained his actions saying: 'I was ordered to shoot, I shot him once. He fell and we continued our journey.' His lawyer said the case was proving challenging. 'This is the first such case in Ukraine with such an indictment. There is no relevant legal practice or verdicts on such cases. We will sort it out,' he said. Ukraine's chief prosecutor Iryna Venediktova underlined the importance of the case for her country in a series of tweets. 'We have over 11,000 ongoing cases of war crimes and already 40 suspects,' she said. 'By this first trial, we are sending a clear signal that every perpetrator, every person who ordered or assisted in the commission of crimes in Ukraine shall not avoid responsibility.' Two Russian servicemen are due to go on trial from Thursday for firing rockets at civilian infrastructure in the northeastern Kharkiv region. Hello and welcome to the Guardian's live coverage of the Ukraine crisis.  The big news today is that the first war crimes trial since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine will begin in Kyiv. It is against a Russian soldier accused of killing an unarmed civilian, a 62-year-old man in northeastern Ukraine, in the days after the invasion began. The trial, expected to be followed by several others, will test the Ukrainian justice system at a time when international institutions are also conducting their own investigations into abuses committed by Russian forces. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, will appear at Kyiv's Solomyansky district court charged with war crimes and premeditated murder, the soldier from Irkutsk in Siberia faces a possible life sentence.

The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, personally accepted the Nordic neighbours' membership applications at the headquarters of the 30-member, US-led defensive military alliance in Haren, in the north-east of Brussels. 'I warmly welcome the requests by Finland and Sweden to join Nato. You are our closest partners,' Stoltenberg said, hailing the occasion as 'a historic step' and 'a good day at a critical time for our safety'. Sweden's ambassador to Nato, Axel Wernhoff, and his Finnish colleague Klaus Korhonen handed over the application letters from the two Nordic countries, signed by their respective foreign ministers, shortly after 8am on Wednesday. The Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, and the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, are due to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet the US president, Joe Biden, for talks on their countries' application and European security more broadly. 'The security interests of all allies have to be taken into account and we are determined to work through all issues and reach rapid conclusions,' Stoltenberg said. 'All allies agree on the importance of Nato enlargement. We all agree that we must stand together and we all agree that this is an historic moment which we must seize.' Nato ambassadors are expected to discuss the applications on Wednesday and could give the green light on opening formal talks with the pair on their requests. However, the accession process requires the unanimous approval of all the alliance's members and Turkey has said it will not support the applications. Nato accession - including ratification by all member states - usually takes between eight and 12 months, but the alliance has said it wants to move quickly given the threat from Russia hanging over the Nordic countries' heads. Canada has said it expects to ratify Finland and Sweden's accession protocol within a few days. Ankara says its objections are based on what is describes as Sweden and Finland's support for members of Kurdish militant groups, and their decisions in 2019 to impose arms export embargos on Ankara over Turkey's military operations in Syria. Helsinki, Stockholm and the other western allies have said they are optimistic they can overcome Turkey's objections. Many analysts believe the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who faces elections next year, is seeking concessions for domestic political advantage and is unlikely ultimately to veto the applications. Andersson and Niinisto told a joint press conference in Stockholm on Tuesday that the Nordic neighbours, which have abandoned decades of military non-alignment since Russia's onslaught on Ukraine, would go through the accession process 'hand in hand'. The Finnish parliament voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to back the Helsinki government's proposal to apply for Nato membership, while Andersson confirmed on Monday after a parliamentary debate in Stockholm that Sweden would do likewise. Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia and has maintained strict policies of neutrality then non-alignment since the end of the second world war, viewing Nato membership as a provocation of Moscow. Sweden has stayed out of military alliances, and has not fought a war, for more than 200 years. However, Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has led to a profound change in both countries' thinking, with public support for Nato accession in Finland trebling to about 75% and surging to between 50% and 60% in Sweden.", "c3d3eb7eed165127a1f0062d23beecfb0f7c7dc9b490e1a76b302a79": "A Russian tank commander has pleaded guilty to shooting dead 62-year-old man as he rode his bicycle down a village road, in Ukraine's first trial for war crimes committed during the Russian invasion. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, sat emotionless as prosecutors detailed charges that he had fired his AK-47 at the unarmed cyclist from the window of a car in the north-eastern Sumy region in late February. Prosecutors have moved fast. It is extremely unusual to hold a trial while a conflict is still ongoing, and unprecedented to do it within weeks. The victim was shot dead less than three months ago, in the first days after the invasion. But Ukraine has made seeking justice for atrocities committed by Russian troops a priority. National prosecutors are risking their own lives to collect evidence of war crimes even in areas still threatened by enemy forces or laced with mines. The case is being heard by three judges, who must reach an unanimous verdict for the suspect to be convicted and sentenced, even after the guilty plea. He faces life in jail for the killing. They will hear testimony from two witnesses. One is the victim's wife, who was in the court to watch Shysimarin acknowledge murdering her husband, and another is the Russian soldier who was in the car with him at the time of the shooting and was later taken prisoner by Ukrainians. They will also be presented with evidence including the alleged murder weapon, in hearings expected to last two days. Shysimarin comes from Ust Illyinsk in the south-east Irkutsk region of Russia and was a commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division on the day of the killing, 28 February, in Chupakhivka village. Prosecutors say a group of Russian soldiers shot at a civilian vehicle after their convoy came under attack from Ukrainian forces, then stole the car and drove it away. They later came across the unarmed victim, who was talking on his phone just a few dozen metres from his own home. One of the men in the car told Shysimarin 'to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders', according to prosecutors. He opened fire out of the car window, and shot down the man. That instruction to open fire could not be considered a military order that might protect him from responsibility, prosecutor Andriy Syniu told journalists outside the courtroom. 'The person who gave an 'order' isn't his commander. He was aware of that. The person who gave the instruction was aware of that. Before they got into the vehicle they didn't know each other,' Syniuk added. Ukrainian prosecutors have the support of several teams of international investigators and forensic experts, but face a mammoth task. Over a thousand bodies have been unearthed from mass graves in the town of Bucha alone, and dozens of rapes have been reported. Ukrainian prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova is preparing over 40 cases for war crimes trials, and authorities say they have registered more than 10,000 war crimes, including attacks on hospitals. Large swathes of Ukrainian territory are still under Russian control, and abuses have been widespread in all areas liberated from its forces to date, so the toll is expected to rise considerably if other areas fall back under Kyiv's control. Human Rights Watch also said on Wednesday that it had documented further 'apparent war crimes' by Russian troops around Kyiv and Chernihiv regions, including 22 apparent summary executions, nine other unlawful killings, six possible enforced disappearances and seven cases of torture. One of the few precedents for holding a trial while a war is still raging comes from the Balkans. A Bosnian Serb soldier, Borislav Herak, was captured by Bosnian army soldiers, put on trial for 35 killings and 14 rapes, and convicted of genocide and crimes against civilians. Senad Kreho, who was president of a district military tribunal in Sarajevo in 1993, said the legal system functioned fairly even though the war was still ongoing. 'Numerous subsequent reviews of [Herak's] case by international and national legal experts found that he was given a fair trial,' Kreho told the Associated Press. Two further unnamed soldiers are expected to have a first hearing in Ukraine within days, facing allegations they used a Soviet truck-mounted 122mm multiple rocket launcher to shell homes and civilian buildings in Kharkiv district. Another case will be heard in absentia shortly. A soldier named as Mikhail Romanov is accused of rape and murder. Russia, which calls the invasion a 'special military operation' denies its soldiers have committed war crimes.

'The impact of poverty, and the impact of lack of opportunity for people, does lead to an increase in crime. There's no two ways about that,' Andy Cooke said as inflation hit a 40-year high of 9%. When asked how policing could avoid being seen as the arm of an uncaring state, he said forces across England and Wales were skilled in dealing with the tensions and dynamics of their communities. 'What they've got to bear in mind is what is the best thing for the community, and that individual, in the way they deal with those issues. And I certainly fully support police officers using their discretion - and they need to use discretion more often.' Cooke said he was not advocating an amnesty for people who commit crimes of poverty, nor 'giving a carte blanche for people to go out shoplifting'. Instead, he advised officers to make sure such matters of law enforcement are 'dealt with in the best way possible'. In a wide-ranging interview, Cooke also said: The chief inspector of constabulary is the head of the independent assessor of police forces in England and Wales. Cooke, a former chief constable of Merseyside police, took over from his predecessor Sir Tom Winsor last month. Past economic slumps have led to a rise in offences such as theft, and Cooke said surging inflation and fuel costs were likely to eat away at police budgets. Speaking on the cost of living crisis, a key issue that will have knock-on effects for policing in the coming months, Cooke said: 'I think whenever you see an increase in the cost of living or whenever you see more people dropping into poverty, I think you'll invariably see a rise in crime. And that's going to be a challenge for policing to deal with.' He believes that rank-and-file officers should be trusted to use their own judgment in some cases. 'It's one of the great things about being a police officer, you're allowed to make your own decisions in relation to all of these issues. It's not a new thing,' he said. But this did not mean an amnesty for certain crimes, he added. 'There's always individual cases where you can use your discretion that doesn't necessarily result in a prosecution but is dealt with in the best way possible. And the shoplifting one's a good example, isn't it?' One chief constable whose area includes pockets of poverty agreed with Cooke. 'There is a difference between a first-time offender who steals bread, cheese or milk to eat, and someone stealing to feed an addiction,' they said. 'Police are there to help people in extreme need, that's why we joined. We can signpost them to a food bank or help like that.' Away from the cost of living, Cooke said the charging rate for recorded offences at 6% was far too low and he expected a dramatic increase. 'I think it's not unrealistic to aim for 20%. That's a realistic expectation in my view.' He would not put a timeframe on reaching that target, but said: 'I think when we have a return of 20,000 police officers and those officers have had an opportunity to be properly trained, with sustained financial support from the government, I think that's a realistic ambition.' As part of boosting confidence in policing, Cooke said every burglary victim should get a visit from police to scour for fingerprints and other forensic evidence. He said this was necessary and achievable'because burglary is an exceptionally invasive crime', often offering 'forensic opportunities'. He said: 'After you've suffered such a crime as burglary, the expectation should be that as a victim you get professional service from policing. So when I was a chief that was my expectation, and that expectation doesn't change now.' He said the inspectorate would consider marking forces down if every burglary victim does not get a visit. 'If I got burgled, I would be absolutely devastated if all I got was a phone call.' Charge rates for rape stand at barely above 1% and Cooke accepted victims were being failed. 'Any charge rate that sits around 2% in relation to such a serious offence must mean there is a failure somewhere.' Policing suffered from years of cuts and is nowunder pressure from the current Conservative government and the public to boost crime fighting. Cooke said forces were still recovering from the cuts but things were beginning to return to a 'better position'. However, it would take 'some years' for the 20,000 extra officers currently being recruitedto become effective, he said. Figures show public confidence in the Metropolitan police, Britain's largest force, is at its lowest on record. Only 49% of Londoners thought local police did a good job, down from 68% in March 2017 when Cressida Dick became commissioner. Cooke said the inspectorate would try to stop forces falling into crisis and was currently inspecting the Met.

The health ministry cautioned that the suspected cases - all in the Madrid region - had yet to be confirmed, but said a nationwide alert had been issued 'to guarantee a swift, coordinated and timely response'. Madrid's regional health department said the suspected cases were being analysed by the National Microbiology Centre to obtain a definitive diagnosis. 'Generally speaking, monkeypox is spread by respiratory transmission, but the characteristics of the 23 suspected cases point towards transmission through mucus during sexual relations,' it said in a statement. 'The people involved are doing well and are isolating at home, but a close eye is being kept on them in case they need hospital treatment.' Fernando Simon, an epidemiologist who heads Spain's health emergencies centre, said while it was unlikely that monkeypox would spread significantly, 'that can't be ruled out'.  Portuguese authorities have confirmed five cases and are investigating another 15 suspected cases. In a statement on Wednesday, Portugal's health ministry said the cases it had detected - all in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley region - had all involved men whose symptoms included ulcerative lesions. 'The UK has reported similar cases of ulcerative lesions, with confirmed monkeypox virus infection,' it said. 'We are monitoring the situation at national level and in conjunction with European institutions.' The first of the seven cases logged in the UK involved a person who had recently been to Nigeria, where they are believed to have contracted the infection. According to the UK Health Security Agency, all four of the most recent cases are men who identify as gay or bisexual or other men who have sex with men. The health body is asking these groups 'to be alert' to possible symptoms, which include rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns. Early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. A rash that can look like chickenpox or syphilis can also develop and spread from the face to other parts of the body, including the genitals. Most people recover within a few weeks. A handful of cases of monkeypox, which has two forms and is typically found in central and western Africa, have been diagnosed in the UK in the past. It is thought the seven UK cases involve the west African strain, which is milder than the more severe central African, or Congo, strain.", "cce4cc67f24c0c20040f69497cda186f3281ad22d7eee084bb98698b": "Boris Johnson's row with the EU over Northern Ireland's Brexit arrangements is 'absolutely solvable' but only if the UK accepts that a border is inevitable, the former head of the World Trade Organization has said. But Pascal Lamy said the prime minister could only achieve a breakthrough if he stopped mixing 'oil and vinegar' and throwing emotional Brexit politics on to what he said was essentially a technical problem. Lamy said he did not understand the UK's strategy, which risked a trade war with the EU, but added that it was unlikely to come to this as the 'cost-benefit ratio' was 'ridiculous'. If matters did deteriorate and the EU retaliated with sanctions, the bloc would win as those with greatest capacity for trade generally did, Lamy said. His comments, in an interview with the Guardian, came after the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, threatened new laws to allow the UK to change some of the Northern Ireland protocol. The UK government has come under pressure from the Democratic Unionist party and the Traditional Unionist Voice, both of whom campaigned on an anti-protocol ticket in the recent Northern Ireland assembly elections. Lamy, who has followed Brexit closely over the past seven years, and who is now president of the Paris Peace Forum, a French non-profit organisation, after leaving the WTO in 2013, said demands to remove the border in the Irish Sea completely would never deliver a breakthrough. 'I don't understand exactly what they [the UK] are after,' he said. 'If it is no border it won't work. You cannot leave the EU and not have a border. That's just having your cake and eating it. 'So there is a question mark as to what exactly is the problem on the UK side. If it is 'we don't want a border' then it is like saying: 'We don't want Brexit.' Then this is unsolvable.' Lamy continued: 'The UK government has this capacity to mix problems and to cook a political soup. 'These are oil and vinegar issues between emotion and technicalities. Emotion is extremely high because Boris Johnson keeps beating the drum to say Brexit is a great thing. He has to increase the sound of the drum to say Brexit is a great thing all the time.' If the UK admitted a border was the direct consequence of Brexit, then a solution could be found, Lamy said. There could be a dynamic solution for Northern Ireland, he suggested. This would involve a 'thin border' with few checks on trade across the Irish Sea while the UK remained aligned to EU standards. This would become a 'thick border' if the UK wanted to diverge from those standards, Lamy added. This solution would require equivalence in standards with the EU and has already been rejected by the UK as unacceptable because it would compromise the country's control of its own laws. Lamy said this went to the core issue of borders between nations and always involve tradeoffs. 'The UK are torn between their political position, which is they want to have the capacity to diverge [on standards], and the technical consequence of that, which is a thicker border,' he said. The only way to solve the issue was to 'dial down the emotion' and 'let the technicians find the solution that allows both sides to find a midway between a thick and a thin border'. Given the border between the UK and the EU was not negotiable, the UK's best shot at a solution was to 'play for time, as you can't play with money', Lamy said. Solutions included trusted trader schemes that would would 'transport the border up the value chain' and light-touch checks at ports. 'Customs officers only have a limited amount of time in the day. It's about finding a compromise between ensuring control on one side and trade to flow on the other,' Lamy said. He played down the UK's threat to legislate to 'disapply' some of the protocol if the EU did not concede to Johnson's demands, saying he found it difficult to believe the UK and the EU would end up in a trade war. 'If there was one, the EU would win as generally the one that has the largest trade capacity prevails,' Lamy said. With war in the Ukraine and Sweden and Finland making the momentous decisions to join Nato, Brexit was an 'irritant' to EU leaders, he added.", "93a6dd3fb7897b0513e919b0a437893338d7c0e6dbb4479610fd3f9d": "It took Mohammed more than three years and a journey of more than 5,000 miles to reach the UK after fleeing a massacre in his village in Sudan. Now, just over a week after arriving by kayak across the Channel, he is among the first tranche of asylum seekers facing forced removal to Rwanda, on the continent where his journey began. A 'notice of intent', sent by the Home Office, warns that Mohammed (not his real name) has 14 days to register reasons why he cannot be relocated under the government's controversial new scheme. He is believed to be the first of about 50 asylum seekers in his position to speak out. The 25-year-old said: 'I wanted to reach the UK because I heard it was a place where I could be safe. We started hearing that the UK government was planning to send people who arrive in small boats to Rwanda but we didn't believe they would do this.' He said the prospect of travelling to Rwanda, after fleeing Sudan via Libya, had triggered flashbacks. 'I thought the UK was a good country with a lot of humanity,' he said. 'I'm shocked that the Home Office is not treating me like a human being. 'I haven't been able to sleep since I arrived here. My trauma is getting worse and I've been having more flashbacks about what happened to me in Sudan and Libya since I arrived in the UK. It was so hard for me to escape from Africa and now the UK government wants to send me back there.' Mohammed said he left Sudan in January 2019 after a brutal attack by Janjaweed militia on his village. 'It was horrific,' he said. 'Many people were killed, girls and women were raped and others were kidnapped. Those like me who survived the massacre escaped as soon as we could.' He travelled from Sudan to Libya and spent a year there, where he said he was exploited by traffickers. Libya is a popular transit country for refugees from places such as Sudan and Eritrea who are trying to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean in small boats to Italy. 'I was controlled by traffickers in Libya. They held us in some overcrowded, underground place and forced us to do farming work,' said Mohammed. 'After a year I managed to escape. Some people were shot when they tried to escape from the traffickers. Since that time in Libya I have developed a lot of breathing difficulties. I also have difficulty sleeping, suffer many flashbacks and suffer from a lot of trauma.' In 2020 he crossed the Mediterranean, passing through Malta and other countries before reaching northern France. He said that during much of his journey through Europe, he had to sleep in the streets. After arriving in Calais, he said he and 10 other refugees from Sudan made repeated attempts to cross the Channel in a kayak designed for four people because they were too poor to pay smugglers for passage in a larger, sturdier dinghy. 'We tried many times to cross but sometimes our boat sank so we had to go back to France,' said Mohammed. 'Life was so hard in Calais, especially in the winter when it was very cold sleeping outside. Eleven of us finally managed to cross the Channel in a kayak. The journey was very difficult and we were lucky to survive because the waves were so high.' They made it to Dover, where Mohammed said they were processed by Home Office officials and tested for Covid. He and four other Sudanese men he travelled with were taken to a detention centre and given a notice of intent about being offshored to Rwanda.  'I was so shocked when I found out the government wants to send me and other refugees to Rwanda after all the years it has taken me to get here. I feel so sad after all that I've been through that I've put in a place like a jail in the UK. It's not right in this world,' he said. The PCS union, which represents Home Office staff, is challenging the department's new offshoring policy along with NGOs Care4Calais, Detention Action and Freedom From Torture. Clare Moseley, the chief executive of Care4Calais, said: 'The one thing that all refugees have in common is that something truly terrible has happened to them. Now they are facing the further trauma of deportation across the globe. Sending them to Rwanda will abuse their rights, cost taxpayers millions and break international law. We are fighting it and we need public support.' A Home Office spokesperson said: 'The world-leading migration partnership with Rwanda means those making dangerous, unnecessary and illegal journeys to the UK may be relocated to Rwanda to have their claims for asylum considered and to rebuild their lives there. The first group of illegal migrants have received notices of intent. Depending on their circumstances, they will have up to 14 days to submit reasons on why they should not be relocated to Rwanda.'", "3d1657c0ae092a7544138a85f8f62e45f4c3c00f91a7fbc3e12e29f8": "Afghan armed forces collapsed last year because they had been made dependent on US support that was abruptly withdrawn in the face of a Taliban offensive, according to a scathing assessment by a US government watchdog. A report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) on the catastrophic defeat that led to the fall of Kabul on 15 August, blamed the administrations of Donald Trump and Joe Biden as well as the Afghan government of Ashraf Ghani. 'Sigar found that the single most important factor in the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces' (ANDSF) collapse in August 2021 was the decision by two US presidents to withdraw US military and contractors from Afghanistan, while Afghan forces remained unable to sustain themselves,' said the congressionally mandated report, which was released on Wednesday. The Sigar account focused on the impact of two critical events that it said doomed the Afghan forces: the February 2020 Doha agreement between the Trump administration and the Taliban, and then Biden's April 2021 decision to pull out all US troops by September, without leaving a residual force. 'Due to the ANDSF's dependency on US military forces, these events destroyed ANDSF morale,' the inspector general said. 'The ANDSF had long relied on the US military's presence to protect against large-scale ANDSF losses, and Afghan troops saw the United States as a means of holding their government accountable for paying their salaries. The US-Taliban agreement made it clear that this was no longer the case, resulting in a sense of abandonment within the ANDSF and the Afghan population.' The ANDSF were dependent on US troops and contractors because that was how the forces were developed, the report argued, noting 'the United States designed the ANDSF as a mirror image of US forces'. 'The United States created a combined arms military structure that required a high degree of professional military sophistication and leadership,' it said. 'The United States also created a non-commissioned officer corps which had no foundation in Afghanistan military history.' It would have taken decades to build a modern, cohesive and self-reliant force, the Sigar document argued. The Afghan air force, the main military advantage the government had over the Taliban, had not been projected to be self-sufficient until 2030 at the earliest. Within weeks of Biden's withdrawal announcement, the contractors who maintained planes and helicopters left. As a result, there were not enough functioning aircraft to get weapons and supplies to Afghan forces around the country, leaving them without ammunition, food and water in the face of renewed Taliban attacks. The US had begun cutting off air support to the Afghan army after the Doha agreement was signed. Exacerbating its impact on morale was the fact that the deal had secret annexes, widely believed to stipulate the Taliban's counter-terrorism commitments and restrictions on fighting for both the US and Taliban. They remain secret, apparently, even from an official enquiry. 'Sigar was not able to obtain copies of these annexes, despite official requests made to the US Department of Defence and the US Department of State,' the report observes. The secrecy led to unintended consequences, the report said. 'Taliban propaganda weaponised that vacuum against local commanders and elders by claiming the Taliban had a secret deal with the United States for certain districts or provinces to be surrendered to them,' it said. The Sigar report also blames the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, who changed ANDSF commanders during the Taliban offensive, appointing aged loyalists from the communist era, while marginalising well-trained ANDSF officers aligned with the US. It quotes one unnamed former Afghan government official as saying that after the Doha agreement, 'President Ghani began to suspect that the United States wanted to remove him from power.' According to the former official and a former Afghan government Ghani was afraid of a military coup. He became a 'paranoid president ... afraid of his own countrymen' and particularly of US-trained Afghan officers. Ghani fled Afghanistan on the day Kabul fell.", "ac73808d65999b54ab4a909de802461ea661b323123ad639e8bee75a": "Hungary's nationalist leader, Viktor Orban, will be the star speaker at an extraordinary session of America's Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) to be held in Hungary this week, in an effort to cement bonds between the radical right on both sides of the Atlantic under the banner of the 'great replacement' ideology. In a speech on Monday, Orban made explicit reference to the ideology, which claims there is a liberal plot to dilute the white populations of the US and European countries through immigration. Increasingly widespread among US Republicans, the creed was cited by the killer who opened fire on Saturday in a supermarket in a predominantly black area of Buffalo, New York. Speaking in Buffalo on Tuesday, Joe Biden called it a 'perverse ideology' and 'a lie'. 'I call on all Americans to reject the lie. I condemn those who spread the lie for power, political gain and for profit,' Biden said. 'We've now seen too many times the deadly and destructive violence this ideology unleashes.' Orban argued this week that the western world was 'committing suicide' through immigration. 'I see the great European population exchange as a suicidal attempt to replace the lack of European, Christian children with adults from other civilizations - migrants,' Orban declared in a speech to mark the start of his fourth term in office. Echoing another popular theme on the American right, he argued that another form of cultural suicide was 'gender madness', a reference to the spread of LGBTQ+ rights in the west. The prime minister's choice of vocabulary was not accidental, Hungarian political analysts said, but was rather designed to underline the common ties between his Fidesz party, his self-described 'illiberal' form of government, and the American visitors arriving in Budapest for the first ever Cpac meeting in Europe. 'I think it is logical that he was signaling to US conservatives because of the upcoming Cpac,' said Zoltan Lakner, a political analyst, and editor-in-chief of the Jelen news outlet. 'He is trying to define himself as a global political actor, and at this point, he has kind of achieved that goal.'   One of the speakers of the event, Balazs Orban, the prime minister's political director, told the Guardian that 'there are political forces in every country that see the world the same way' as Hungary does, but he said the US right wing have showed exceptional encouragement. 'American conservatives are very supportive of us because they can see that we have huge domestic support and because they see Hungary as a conservative safe space,' Balazs Orban said. Alongside prominent Fidesz figures will be an array of other European hard-right leaders, including the former head of the UK Independence party, Nigel Farage, Herbert Kickl, head of Austrian Freedom party, and Santiago Abascal, president of Spain's Vox party. The US contingent will include several Republican members of Congress, Donald Trump's former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and the chairman of the American Conservative Union, Matt Schlapp. Most influential of all, the Fox News talkshow host, Tucker Carlson, will be attending. Carlson has arguably done more than anyone to popularise the 'great replacement theory' in the US, promoting it in 400 of his shows, according to an analysis by the New York Times. Carlson has developed particular ties with Orban, originally through his father, Richard, whose political consultancy, Policy Impact Strategic Communications, is a registered lobbyist for the Hungarian leader. Last year, Carlson broadcast a week's episodes of his show from Hungary, with a soft interview with Orban himself, putting both the prime minister and his government in a positive light, and glossing over EU complaints that Orban has curbed independent media and judicial autonomy, enriched his associates from the public purse and reshaped election laws to his benefit. Earlier this year, Carlson produced another pro-Orban programme called Hungary vs. Soros: The Fight for Civilization, highlighting another ideological bond: the portrayal of George Soros, a Hungarian-born billionaire and philanthropist, as a malign Jewish financier pulling the strings on immigration and other liberal policies. 'At this point, [American conservatives] are studying the Hungarian model and are looking at Hungary as a place where conservative policies can achieve their goals,' Boris Kalnoky, head of Mathias Corvinus Collegium (which was granted about $1.7bn by Orban last year), told the Guardian. 'Orban is someone who attracts attention. And these visits by Tucker Carlson, who has a huge influence in this community, certainly put the spotlight on Hungary.' Richard Kraemer, a American Republican and analyst at the European Values Centre for Security Policy (EVCSP) in Prague, said he was concerned about the security implications of CPAC's decision to hold its conference in Budapest which, after diplomatic expulsions in the rest of Europe following the Ukraine invasion, is widely seen as the most important outpost for Russian intelligence on the continent. 'If you walk into this environment, you're looking at - by at least one count -about a thousand security agency-related Russians that are in Hungary right now. And to put that in perspective, they have 170 diplomats in Washington,' said Kraemer, who co-authored a new EVCSP report this week that describes Orban's Hungary as 'a Russia and China proxy weakening Europe'. 'The are all these kinds of avenues whereby they're able to put agents of influence in there and in front of Americans, who are basically low-hanging fruit that have decided to get even closer to the ground by showing up in Budapest,' Kraemer added. 'What's particularly disconcerting to me about this is that CPAC has basically decided that the cultural wars being fought right now by American conservatives are more important than America's national security.'", "330196548e504cb3c4241d6dbd3427fbb1ba46f8dc076800012e62ac": "The French government is to challenge a city council's decision to allow bathers to wear the burkini - a full-body swimsuit - in its pools. The interior minister, Gerald Darmanin, said the move was an 'unacceptable provocation' that was against the values of the secular republic and announced he would seek to block it. Grenoble council's decision to loosen the strict rules of swimwear to allow people to dress 'how they like' at outdoor municipal pools, including wearing burkinis or swimming topless, has reopened the contentious debate over the place of religious symbols and clothing in France just weeks from a legislative election. Critics see the body-covering garment as a symbol of creeping Islamism and an attack on France's secular tradition while some feminists would like a complete ban, regarding it as a symbol of female oppression. Until now, it has been banned in public pools, along with baggy swim shorts and T-shirts, for reasons of hygiene. The current rules require male bathers to wear tight-fitting trunks. Grenoble's decision to allow the wearing of burkinis provoked an angry response from opponents. The regional authority announced it was immediately suspending public funding to the city and an investigation has been launched by the public prosecutor into an organisation behind the move. Laurent Wauquiez, of the centre-right Les Republicains party and president of the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes regional authority, said Grenoble had 'broken with secularism and the values of our Republic' and engaged in a form of 'separatism'. He had accused the local mayor, the Ecology-Green representative Eric Piolle of 'doing deals with political Islam ... to buy votes'. Piolle faced fierce opposition against the move and won the swimwear vote by a slim 29 votes to 27, with two abstentions after a fiery debate that lasted almost four hours. Piolle said he was delighted to be attacked by Darmanin, and said the decision was a 'feminist one'. 'All we want is for women and men to be able to dress how they wish,' Piolle told RMC radio afterwards. Grenoble is not the first to allow bathers to wear burkinis in municipal pools; in 2019, Rennes in north-west France loosened its dress code to allow the full-body swimsuit and other types of swimwear. In 2016, attempts by several mayors to ban the burkini from beaches in the Mediterranean caused a national row and were eventually ruled to be discriminatory. France's 1905 law on laicite - which roughly translates as 'secularism' - allows the wearing of religious symbols in public places, including swimming pools as long as they do not impinge on hygiene and safety. Muslim female footballers in France are currently engaged in a legal battle to overturn French Football Federation rules that prevent them wearing the hijab. The FFF bans all 'ostentatious' religious symbols including the Jewish kippa for competition matches. On Tuesday, the Grenoble public prosecutor opened an investigation into Alliance Citoyenne, the organisation that campaigned for the burkini after allegations that it had illegally 'collected and kept' personal information on people's ethnic origins as well as their political and religious beliefs. The gathering of such information is strictly prohibited in France. The local prefect, the state representative, is also to contest the decision to change the pool dress rules in the administrative court, claiming it contravenes both the 1905 law and legislation passed last August to combat religious 'separatism'.", "85fb77d547293eeb89ef784a76e597e86c3c813c0b9ef28cfb7b62c8": "", "c151e6bf193aecd0cb6021d6c5e54deb92b2c5189d9bf402c5bbfd59": "", "dc70ee329dbcdb3492d2ccb99271fb48b7e8fa6db0934c03cc1baec5": "", "dfaf49c8bda223db4181e1d4bac32b4d5310eae5e74caf82d6774f21": "", "a8759a7aa8b46f90c50fcc21a47fcffbd36d719c11ff3102c06dfcd3": "", "b94cad812e10252a62ee039d96832170d575ffba960d81e444deb989": "A reported shortage of some hay fever medicine comes in the middle of pollen season. Don't panic - for a start, stress is thought to exacerbate allergy symptoms. In any case, the active ingredient in short supply, chlorphenamine maleate, found in brands including Piriton and Hayleve, can make you drowsy - and there are lots of other antihistamine medications available. 'For anyone over two years old, you would recommend non-sedating antihistamines anyway,' says Margaret Kelman, a specialist allergy nurse and spokesperson for Allergy UK. Here's what else should help get you through the season. Kelman recommends non-sedating antihistamines for 'mild to moderate hay fever [to treat] the immediate itchy, watery, runny nose and itchy, watery eyes'. Eye drops containing sodium chromoglicate or antihistamines can help. If you have a stuffy, congested nose 'you would probably need a corticosteroid nasal spray. That's because there's a different kind of immune mechanism going on that causes that, and the spray will reduce the inflammation in the nose.' You should speak to your GP first, says Kelman. Locally produced honey has been considered a treatment and the theory seems sensible - that honey can contain pollen, picked by up bees as they collect nectar, so by eating it you can desensitise yourself to it - but there is no evidence it works. Any small amount of pollen in honey comes from flowers, not grasses and trees, which are the main hay fever culprits. There are other supplements and gadgets - including light-therapy devices that can be inserted into the nasal passages to treat inflammation - which claim to reduce symptoms but there is little evidence for them. 'Corticosteroid nasal sprays need a couple of weeks to start working,' says Kelman. 'Also it's a good idea to get yourself into the routine of taking anti-histamines.' Worcester University has a pollen calendar so you can start planning. Most hay fever is caused by grass or tree pollen. If you suffer in spring, you're probably allergic to tree pollen; in later months, it is probably caused by grass pollen. Of course their seasons overlap, and you can be allergic to both, as well as to weed pollens - often from nettle and mugwort - which are around at the same time, so it can be miserable. Generally though, says Kelman, 'if you know when your pollen seasons are, you can start pre-dosing a couple of weeks before'. The grass pollen season is starting earlier than average, says Dr Beverley Adams-Groom, a senior palynologist and pollen forecaster at Worcester University's School of Science and Environment, 'with the first high day expected in the south possibly next week, if the weather is warm and dry'. This year, the grass pollen season is likely to be average, she says, 'although it all depends on the June weather. If June is wet, then the season will be milder.' If you have severe hay fever, your GP may refer you to an allergy consultant. For the small number of people who don't benefit from antihistamines and nasal steroids, and whose hay fever is affecting their quality of life, immunotherapy can work. Drops or tablets containing doses of grass or tree pollen, placed under the patient's tongue daily or administered by monthly injections, 'trick the immune system into thinking [the pollen is] OK, and turn off the allergic response and so turn off the hay fever. Some people will use it all year round, other people will use it in the month before their hay fever starts, and then through the season,' says Graham Roberts, who is a professor of paediatric allergy at Southampton University, and runs an allergy clinic. Researchers are working on pre-season treatments that will continue to work throughout but currently 'we're nowhere near that point', says Roberts.  The Met Office has a pollen forecast, and on days of a high pollen count 'you know you need to take extra precautions during the day', says Kelman. This means making sure you have medication with you, including inhalers if you also have asthma. On high-count days, keep house and car windows closed, and don't dry clothes or bed linen outside. If you can, shift your life around the risk. On high count days, grass pollen is worse in early morning and late afternoon into evening, but in warm parts of the southern UK it can continue all night. In tree pollen season, evenings are less of a problem. Choose a trip to the beach over a day in the park and, if possible, stay out of cities because pollution exacerbates hay fever. 'People wonder why they have bad hay fever in big cities because there's not as much grass,' says Roberts. 'But pollution irritates your nose, lungs and eyes so the pollen has a much bigger impact on you. Pollution and pollen together can worsen the symptoms.' A hat with a brim and sunglasses can reduce the amount of pollen 'getting into your face and on your hair', says Kelman. A smear of balm such as Vaseline around the nose and eyes can help trap it. Wearing a mask can also help. 'We've become familiar with masks, and they've been found to be quite effective at reducing the pollen particles that we breathe in,' says Kelman. 'A simple cloth mask will act as a partial barrier.' A mask also warms the air we're breathing 'so that makes our airways less reactive'. To avoid bringing pollen into the house, Kelman recommends taking off outer layers of clothing when you come in. 'If you haven't been wearing a hat, then it's a good idea, when you've come back in after a day out, to get in the shower and wash your hair, especially if your symptoms are really bad, and especially before going to bed.' You can rinse your nasal passages and eyes with saline solutions from pharmacies, too. Pets can bring pollen inside - and they can suffer from hay fever too. Wipe cats and dogs down with a damp cloth. 'Grass and tree pollen are really fine pollens, [so] you might not necessarily see them, but they can be carried on their fur,' says Kelman.", "0784dff42d7e2dfd2b405e90d8cd356e243cb5731e43f6de8a163467": "", "05ef6ec6173f83640e621975d711e21f5b6453b164be8cb9d60b7a62": "", "cf1d291248723be919101ad46c63a8c5a1373405f6e0f49116d04f7e": "", "0ffd58438ff3c219b68e3c0b8b2d800fae275e8b14f84905e8825d26": "", "9b3991c9ab0ab11e64744df1bb8d8ea596d86c5ec92e12b92b1aa4eb": "", "0e3b8eb04f1dba83ce8e8132dce9218da8ef1664aefcb31491158333": "", "2fed25c9a43fa90d640b2e29f619dfe8cf4dbb2b25acb4308e3e17c6": "", "19a78f0bdc57290bbc818ffea848cef2936504fc4b5837e1cd398651": "", "2e8645708fe3cb49628077c47accb32fb85329713149e1efa485594d": "", "18e2e80d97cc41d047bc8bc76414ce5ebe8d1590bd0432a38e7b3aef": "The White House resumed its coronavirus briefings on Wednesday after a six-week hiatus as Covid-19 cases rose across the nation, with the new head of Covid response calling on Congress for additional funding to pay for vaccines and treatments. 'I want to make sure we have enough resources so that we can buy enough vaccines for every American. I think that is absolutely critical. We do not have the resources to do that right now,' said Ashish Jha, the White House's new coronavirus response coordinator, who replaced Jeff Zients in March. 'So without additional funding from Congress, we will not be able to buy enough vaccines for every American who wants one.' The last White House coronavirus briefing was held on 5 April. Since then, various mask mandates have been lifted across the country, including those on planes, trains and in automobiles. Jha explained that the administration has not stopped fighting the virus, however, noting that it has increased its rapid test kits allocated to each household from four to eight kits. 'We know there are multigenerational households, we know that there are households with more than four people and we want to make sure that we make as many tests as we can possibly make available,' he said. Jha also revealed that the administration has seen a dramatic increase in the use of the Covid-19 pill Paxlovid, with demand increasing fourfold in just the previous month. 'Our latest estimates are that about 20,000 prescriptions of Paxlovid are being given out every day. I think that is actually a really important reason why, despite the very substantial increase in infections, we have not seen a commensurate increase in deaths,' Jha said. Jha also renewed his pleas for Congress to authorize additional funding so the government could purchase more vaccines and Covid-19 treatments. 'If we don't get more resources from Congress, what we will find in the fall and winter is ... a period of time where Americans can look around and see their friends in other countries in Europe and Canada with access to these treatments that Americans would not have.' The resumed briefing comes as the US marks a grim milestone, now that more than 1 million people have been officially counted dead since the pandemic began in March 2020, and the real number likely to be much higher. The US has one of the highest mortality rates in the world: 303 dead from Covid-19 out of every 100,000 residents, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The huge toll has set the US apart from other wealthy nations, in a crisis exacerbated by the country's deep-rooted inequality, broken healthcare system and fraught politics. 'In terms of understanding why we had such a bad experience from the pandemic, we have to think about the systemic issues that already were in place when the pandemic arrived,' Steven Woolf, a social epidemiologist and population health researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University, told the Guardian. 'And, on top of that, mishandling of the pandemic by the government and by the public, frankly.' According to data from the New York Times, for the first time since 20 February, the daily average of Covid-19 cases in the country surpassed 100,000, marking a 61% rise from two weeks ago. Although deaths have been declining, hospitalizations have been on the rise: up by 25% in the past two weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, Rochelle Walensky, reaffirmed the importance of booster shots at the briefing. 'Our vaccine effectiveness cohort studies have shown Covid-19 vaccines generally remain effective in preventing severe disease, including protecting against Omicron. However, we also know that protection from Covid-19 vaccines wanes, or becomes less protective over time, especially in the Omicron era,' she said. 'This is one of the reasons vaccine boosters are so important.'", "e52d9bbb5bd656565df59dfbea5569d1464ff182e9f18c2df6122614": "Conservative officials are coming under increasing pressure to remove the whip from an MP arrested over claims of rape and sexual assault, or ensure he does not come to Westminster, as it emerged one alleged offence is connected to someone under 18. The man in his 50s has been bailed after being arrested on Tuesday over a series of alleged offences spanning seven years from 2002. One accusation concerns alleged abuse of position of trust, under a law that forbids sexual activity with anyone under 18 by an adult who is in a role of trust or authority over them. The MP has not been suspended, lost the whip or been formally barred from the Commons. Chris Heaton-Harris, the Conservative chief whip, has asked him to stay away from the parliamentary estate. Labour and trade unions have called for further action, saying that in any other work context a staff member accused of such offences would be suspended, with Labour arguing that naming the MP was a necessary consequence. Tory whips are understood to be unwilling to take action to name the MP for fear of identifying the alleged victim or victims, who are granted anonymity in cases of sexual assault. But they have been assured by the MP that he will not come to parliament, and say they are confident he will comply. Police do not usually name people who have been arrested but not yet charged, while a series of privacy based court cases mean media organisations now also rarely do so. Boris Johnson's press secretary rebuffed questions on Wednesday about the idea of proactively barring the MP from Westminster, adding that the prime minister only learned of the allegations on Tuesday, and was 'shocked'. However, Keir Starmer's spokesperson said it 'doesn't seem to be sustainable to argue' that the MP should not lose the whip, even if that meant naming them. 'It's a matter for the Conservative party what they do but our view is that given the nature of the allegations then the whip should be suspended and obviously at that point it would become public,' they said. The GMB and Prospect unions, which represent parliamentary staff, have warned that a voluntary bar on the MP is insufficient, noting that Imran Ahmad Khan, the now-departed Tory MP for Wakefield, attended Westminster during investigations which led to him being convicted for of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. Last month, unions representing workers at Westminster urged the House of Commons procedure committee to hold an inquiry into whether all MPs under investigation over allegations of sexual harassment should be banned. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union that represents senior civil servants, said for most employers it would be a 'no-brainer' for the person in question to be suspended. 'If it was any employer, you'd say OK there's an allegation here; it's going to be investigated; does that raise issues in relation to my other staff, in terms of health and safety?' he said. 'Does it raise issues around the confidentiality of the process? You've got to balance all of those things before you make a judgment.' He added: 'In most cases, with an employer, if the police were involved in a situation such as this, it would cross the threshold, it would be a no-brainer.' MPs are not directly employed, either by their parties or the Commons authorities, however. In another intervention, one of the lay members of the Commons standards committee, which deals with complaints about MP, said the situation with the MP was 'a calamity'. 'It's all very well to ask him to stay away, but what about the many constituency venues where that is not applicable?' Rita Dexter, a former deputy commissioner at the London fire brigade, said. 'What consideration has been applied to those?' Until 2016, MPs who were arrested were automatically named by parliamentary authorities. After concerns about privacy issues, they are now consulted, and named only if there is a reason of 'parliamentary privilege or constitutional significance', on the basis that this brings their treatment into line with that of others.", "4fc401f57f48e4694f69c486d20411278d01ca43913d17a3c29eeaea": "A former Minneapolis police officer pleaded guilty on Wednesday to manslaughter in the murder of George Floyd and agreed to spend three years in state prison, officials said. Thomas Lane's plea to a count of aiding and abetting manslaughter came a year after his former colleague Derek Chauvin, who was recorded by a bystander killing Floyd by kneeling on his neck, was convicted of murder and sentenced to more than two decades in prison. In February, Lane and former officers Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng were convicted in federal court of violating Floyd's civil rights. Sentences have not yet been handed down for them. Lane, 39, was tentatively scheduled to be sentenced for Wednesday's plea on 21 September. He agreed to serve that 36-month punishment at the same time as the sentence ultimately handed to him in the federal case, said a state court spokesperson, Jael McLemore. Thao, 36, and Kueng, 28, remain scheduled to go to trial in June on state charges of aiding and abetting murder as well as aiding and abetting manslaughter. Lane avoided that trial, which could take weeks, with his guilty plea, ensuring prosecutors also dismissed a charge of aiding and abetting murder. The top prosecutor in Minnesota, Keith Ellison, said he was pleased Lane had 'accepted responsibility in Mr Floyd's death'. 'His acknowledgment he did something wrong is an important step toward healing the wounds of the Floyd family, our community, and the nation,' Ellison said in a statement. 'While accountability is not justice, this is a significant moment in this case and a necessary resolution on our continued journey to justice.' According to McLemore, relatives of Floyd watched Lane's five-minute plea hearing virtually, less than a week before the second anniversary of his murder. Police confronted Floyd, who was Black, on 25 May 2020, after a store clerk accused Floyd of paying for cigarettes with a fake $20 bill. As a bystander filmed, Chauvin - who is white - used his knee to pin down Floyd, who was handcuffed, by his neck and from behind for more than nine minutes. Lane, Kueng and Thao stood nearby. The video captured Lane asking Chauvin if they should roll Floyd over. Chauvin brushed off the question, and Lane relented, though he knew the position was mortally dangerous, according to records filed in court on Wednesday. Protests calling for racial justice erupted across the US and the world as footage of Floyd's death went viral. The four officers were eventually arrested and charged. A state jury convicted Chauvin of murder and manslaughter in April last year and a judge later sentenced him to 22 and a half years in prison. He pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Floyd's civil rights through unreasonable force and by ignoring his medical needs, among other charges, and awaits sentencing in that case. A federal jury found that Lane, Kueng and Thao also violated Floyd's civil rights, by failing to provide aid as he died. Jurors also determined that Kueng and Thao failed to stop Chauvin using excessive force. Lane is white, Kueng is Black, and Thao is Hmong American. When Floyd was murdered, Lane and Kueng were on their first week on the job.", "6f6337460479b28d5e007276fa6cdb52092a1b591d9097dc1983c507": "The World Bank plans to spend $12bn (PS9.6bn) to support low-income countries hit by shortages of food and fertilisers that have pushed prices higher since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Sudan, where inflation has rocketed above 250%, is expected to be among the countries that will benefit from the initiative, which the Washington-based organisation said should alleviate shortages over the next 15 months. The World Bank said the $12bn pledge would raise its overall commitment of unspent funds to $30bn, from a budget of $170bn, as it seeks to prevent low-income countries from being hit by famine and political unrest. In recent days, the UN World Food Programme's director has warned that war, extreme weather and Covid-19 are driving global food prices to levels 'that will cause social unrest in some parts of the world'. Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa's most populous country, has experienced a rise in inflation rise to a more modest 16%, though food inflation topped 18% last month, leading to calls for the government to increase support for low-income households. The World Bank said new and existing projects would receive $30bn - covering areas such as innovative agriculture, water and irrigation schemes, and higher welfare payments to the poorest families. Its president, David Malpass, said loans would allow farmers to fund investments in new methods of food production with lower use of fertiliser. Governments that have reacted to the crisis by restricting exports of food - such as India - were castigated by Malpass for making the global situation worse. He said that to increase next season's production, there needed to be lower trade barriers, a more efficient use of fertilisers, and 'repurposing public policies and expenditures to better support farmers and output'. Malpass urged governments 'to make clear statements now of future output increases in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine'. He added: 'Countries should make concerted efforts to increase the supply of energy and fertiliser, help farmers increase plantings and crop yields, and remove policies that block exports and imports, divert food to biofuel, or encourage unnecessary storage.' David Beasley, the head of the UN World Food Programme, said: 'If people can't feed their children and their families, then the politics unsettles.'  Hit by high prices and supply disruptions, Beasley said the UN had been forced to ration food supplies to millions of people around the world. 'If we're not there with a safety net programme, then the political extremists or whatever the case may be, will exploit that,' he said, adding: 'Next thing you know, you've got riots, famine, destabilisation and then mass migration by necessity.'", "9f60f4c567cfacf1d5c3fbece6b0ee07bf0fabd510b0527634325053": "", "7f6262dea02d01d10eb4ded0b04deb9a09d614647b8658a3870dd4ab": "The lead singer of New Order has attacked 'ludicrous' NHS waiting lists for mental health support, as he spoke out about his anguish at being unable to help his former bandmate Ian Curtis in the days before he took his own life 42 years ago. Speaking at a suicide prevention event in parliament, Bernard Sumner - who was a member of the post-punk band Joy Division, whose singer, Curtis, killed himself at home in Macclesfield on 18 May 1980 - described the suicide of a friend's daughter who had been told she would have to wait 18 months for help. 'You can't go on a waiting list if you are thinking of killing yourself. It's ludicrous,' Sumner said. 'You can't wait 18 months. You need help straight away.' There are 1.6 million people on NHS waiting lists for mental health services, with health leaders estimating a further 8 million cannot get specialist help because they are not considered sick enough to qualify. Sumner was speaking alongside the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and a health minister, Gillian Keegan, at an event exploring how suicide rates could be cut. It was introduced by Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker of the House of Commons, who was close to tears when he talked about the suicide of his daughter. 'We know there are massive waiting lists,' said Keegan, who also spoke about how she had lost a younger cousin to suicide. 'I worry about it every day.' She said the government was working to train 27,000 more mental health professionals, and provide more mental health support in schools and suicide prevention policies that particularly target high-risk groups, including men aged 45 to 55, new mothers and people leaving the military. Suicide rates in England and Wales have remained stable in recent years at between 10 and 11 deaths per 100,000 people, based on deaths registered by coroners following inquests into unexpected deaths. In 2020, 5,224 suicides were recorded, three quarters of which were by males. The suicide rate is markedly lower now than it was in the early 1980s when Curtis died, when there were around 14 suicides for every 100,000 people. Sumner described how Curtis had stayed with him for a fortnight before he died in 1980. 'I tried every night to talk him out of it,' Sumner said. 'He agreed with me but he was on a mission. It was going to happen. I don't know what more we could have done.' Only 23, Curtis was married with a young daughter, but his marriage was heading for divorce. He had depression and epilepsy and had made an earlier attempt to take his life. Sumner called for mental health professionals who are helping people at risk of suicide to start communicating with their families who may not know about the issues, in a challenge to current patient confidentiality rules. Keegan responded: 'It isn't easy because of the age of consent, and if someone doesn't want you to be involved, but more family involvement will help in many cases.'", "ce0787ad86ea139d7522405f33880122cbf2d1daff9e51062f50e051": "A woman who was attacked by a mountain lion in northern California says her dog jumped to her defense and was badly wounded in protecting her. 'I don't think I will ever be able to live up to how amazing and loyal she is to me,' Erin Wilson told the Sacramento Bee on Tuesday. Wilson, 24, lives in rural Trinity county, about four hours north-west of Sacramento. On Monday, she drove to the Trinity River near unincorporated Big Bar to take an afternoon stroll with Eva, her two-and-a-half-year-old Belgian Malinois. Wilson was on a path with Eva a few yards ahead when a mountain lion lunged and swiped at her, scratching Wilson's left shoulder through her jacket, she said. 'I yelled 'Eva!' and she came running,' Wilson said. 'And she hit that cat really hard.' The dog weighs 55lb (25 kg) and was outclassed by the cougar but battled fiercely. 'They fought for a couple seconds, and then I heard her start crying,' Wilson said. The cougar bit the dog's head and wouldn't let go, even when Wilson attacked the animal with rocks, sticks and her fists, tried to choke it and gouge its eyes. The cat tried to kick her off, scratching her with its back paws. Wilson said she ran back to her pickup truck, grabbed a tire iron and flagged down a passing car. That driver, Sharon Houston, told the Bee that she grabbed a long length of PVC pipe and pepper spray. Together, the women began beating the lion, which had dragged the dog off the trail. Houston finally sprayed the animal with the pepper spray and it fled, Houston said. Wilson was treated for non-life-threatening scratches, scrapes and bruises. Wilson's husband, Connor Kenny, told SFGATE that Eva had two skull fractures, a punctured sinus cavity and severe damage to her left eye. The dog had seizures on the drive to the vet but stabilized overnight. 'We are hopeful she will pull through this,' Kenny wrote. 'She's a fighter, clearly.' The dog was in guarded condition, said a statement from the California department of fish and wildlife. Wildlife officers have collected samples from the wounds for DNA analysis and authorities will try to trap the cougar, the department said. Mountain lion attacks on humans are rare but in such cases the animals usually are killed if they are caught. Meanwhile, Wilson said she hopes Eva will recover. She has started a GoFundMe page to raise money for the vet bills, and she's already planning how to thank Eva: with some new stuffed toys and a steak dinner.", "d95e3502b4317ec21c6471a58cc4c302d1fe2a782e56d28b4c619ec9": "A Japanese man who was mistakenly sent Y=46.3m (PS287,000/US$358,000) in Covid-19 relief funds has admitted he gambled away the entire amount in the space of a fortnight. The 24-year-old, who has not been named, was sent the sum in April as part of a local government programme to help residents who were struggling financially as a result of the pandemic. But rather than sending him the correct amount - Y=100,000 (PS621/US$774) - the town government of Abu, in western Japan, wired money intended for all 463 low-income households to his bank account, according to Japanese media reports. After local officials realised their blunder, they filed a lawsuit on 12 May seeking the immediate return of the money plus legal costs, but were apparently unable to contact the recipient. The man, who reportedly lived alone and recently quit his job working in a shop, agreed to return the cash but then claimed, without explanation, that it had 'been moved' from his account. Records showed he withdrew all of the money from his bank account between 8 to 21 April. This week, his lawyer said he had gambled the entire sum on online casino sites using his mobile phone, adding that it would be 'difficult' for his client to return the money because he does not own any assets. The mayor of Abu, Norihiko Hamada, described the man's actions as 'unforgivable' and said the town would do its utmost to recover the money. The man's lawyer said the parties involved were attempting to resolve the dispute, but legal experts said the town was unlikely to recoup its losses. 'Even if the town wins its suit and seeks to seize assets, if the man doesn't have any it will be hard to recover the money,' Hisashi Sonoda, a professor emeritus of criminal law at Konan University in Kobe, told the Mainichi Shimbun. Sonoda said the man's actions had been 'morally questionable' but added a criminal prosecution could be problematic given that people's right to withdraw money from their accounts is recognised by Japan's civil code.

I ate my dinner. He drank his. It was the night after Thanksgiving, and he'd been through hell. A broken leg. A busted nose. Lingering back injuries. Arrested by Swat cops after firing a shotgun in his house, believing he was about to be robbed. Rehab. Jail. Eviction. Despite all this, Slater seemed calm. Too calm. And I began to worry. After our dinner that night at the end of 2019, Slater asked me to come to his next court appearance. I promised I would. And then he did something unexpected: he hugged me. At first, I took it as a gesture of friendship. Later, I realized it meant a whole lot more. I first met Slater when I was researching a screenplay and needed to come up with authentic-sounding dialogue from someone who had seen combat. Slater seemed ideal, but after two tours in Iraq with the marines, he had such a gripping personal story to tell that I put aside my screenplay and instead profiled him for the Observer in 2014. On our first encounter, he scared the hell out of me - he was 6ft 1in, 230lb and heavily tattooed. The bearer of Popeye-sized arms and a lawn-mowered haircut, he possessed a fierce natural squint. Slater's nickname, spot-on for his daunting look, was 'Bear'. But appearances were deceiving. He was articulate, soft-spoken and self-deprecating. Inside his house, he introduced me to his French bulldogs, Beaux and Daisy, who smothered me with wet, slurpy kisses. A jar of marijuana buds and an industrial-sized bong sat on his glass-topped coffee table. 'It's the only thing that keeps me calm,' he said. At 18, he had enlisted in the marines because it was 'the most badass' of all the services. Since his full name was Christian Slater, just like the actor, his radio call name in the field became 'Hollywood'. But otherwise, everyone just called him Slater. On his first tour in Iraq, Slater was in the NBC unit, searching for nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. On his second tour, he was in mortuary affairs. The name was a euphemism. This was the detail that picked up the bodies - and the body parts. Even if some guy's remains were unviewable, the marines had vowed to return every last piece of him to his family, in keeping with their motto of 'No marine left behind,' which they spelled out with sandbags atop their bunker at the Al-Taqqadam airbase in central Iraq. Slater and 20 other marines had prepared for their mission by watching videos of suicide bombings and plane crashes. They collected colored ping-pong balls and chunks of raw meat, both meant to simulate body parts, and methodically scattered them around the grounds, then inventoried them on diagrams of human bodies. A veteran warrant officer told them their mission in Iraq would be the most honorable a marine could perform. But she cautioned, 'nothing we tell you in class will prepare you for what it will be like in the field. Absolutely nothing.' Her words proved prophetic. Early on in Iraq, as Slater propped up one slain American so others could take fingerprints and check for exit wounds, the man's brain tumbled from his skull. Most of the other marines dashed outside the bunker to throw up, but Slater held his position. Later, after an IED explosion obliterated an armored personnel carrier, two marines lifted up a corpse, only to watch it come apart in the middle and spill its innards on their boots. Meanwhile, others collected the various body parts - an arm, a leg, a face, a penis. 'Picking up human confetti,' recounted Slater. The marines called their dead 'angels'. By the end of their tour, they had sealed 182 'angels' in body bags and metal coffins for flights back home. They also recovered the remains of Iraqi civilians, children and enemy insurgents. Slater would never forget how anguished and angry their relatives looked when they were handed the bodies. Under a full moon and within range of Falluja snipers, Slater and the others extracted what remained of an Iraqi mother and her child after an army fuel truck rolled over her hatchback. To numb the horrors, Slater worked out maniacally at the base gym. Multiple sets, multiple reps. Dead lifts, presses, rows, curls and more, using up to 270lb of weight. Anything to help forget the work. He took endless showers 'to get the day's business off me'. On the day they finally left to return home, everyone in the unit turned to face the mortuary affairs bunker and shoot it a middle finger. After Iraq, Slater served as an embassy guard in Mozambique and Latvia. During a Nato summit in Riga, he posed for photos with President George W Bush. But then things started to slide downhill. Visiting his family in Mississippi, he was emotionally flattened, but quick to anger if they cut him short when he talked about Iraq. Every time he walked out the door, he saw the faces of the dead staring back at him. Every mail box, trash bin and newspaper kiosk loomed as a hiding spot for an IED. He would stay up for 72 hours, then sleep the next 72, as if on extended sentry duty. A serious spinal injury Slater had suffered during a tank-riding mishap in Iraq flared up anew. After surgery at the Bethesda naval hospital, he contracted a systemic and near-fatal infection. When a military doctor tried to acupuncture his ears for the pain, Slater threw him out of the room. He was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder shortly after. Slater drank heavily and became addicted to painkillers and antidepressants. He shuttled in and out of treatment programs, but not always willingly. When they were preparing for their mission in Iraq, Slater had led the others in their morning runs and calisthenics and pushed them to buy field gear, pay bills, update wills and sign powers of attorney. In Iraq, he was the hi-tech wizard who repaired the radios, generators and engines and operated the tracking devices inside the Humvees. 'He was 'the be-all, end-all, go-to guy,'' recalls Dan Cotnoir, a now-retired sergeant who was in Slater's unit. Some had bristled at his gung-ho attitude. He was 'a self-proclaimed meathead, what we called a 'hot shit' marine', says Jessica Goodell, another member of the mortuary affairs team. 'He was so hardcore, always in shape, always doing jobs above his rank, always taking on more responsibility and always telling me what to do.' But post-Iraq, Slater became the 'go-to guy' nobody could go to. In 2008, the corps retired him on medical grounds. Despite the corps' motto, he felt that if he died, 'nobody was even gonna hiccup'. The average number of daily suicides among veterans has been steadily rising over the past two decades, from 81 in 2001 to 125.5 in 2019, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. In 2019, the suicide rate among veterans (31.6 per 100,000) was substantially higher than the rate among non-veterans (16.8 per 100,000), the department said at the end of last year. The Covid surge has raised new concerns about a possible spike in suicides. By February of this year, the department had reported more than 20,000 Covid-related deaths among veterans and VA employees since the start of the pandemic. While mental health consultations for veterans by phone or video had increased, some VA officials worried because many facilities had stopped in-person visits to limit the virus's spread. Politicians have taken note. 'Far too many of our fighting men and women come home suffering from invisible wounds of war,' said Senator John Tester, Democratic chairman of the US Senate veterans' affairs committee. 'And the isolation of the pandemic has often made that suffering worse.' Slater tried to kill himself multiple times. Once, pumped full of booze and drugs, he nearly succumbed to hypothermia on the Gulfport, Mississippi, porch of his sister, Holly Slater Gibbs. Later, back east, he tried twice more to do himself in.  Others from Slater's unit went through similarly dark times. One female marine spiraled into drug and alcohol abuse after escaping a perilous relationship in which another marine, who was suffering from post-traumatic stress, had regularly threatened to kill her and himself with his gun when he wasn't hiding in closets. A third died mysteriously. A fourth tried to kill himself using the same meds the Veterans Administration still gives him to this day. Others in the unit absorbed so much psychological trauma that they have never been the same. Although they were eligible for Purple Hearts, few of the mortuary affairs marines sought them. How could they justify getting medals for their trauma, they felt, when they had been sending their comrades home in pieces? It seemed disrespectful and selfish to become such glory hounds. Slater moved to Oregon in 2010 and seemed to rebound. The climate was a relief from the heat and humidity of his native south and the sandstorms in Iraq. The waterfalls, rivers, old-growth pine forests and snow-capped mountains gave him solace. He found a therapist in Portland, the first one he had ever trusted. When his nerves became too jangled or his old war injuries flared up, he turned to marijuana, for which the state of Oregon granted him a medical prescription. He began working towards his college degree, intending to open a private security business. His French bulldogs produced a litter of pups. To have living, breathing creatures in his care felt good. They became his family. He made friends, too. One was Jessica Goodell, his fellow marine. While she was attending college in upstate New York and working towards her PhD, he showed up with bags of food, cleaning supplies and kitchen utensils. 'I want to take care of you,' he told her. Although their relationship in the field had been prickly, they ended up becoming close friends. When I interviewed Slater in 2014, he felt he was on the right track. 'I'm working on my degree,' he said. 'And I'm not trying to kill myself.' Afterwards, we occasionally met for a beer. In some ways, our friendship was remarkable. Here I was, an ageing child of the 1960s who had done everything he could to avoid Vietnam. And here he was, a combat-hardened marine who had performed the most gruesome duty imaginable. The difference between us could not have been more profound. I felt honored to be his friend. Sometimes, he would bring along his friend Kat Figaro, AKA 'Fig', a marine who had served with him in Latvia. She was smart and sassy and, to my great delight, both a lover of birds and someone who cursed like a marine. Other times, I would consider Slater in the context of my own family and, in particular, a now-estranged relative through marriage who fancied himself an authority on war. Not because he had ever served in the military, but because he had read some books on military history, always voted Republican and kept guns in his house. Trying to have a discussion with him was futile since he would steamroll me with his self-professed expertise on the nature of combat. How satisfying it would have been, I imagined, to watch Slater, in his quiet, self-effacing way, talk about his time in Iraq and reduce this blowhard to a puddle of shame. After our post-Thanksgiving dinner, I texted Slater several times so I could show up for his court appearance. I never got a reply. In January, I learned why. Two weeks after our dinner, he had taken a fatal overdose of drugs. His body was not discovered for three weeks. Friends knew he had been self-medicating. Inside the house where he lived before being evicted, they had spotted heroin, human growth hormone, ketamine and propofol. In his new apartment, where his body was found, police discovered a syringe, a burnt spoon, pills and his bong. 'He just danced with the devil once too often,' says his friend Dan Cotnoir. Many believe he hadn't intended to die. Just one night earlier, he had told Cotnoir and his wife, Lori, that he would come to stay with them in Massachusetts. Others, however, felt his dying was a deliberate act. When the police found his body, they discovered his driver's license, his Marine Corps ID card and his wallet laid out on a countertop, as if to leave a message. Nationwide, there are numerous law firms that specialize in suing the Veterans Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs over allegations of malpractice. One attorney, Peter Bertling, who is based in Santa Barbara, California, pointed to two cases he has handled that are linked to the West Palm Beach, Florida, VA medical center. Last December, Bertling filed a lawsuit on behalf of the family of Sgt Brieux Dash, a 33-year-old Iraq war veteran, who, in 2019, hanged himself at the center. A report by the VA's inspector general later found that Dash had received 'reasonable care', but also faulted the facility for failing to ensure adequate mental health training for staff, failing to correct physical hazards in the facility and failing to fix security cameras that had not been working for three years. Bertling is preparing to file yet another suit in connection with another veteran, who had also been under treatment at the West Palm Beach facility and who fatally shot himself while lying next to his wife in bed. Meanwhile, Bertling recently won a $1m settlement for the family of Gary Steven Pressley, a 28-year-old veteran who fatally shot himself in April 2019 in the parking lot of the Carl Vinson VA medical center in Dublin, Georgia, to 'escape the excruciating pain and suffering he was experiencing', according to the lawsuit. In the suit, Bertling accused the veteran's VA physician of cutting off Pressley's pain medication. Another Bertling lawsuit, still pending, alleges that the hospital switchboard operator and her private employer, with whom the hospital had contracted, failed to heed family warnings about the anguished veteran. 'These things are preventable,' says Bertling. 'But medical or mental health providers do not follow the VA's own policies, pain or PTSD are not properly treated and staffing is often inadequate or incompetent.' In the wake of Pressley's death, VA officials stated that it does not comment on individual suicides or pending litigation. It added: 'However, suicide prevention is the VA's highest clinical priority, and the department is taking significant steps to address the issue.' A major obstacle to helping veterans, according to Tester, has been 'the stigma to getting help.' Men like Slater are reluctant to ask for VA assistance, anticipating endless forms, skeptical shrinks and social workers and inept doctors. 'No one is gonna fight to claim they are broken,' says Cotnoir. 'They're too proud to do that. They want to fight to be better. If Slater needed more help, the VA should have been tripping over itself to get it to him.' And ex-marine Jessica Goodell adds, 'The military wants people who will deploy. If you show signs of struggling, they reprimand you. And suicide is considered weak and selfish.' After returning from Iraq and struggling with her own PTSD, Goodell went on to write a highly acclaimed book about her combat experiences, Shade It Black. (The title refers to the way the mortuary affairs marines would diagram a corpse when limbs or other body parts were missing.) Goodell believes civilians need to better educate themselves about what members of the military must do in combat, and about the trauma that endures after they come home. And yet, she is frustrated by what she terms 'a dissonance' in the messaging. 'On the one hand, the military struggles to tell the public what it does,' she said. 'On the other hand, it doesn't want the public to know.' Since taking the gavel as chairman of the veterans' affairs committee in January 2021, Tester has successfully championed laws to improve mental health outreach during the pandemic and bolster suicide-prevention efforts. Programs are under way to better educate VA mental health care providers; conduct alternative therapies with animals, sports, recreation and art; do more outreach in rural areas; and study the impact of living at high altitudes, which is thought to exacerbate instances of suicide and depression. When the VA doctors changed Slater's meds, his friends told me, he resumed self-medicating. Soon he was babbling incoherently, sleepwalking and hallucinating about fires and squatters in his crawl spaces. Then he got busted for the shotgun incident. From jail, Slater had called Gibbs asking for bail money. But he was evasive about what had happened. She pushed him to re-enter drug treatment and offered to fly from Mississippi to Oregon for his court appearances. He never spoke to her again. Gibbs believes the Department of Veterans Affairs failed him. 'The doctors gave him so much crap,' she said. 'Uppers, downers, mood modifiers. They use the cookie-cutter method for returning veterans. Give them as many pills as they want.' The VA in Portland declined to comment on Slater's case. It also declined to let me see his medical records, even though I was authorized by his sister to see them. After Slater died, the Washington county medical examiner's office in Oregon sent an investigator to his apartment to deal with his body. Steven Hargis, Washington county's chief medico-legal death investigator, said the procedures the investigator followed were nearly identical to the ones Slater himself had employed when he was processing the 'angels' in Iraq. Early in 2020, as Slater's dogs cavorted at their feet, 20 of Slater's closest friends gathered at a house in the Oregon woods to memorialize what they termed 'all his Slaterness'. Their recollections were telling: 'An outstanding leader ... always had your back ... ran at every challenge full throttle ... never wanted anyone else to carry his weight ... wrestled with burdens no other person should have to carry ... wanted to heal himself ... would stare at you if you ordered only a half rack of ribs ... the biggest goofball in the world ... made you feel loved and cared for ...' At the time of his death, Christian Hyde Slater, sergeant, United States Marine Corps, was 36 years old.", "3095e5c2481a610c006d827aa355e41be2e10417475065606be792c3": "The attack on Black shoppers at a grocery store in Buffalo was carried out by an 18-year-old white man who authorities say was engaged in 'racially motivated violent extremism'. The shooting left 10 people dead and is being investigated by the US justice department as a hate crime. Reports suggest the shooter had legally purchased multiple firearms, detailed his plans for the attack online for months, and claimed he was motivated by the 'great replacement' conspiracy theory, a racist and false idea that white Americans are being deliberately replaced by immigrants. He has been arrested and charged in the slayings. The massacre comes amid a rise in anti-Black hate crimes in the US, where murders committed by white supremacists and far-right individuals have dominated extremist violence in the last four years. Brandi Collins-Dexter, a senior research fellow at Harvard's Shorenstein Center who studies disinformation and formerly advocated with civil rights group Color of Change, spoke to the Guardian about how the massacre is rooted in America's long history of white supremacist violence and racist conspiracy theories. What was your initial reaction to the news? You're just horrified to see the community's pain. But I also think about the things we could have done as a society for us not to be here. It's incredibly disturbing, distressing and frustrating that we're still here after so many different episodes throughout history and in the last 30 years.  I also think about the fact that this grocery store in a Black community became a target of violence and how that will have traumatizing implications for many. I live in Baltimore, and the day after the massacre, I went grocery shopping in a white area. I didn't feel safe going into my normal grocery store.  What should we take away from this happening in upstate New York? As a country, we still seem stuck on this idea that systems of racism and economic segregation are southern or rural things or tied to specific places. But what we see in Buffalo and what we've seen in Syracuse - where my family is from - and what we'll continue to see is that there isn't a geographic confinement to the systems of harm. There are individuals across regions invested in ideas of 'extermination' who are willing to go to any means necessary to carry it out.  In Buffalo, I also think about all the systems that put members of the Black community in that particular grocery store at that time - how the highways were built, forms of economic segregation or how that area was a food desert for a long time before the community lobbied to get that store built. You tweeted that people should stop saying, 'This is not who we are as a country,' which we hear so often after horrific tragedies. Can you elaborate? I remember watching live footage of the insurrection on January 6, and seeing signs with sic semper tyrannis, the Latin phrase meaning 'thus always to tyrants'. That's a very specific frame. John Wilkes Booth said it before he assassinated Abraham Lincoln in 1865. We saw it 130 years later in 1995 when Timothy McVeigh murdered 168 people in an Oklahoma City bombing and was wearing a shirt with the phrase. We keep seeing it pop up, and it feels very present here. When we talk about misinformation and disinformation online, it's like a 21st-century spin on the same problem of conspiracies spreading in different communities. Throughout history, we've seen how people defined as white react when they believe there is a threat to their way of life, whether KKK members running for school boards in the 1920s or the resurgence of the Confederate flag in the 1950s. We see what happens when the conspirators are the people in power who perceive a loss of power. So it really does us a disservice to act like these things are strictly in a container. What if we said to ourselves, this is who we are as a country? How would that change how we approach systems, politics and what we do to try to prevent this from happening again? What's behind the significant rise in white supremacist extremist killings in recent years? The modern iteration of the 'great replacement theory' stems from Barack Obama's election and the toxic reactions to the first Black president and what that meant for white people in the US. That combined with the rise of big tech platforms and sites like Telegram, information overload online, data voids and context collapse that we see in pockets of the internet where people are living in these Petri dishes. Those are the conditions that allowed us to go from Timothy McVeigh in the 1990s to the consistent trend we see now. It's happening so often that the news cycle can't keep up, people can't keep up and we can't fully make sense of it.  What does that normalization look like? I anticipate we'll continue to see an increase in these killings, absent any sort of sweeping set of interventions. That is what feels really scary to me. I thought January 6 would force a conversation, but it didn't. Stuff got normalized. Every day, it feels like the floor is getting lower, and our expectations for what is acceptable in society change, and we're willing to accept more and more. And in the partisan politics of this environment, we're not legislating and we're not tackling these issues online.  It's really grim and frightening. How should we understand the modern Republican party's role in this environment? When you look at the Buffalo suspect's 'manifesto', it's kind of a cut-and-paste job from the 2019 Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque shooting that killed 51 people. It has inspiration from Ted Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber, 4chan memes and discussions about 'human biodiversity', which is a type of pseudoscience that has long been used to develop tropes and associations about Black people. These elements aren't all neatly tied to the Republican party. But what the Republican party has done is created a political home for some of these extreme fascists and mainstreamed some of this ideology. We've seen this with certain Republicans supporting the January 6 insurrection. When you look at this history of anti-Blackness - this othering - we see that the Buffalo massacre is deeply embedded in an American tradition of defining Black people as a stranger in our own land. It's about who defines America and who defines the US. You see this in media narratives, cultural products, who gets platformed and who is protected in free speech conversations online. These are all conditions that allow for people to feel like they own the rights to define who is American and who gets to live or die in America. That can't be strictly confined to the Republican party. How does the 'great replacement' conspiracy theory tie to anti-Black racism in America? It's easier to think of the 'great replacement theory' as something that's confined to immigrants, but it has a long history in anti-Black racism. There's the 1857 Dred Scott decision that proclaimed Black people were not citizens in this country. There's the pseudoscience used to justify the absence of adequate medical care. These ideas are implicit in 4chan memes, in 'accelerationism', in 'eco-facism'. It's about a whole cabal of things, but time and time again, anti-Blackness comes to the forefront. Black people are still by far the largest group of victims of hate crimes.It also tends to be underreported in the media just how frequently Black people are under attack in our homes, communities, on the street and in the grocery store. It's an unignorable element in the fight to define what a true democracy is in a country that is still grappling with this multiracial experiment. How should our leaders be responding at this moment? How can we make progress? We need gun control. We still haven't answered the question of why someone needs to have the type of weapons that he was carrying. And then there's the fight around critical race theory as the shorthand for telling a story of America that acknowledges its unsavory aspects and the tapestry of who has contributed to it. The absence of that storytelling in our education system allows somebody to convince themselves that they are the true savior of this country and have the right to take other people's lives. This isn't just a political football. There are deeper implications when somebody gets to overhaul curriculum and fire teachers in the name of a skewed story of America. We have tech companies that are too big to regulate and can't regulate themselves, and we see how these companies have become a platform for fascist regimes carrying out violence or individual killers. We have to tackle that question. It is marginalized communities, Black people and the people with the least amount of power who are paying the cost.", "a339917bdeb98dc62ee25f2d6a52c397e8dcda46a63c7071db62290c": "", "bd946819ede3bd9af80dba0abe0aa78920a6dfa6e1c72cc70b23ac28": "Workers at a Target store in Christiansburg, Virginia, have filed for a union election and, if successful, the store would be the first store belonging to the giant retail chain to unionize in the US. Target has long opposed unionization within its stores, with anti-union videos to discourage workers from unionizing, and earlier this year Target training documents for managers to prevent unionization within stores were leaked. Target has already reportedly pushed back on the union organizing effort in Virginia, trying to use union dues as a tactic to deter workers from supporting the union. But workers at Target are seeking to capitalize on a surging energy in the US labor movement after recent union victories at dozens of Starbucks stores and the first Amazon warehouse in the US. The last union election to be held at a Target store in the US was on Long Island, New York in 2011, where workers voted 137 to 85 against unionizing with the United Food and Commercial Workers. An administrative law judge ruled in 2012 that during the union organizing campaign at that store, Target violated labor law by interrogating and threatening workers over their unionizing efforts and the union election results were overturned by the National Labor Relations Board in 2013, but the UFCW opted against rerunning the election due to long delays. A pharmacy department at a Target store in Brooklyn, New York, became the first to unionize at Target in 2015, joining the UFCW, but Target sold off their pharmacy business to CVS shortly after the election win. In 2018, another Target store on Long Island, New York, voted against unionizing. Adam Ryan, who has worked at the Target store in Christiansburg, Virginia, for five years, founded Target Workers Unite in 2018, after organizing a strike against an abusive manager in 2017. Ryan and his coworkers recently decided to collect union authorization cards to formally submit a union election petition to the National Labor Relations Board after he says Target corporate and management ignored their petition to enact seniority pay, specifically a $2 an hour increase for workers with five years at the company and an additional $2 an hour for workers with 10 or more years at Target. The workers are affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World as a bargaining representative, while remaining independent in their organizing efforts. 'It just came to a point where coworkers said, well, this is just a waste of time. They're just having us going in circles and not giving us an answer,' said Ryan. 'They're not legally obligated to have to talk to us or provide a yes answer to this petition, even though they tell us they have an open door policy, but there is a way that we can force them to the negotiating table, through collective bargaining.' The workers collected over 30% of the required support through union authorization signature cards to file a petition for a union election and submitted it after their request for voluntary union recognition from Target received no response. A hearing is currently scheduled for 1 June to determine the size of the bargaining unit ahead of the election, which Ryan predicts Target will use to try to delay and stall an election date, a tactic that Starbucks attempted several times at the first few stores that filed for union elections. Ryan also explained that Target's frequent responses to worker complaints has been to cite that wages of workers range from $15 to $24 an hour, with benefits and a tuition program, but argued the tuition program is limited, that he doesn't know anyone at Target making $24 an hour, and that the benefits that he is supposed to qualify for are virtually non-existent. 'I average about 25 hours a week and I've always had open availability and requested more than that,' said Ryan, who argued he's received no paid time off aside from maybe a couple hours here and there in his five years at Target. A spokesperson for Target said in a statement in response to the union election filing, 'At Target, our team members are at the heart of our strategy and success, and we have a deep commitment to listening to our team and creating an environment of mutual trust where every team member's voice matters.' They added: 'We want all team members to be better off for working at Target, and years of investments in our culture of care, industry-leading starting wage range of $15 to $24 per hour, expanded health care benefits, debt-free education assistance, personalized scheduling and opportunities for growth have been essential to helping our team members build rewarding careers.'", "4dc29b3756b67f92ae91185df5865fd4c51a15a319d3f8ad5b511a81": "For Kathryn Mahan and her husband, Jamie, the front steps of their home in the northern New Mexico village of Las Dispensas were a family touchstone. The couple built the house themselves in 2015 and fashioned the steps out of concrete blocks. Every year they photographed their daughter, Rayyah, on them - as Rayyah grew, the steps stayed the same. The largest wildfire in New Mexico history has suddenly changed all that. The family evacuated on 11 April as a rapidly growing blaze on the nearby mountain of Hermit Peak roared toward their home, driven by winds gusting up to 70 miles per hour. Three days later they returned to find the house and all their possessions had been reduced to ash. The only thing that remained were the concrete steps. Rayyah sat on the blackened blocks to pose for a photo as her parents documented the devastation. The Mahans are one of many families who have lost everything in the huge blaze, now raging for more than a month. The Hermits Peak fire started on 6 April when a controlled burn conducted by the US Forest Service leapt its boundaries. It eventually merged with another wildfire called Calf Canyon, creating a mega blaze that has been largely unstoppable. The Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak fire has since ballooned to nearly 300,000 acres, as of Tuesday, making it the largest to ever hit the state. And while there have been no fatalities, thousands of people have been displaced for weeks as firefighters struggle to get the blaze under control. These evacuees are depending on local shelters that serve the largely rural area north-east of Santa Fe and south of Taos where the blaze has left a trail of destruction. Mahan is an ecologist who monitors forest health and was well aware of the threat of wildfire when she and her husband chose to build next to the Santa Fe national forest in the foothills of the scenic Sangre de Cristo mountains. The region is in a ponderosa pine ecosystem, like much of the upland south-west, and is especially vulnerable to wildfire in what has become the worst drought in 1,200 years. The family took precautions to reduce the danger, such as building up defensible space around the house. But their fortifications were no match for a convergence of extreme weather conditions, including hurricane-force winds and an exceptionally dry winter that left forests and grasslands parched. Many scientists believe these wind-driven spring wildfires are yet another unanticipated consequence of climate change in the American south-west. 'We are using every trick in the book to fight this thing, but the constant wind we have been experiencing day and night is unprecedented,' says Andy Lyon, a spokesperson for the south-west area incident management team. Lyon notes the fire experienced explosive growth the week of 9 May, when there was a 95-hour period of non-stop red flag conditions (the highest alert level from the National Weather Service for wildfire danger), including 50-60mph winds. And while the winds have died down somewhat over the past few days, record high temperatures predicted for this week will continue to challenge firefighting efforts. The fire remains only 26% contained, as of Tuesday. 'There are so many things going against us,' says Lyon. The fire is wreaking destruction on a culturally unique part of the south-west that was once the remote northern fringe of the Spanish empire, in the 17th century. Descendants of those Spanish colonizers continue to live on family homesteads that have been passed down for generations. The mostly unincorporated, centuries-old communities are nestled in stream-cut valleys and mountain foothills surrounded by national forest. Many residents are older, have lived their entire lives in the region, and take pride in their culture of self-sufficiency and connection to the land. Lyon says it has been hard to convince many of them to leave their homes amid the fire threat. In Las Vegas, a town of 13,000 and the largest in the region, displaced residents have been gathering at a shelter in an old middle school. The shelter was established by the Red Cross after the first evacuations in early April. Now led by an army of local volunteers, it provides breakfast, lunch and dinner to 100-200 people a day. On a hot, windy morning last week, the air was hazy with smoke and stray black embers occasionally fell from the sky. The middle school resembled a fast-food drive-through as vehicles waited in line to reach the front entrance. Pickup trucks arrived with pallets of water and toilet paper that were promptly unloaded by national guard troops. Evacuees pulled up in cars with belongings piled to the ceiling and pets in crates. They were looking for dog food, open campgrounds and information on when they could get access to their homes. Inside, the non-profit World Central Kitchen served meals cooked by local restaurants. The gym was filled with pallets of food and cots were set up in the corner. Toys, strollers and clothes lined a wall. T-Mobile was handing out phones with 30 days of free service, and the Federal Emergency Management Association was set up in a classroom to help people fill out disaster relief forms. Ruben Garcia, 85, has been living at a hotel in Las Vegas, New Mexico, since he was evacuated from his home more than a month ago. He is from the village of Rociada, 27 miles north-west of Las Vegas, and lives on 100 acres that have been in his family for multiple generations. Garcia's house was spared by the fire but barns and farm equipment were destroyed. Rociada remains under mandatory evacuation while crews continue to put out wind-whipped spot fires. 'I have had a rough time lately,' Garcia said as he ate lunch with his younger brother Leo at the shelter. Soon after being evacuated, Garcia fell and broke his ribs, compounding existing health conditions. His wife died last year. 'Rociada is the most beautiful place in the world,' Garcia said, longing to get back to his familiar surroundings. 'It is in the mountains and full of water.' Garcia's son Michael, who lives in Denver, says going to the shelter for a hot meal and conversation with fellow evacuees is currently the one bright spot in his father's life. 'He and Leo are there every day,' says Michael. 'They like to visit with people they know who are also displaced.' While approximately 20 displaced people sleep at the shelter every night, it is also a lifeline to hundreds more who, like Garcia, come for hot meals, supplies and other essential services. An older man walked up to the shelter entrance with a scrap of paper that contained three hand written phone numbers. He had just been evacuated from the community of Chacon and did not have a cellphone or a place to go. 'Can you call my friend Larry?' he asked Janna Lopez, a resident who runs the shelter along with a team of local volunteers. Lopez tried the numbers but none were in service. 'Sir, don't worry,' Lopez said. 'You should go inside and get a hot meal. We will take care of you.' Then she repeated her favorite Spanish saying, 'A barriga llena, corazon contento': full belly, happy heart. Lopez and about 50 other shelter volunteers have been working 12 hours a day every day for more than a month. Many are evacuees themselves and some, like Andrew Vigil, have lost everything in the fire. Vigil said he and his wife had worked non-stop for three years to earn enough money to buy one acre of land in the village of Teirra Monte. Vigil built a small cabin on the property and they also had a 24ft Winnebago. It was all destroyed in late April. Like most victims of the fire, they did not have insurance, meaning they'll have to bear the full cost if they choose to rebuild. 'When I went back to see the place, my gut was torn out of me,' said Vigil as his eyes filled with tears. Not long after evacuating, Vigil came to the Las Vegas shelter for lunch. Since then, he has been volunteering at the shelter every day for 10-12 hours. 'It helps me to be here,' he said last week as he manned the front entrance to greet arriving evacuees. 'I'm used to doing stuff and I want to go forward. I don't want to go backward because there is nothing left for me to go back to.' It will be hard, if not impossible, for many longtime residents in this rural part of New Mexico to recover from the destruction. San Miguel and Mora counties, where most of the fire is located, have poverty levels of 20%. There is the financial barrier of trying to rebuild without the support of insurance as well as the environmental hazard of an increasingly severe fire season. 'A spring fire season adds a whole new level of complexity to the problems caused by climate change in the south-west,' says Andrew Sanchez Meador, executive director of the Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University. 'Up until the last decade, wind-driven fire events in ponderosa pine forests were unprecedented.' Meador says one of the most important preventive measures is to reduce the fuel that a fire can consume. The ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona and northern New Mexico are like tightly packed tinder boxes after a century of fire suppression, and the institute has long championed mechanical thinning and prescribed burns to get rid of excess fuel and reduce fire danger. But with record windy and dry conditions, the timing for conducting prescribed burns on national forest lands located near residential communities is becoming increasingly tricky. Officials with the Santa Fe national forest have apologized for choosing the wrong day for their burn that inadvertently started the Hermits Peak fire. While Kathryn Mahan is grieving the loss of her home, she takes the environmental hazards in stride. 'For people now living in the rural west, the risk of wildfire will never go away,' she says. 'It is like living in tornado country. Eventually a fire will come to your town.' Mahan and her husband did not have insurance but they have decided to rebuild. The concrete steps will once again be part of a house. Their connection to the community is more powerful than the threat of wildfire. 'Everybody is taking care of everybody here,' she says. 'This is where we belong.'

Australian elections always have their own vocabulary and concepts sometimes baffling to outsiders - nowhere else does the word corflute appear so frequently, including this year in an extremely Australian 'stoush' over dobbing people in about corflutes. The 2022 campaign has added some fresh causes of potential confusion to the traditional recipe. Here are the main things you need to know. To the dismay of American political commentators, Liberals in Australia (the main party in the governing Coalition) are actually conservative, and the lower house is made up of MPs just like in the UK, despite sharing the name of the US House of Representatives. Australia has been through a lot since Morrison pulled off a 'miracle' election win in 2019. Through two years of the pandemic many Australians were barred from flying in or out of the country and state capital cities became the most locked down places on Earth. The death rate stayed comparatively low, but many felt that a lacklustre effort by the federal government to secure vaccines early coupled with an archaic quarantine system, meant that the pain lasted longer than it had to. The nation was also hit by natural disasters, including the recent catastrophic floods and the Black Summer of 2019-20, when Morrison was scorned for taking a holiday in Hawaii at the height of the bushfires. Both fuelled anger over Australia dragging the chain on climate change, the most bitterly divisive issue in the nation's politics for a decade. Labor has promised a somewhat more ambitious target for emissions cuts, but the main campaign battle has been over the cost of living crisis. Inflation hit 5.1% in the last quarter, adding to the economic strain of stagnating wages and one of the most insanely expensive housing markets in the world. The Coalition has also tried to weaponise China's assertive moves in the region against Labor. Morrison hopes he has convinced the electorate that it is better to stick with the devil they know, even while admitting his own personality is not winning hearts and minds. Albanese is not the only one challenging the government. As a testament to the growing frustration of small-l liberal voters in traditionally safe large-L Liberal city seats, independents have received huge attention from the media. Most prominently, a number of cashed-up, climate-focused, predominantly female candidates are threatening to unseat high-profile members of the government by targeting the 'teal' vote, which for those who didn't go to art school, is the colour you get when you mix blue and green. These are traditionally (blue) conservative liberal voters who have become increasingly fed up with inaction on environmental issues. If they win even a small number of seats it could disrupt the entire power dynamic, possibly forcing a minority government. The Greens also hope to pick up seats, while on the right the United Australia party, lavishly funded by the billionaire mining magnate Clive Palmer, has plastered the entire country - and Queensland in particular - with its garish yellow ads promising voters all the riches of the earth (or at least an unachievable cap on interest rates). How far it will capitalise on the anger of Australians who feel that they have been failed by the political system remains to to be seen. In ancient Greece, if you were an eligible voter and missed the ballot you would be fined and daubed in red paint as a sign of shame for disengaging from your democratic duties. Australians decided in 1924 that being politically disengaged was more of a personality trait than a constitutional right and made voting compulsory for all. Recalcitrants face a $20 fine and the figurative red paint of being told to shut up every time they complain about the state of the nation despite not bothering to vote. The risk of further fines and even court for not filling in a ballot is there to give them that extra little push to get out of bed on Saturday morning. This has allowed Australia to maintain one of the highest voter turnouts in the world, with 92% of eligible voters casting ballots at the last federal election in 2019. This election may be the most consequential in years, and even though many voters have found the campaign hard going, that figure is unlikely to change significantly. For anyone in need of a further incentive to vote, there are carrots as well as sticks. Those carrots take the form of sausages served on a piece of bread with onion by volunteers, often raising funds for the schools that commonly serve as polling stations. The customary election day sausage sizzle, or Democracy Sausage has become so synonymous with the process that a website, democracysausage.org, exists to make sure your local polling station is selling the goods. The inclination to clog your arteries with meaty goodness is not the only factor that sets Australian elections apart. Voters are given ballot papers for both the lower house (House of Representatives) and the upper house (the Senate). In the lower house, voters have to number all candidates from their most preferred to least preferred in order. Votes are then counted in rounds where the candidate with the least first preference votes is eliminated, and their votes are transferred to the second preference of each voter. This is repeated until a winner emerges from the final two candidates. Preferential voting means that candidates with no chance of winning the seat can still have a substantial impact, and, more importantly, that it is all but impossible to waste your vote. The Australian Electoral Commission - a surprise breakout social media star of the campaign - does not mess around when it comes to upholding the principle that all votes should count where preferences have been clearly marked. It has confirmed that votes will be counted even if they are numbered in roman numerals, or if they are accompanied by a less-than discreet rendition of male genitalia, a recurring pastime for some Australian voters. Voting in the Senate is more complicated - if you want it to be. Broadly speaking voters can choose to vote for parties in their order of preference ('above the line'), or they can number each individual candidate ('below the line'). At this election there are 75 candidates in New South Wales, not an unusual number. This is where a bewildering array of minor parties hope to emulate the achievement of the Motoring Enthusiasts party and others who have in the past found a way to get elected with complicated preference strategies despite a tiny level of primary support. For a really challenging voting experience, voters who catch Covid after the Wednesday of the final week of the campaign (and therefore too late to fill in a postal ballot) must fill in their ballots over the phone. Good luck to all concerned. After Morrison displayed his talents on the ukelele by performing April Sun in Cuba on a 'behind the scenes' profile for commercial TV at the start of the campaign, the instrument has been adopted by opponents as a symbol of his often corny attempts to foster an image of the regular suburban guy. Later, Morrison began repeatedly referring to Albanese as a 'loose unit' to highlight his lapses in memory and alleged lack of policy coherence. What Morrison perhaps did not consider was that in a country where 'getting loose' is considered a patriotic duty, particularly among younger voters, winning the label of a 'loose unit' is in fact a badge of honour.", "2d2906dbec20fa46ac6dfcf0c43cfde7d2ab9a98dff01cd52aada76c": "", "6200437471002c3962dffee173ec31af405c0e226d85ab0d8304814a": "", "9e162500c48deb5d775bf65f77c9c1602e03c609ad109197cab17485": "", "df345a27c49608a5c30cbf5e482950fe9f49a344951e8eb7ece38c22": "The crypto crash will not reduce the sector's climate impact any time soon, an economist has warned, even though the environmental footprint of digital currencies is in theory set by their market value. 'Unless bitcoin collapses further, there's no reason to expect a decrease in environmental impact,' said Alex de Vries, a data scientist at the Dutch central bank and the founder of Digiconomist, which tracks the sustainability of cryptocurrency projects. His research shows that while the increase in a cryptocurrency's price encourages more computer capacity to be dedicated to it - increasing carbon emissions - that capacity takes a long time to disappear after the value declines, so the climate impact persists. Cryptocurrencies work by validating their transactions through huge numbers of 'miners', who use their computers to solve extremely complex maths problems in exchange for the chance of getting tokens as a reward, in a highly energy-intensive process. De Vries estimates that the bitcoin network uses about 204 terrawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity per year, around the same as the energy consumption of Thailand and above that of all but 23 sovereign nations. Other cryptocurrencies add to that footprint: ethereum, the token that underpins the NFT boom and the 'decentralised finance' sector, has an annualised footprint of around 104TWh (equivalent to Kazakhstan, more than all but 34 nations), while even dogecoin, a lighthearted spinoff of bitcoin famed for its community's positive attitude, consumes an estimated 4TWh annually. Those figures have barely changed over the past month despite $1tn being wiped off the crypto sector, and other measures of the amount of processing power devoted to 'mining' similarly show little decline. All major cryptocurrencies use electrical power in rough proportion to the price of the token because that dictates how much the reward given to miners is worth. For bitcoin, for instance, the reward for successful mining is 6.25 bitcoin every 10 minutes - currently, about $210,000. The higher the value of the reward, the more energy it is worth using to try to win it, ensuring that as the price of bitcoin rose from $8,000 in October 2019 to $60,000 two years later, the energy use of the sector rose too, from 73TWh to its current high. But while an increase in the price of cryptocurrency quickly leads to an increase in the carbon emissions of the sector, a crash like the one seen in past month doesn't do the reverse. 'It likely stops the environmental impact from going up any further,' said de Vries, 'but a bitcoin price of $25,200 is sufficient to sustain an annual electricity consumption of 184TWh.' That's because the cost of cryptocurrency mining is split over two main areas: buying the hardware, and paying for electricity. When prices are on the rise, miners buy new computers - expensive graphics cards for ethereum, or purpose-built 'rigs' for bitcoin - but once they are already set up, it's worth switching them off only when the cost of electricity alone is higher than the expected revenue. In a paper published in the journal Joule last year, de Vries estimated that a massive crash in the price of bitcoin, back down to $8,000, would be required to meaningfully reduce the total emissions of mining - and even then, it could sustain an energy consumption of up to 60TWh per year. The continued turmoil in the cryptocurrency markets means the sector may have further to contract. On Wednesday morning, tether, a stablecoin that effectively functions as a bank, paid out a further $1.5bn to depositors withdrawing their cash from its coffers. In the past week, the slow-motion bank run has seen $9bn of its reserves withdrawn, more than 10% of its total market cap and well over twice the cash-on-hand it declared it had at the beginning of the year. Andreessen Horowitz, a prominent venture capital firm and one of the key financial backers of the cryptocurrency sector, said on Tuesday that we may be entering a 'crypto winter', echoing a warning from the Coinbase chief executive, Brian Armstrong, that valuations may be depressed for some time.", "f69880672684b3a45ad97ab4677cd94e75adda57c5feff65441d9715": "A coffee bar in Florence has been fined EUR1,000 (PS846) after a customer got steamed up over the price of a humble cup of espresso. The customer called police after being charged EUR2 (PS1.70) for his coffee - a decaffeinated one, at that - at Ditta Artigianale in the centre of the Tuscan city. The man complained that the price was not displayed on a menu behind the counter. It was this error that landed the bar, which is celebrated for its coffee-making and has won winning several competitions, in trouble. Francesco Sanapo, the owner of Ditta Artigianale, vented about the fine on social media and defended his coffee, which he said comes from a small plantation in Mexico and 'is prepared with great care by my baristas'. He argued that the price of the coffee was displayed on a digital menu. 'They fined me because somebody got offended for paying EUR2 for a decaffeinated coffee [which involves a water extraction process]. Can you believe it?' Sanapo said in a video while holding up a letter from the police. 'Even today, someone can get so annoyed that they mobilise the police, who find us to be in the wrong due to an outdated law. This law must be changed because otherwise 99.9% of bars and restaurants would easily fall foul of it.' In Italy, the average cost of an espresso is EUR1, although more than 70% of bars increased prices earlier in the year due to supply chain issues and poor harvests. Consumer groups warned that the price of an espresso could rise to an average EUR1.50 this year. Sanapo said that Ditta Artigianale - described on Facebook as the 'first Italian coffee bar dedicated to quality coffee' - was somewhat 'revolutionary' when it charged EUR1.50 for an espresso when the bar first opened in 2013. 'There was negative and positive reaction, but until now I had never been fined,' he said. 'Nobody should be scandalised about paying EUR2 for an espresso any more,' he added, citing the rise in cost of raw materials. The Florence branch of Confartigianato, an association for small businesses, defended the bar. 'This is something that deeply embitters me,' its president, Alessandro Vittorio Sorani, said. 'A great deal of work goes into producing a quality product. Quality pays off and benefits everyone.' Some of the bar's customers leaped to its defence too. 'If this customer went to London he'd get the FBI involved,' one wrote on Facebook.", "cb2d93977509dabcf8364de48939530b79fda95640b449a787a0cc6f": "", "5ee8b9051705d699e162b08779b3f46589fddb6751f1cc754af554af": "The fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers who have ended weeks of resistance at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol remains unclear, after the fighters surrendered and were transferred to Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine's deputy defence minister said they would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials said on Tuesday they could be tried and even executed. MPs in Russia's State Duma said they would propose new laws that could derail prisoner exchanges of fighters who Moscow claims are 'terrorists'. Russian investigators have said they plan to interrogate the soldiers and could charge them with 'crimes committed by the Ukrainian regime against the civilian population in south-east Ukraine'. On Tuesday evening, seven buses carrying Ukrainian soldiers left the Azovstal plant in the port city and arrived at a former prison colony in the Russian-controlled town of Olenivka in Donetsk, Reuters reported. Russia called the Azovstal operation a mass surrender, while the Ukrainian army said the soldiers defending the steel plant had 'performed their combat task' and that the main goal was now to save their lives. 'Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,' said the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a video address. For weeks, hundreds of troops have been holed up in a warren of tunnels and bunkers underneath the steelworks, as Russian forces took control of the rest of the city after turning much of it into an uninhabitable wasteland. Many of those stuck at Azovstal had serious injuries, with limited medical care and dwindling supplies. In the last few weeks, civilians who had also taken cover in the plant were rescued after a deal was brokered by the International Committee of the Red Cross to allow them to leave for Ukrainian-controlled territory. Ukraine had been pushing for a deal that would also allow the fighters to retreat to Ukrainian-controlled areas, or for their evacuation to a neutral country. However, with that not forthcoming, Ukrainian officials announced in the early hours of Tuesday that the defence of the plant was in effect over. 'This was the only option,' said the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar. Russia's defence ministry said 265 Ukrainian fighters surrendered at the plant, including 51 seriously injured soldiers who would be transferred to hospitals in Novoazovsk in Russian-controlled territory in east Ukraine. It was not immediately clear how many Ukrainian troops remained in the plant. Footage shared by pro-Russia social media accounts showed groups of soldiers carrying out the wounded on stretchers amid the devastation outside the plant. 'An exchange procedure will take place for their return home,' said Maliar. Ukraine's deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk also said the fighters would be exchanged. 'God willing, everything will be fine,' she wrote. Zelenskiy sounded a more cautious note. 'The work of bringing the boys home continues, and this work needs delicacy - and time,' he said. Details of the agreement that led to the evacuation remain unclear, and a flurry of hardline statements from Russian officials suggested an exchange could still be some way off. Vladimir Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, promised that the fighters who surrendered would be treated 'in accordance with international standards', but this was immediately undermined by statements from two other Russian officials. Leonid Slutsky, a Russian MP who took part in negotiations with Ukraine earlier in the war, suggested Russia should lift its moratorium on the death penalty for fighters from the Azov regiment, one of the main forces defending the steelworks, calling them 'animals in human form'. 'Nazi criminals should not be exchanged,' said Vyacheslav Volodin, one of Russia's most powerful officials and the chair of the State Duma, during a speech on Tuesday. 'Our country treats those who surrendered or were captured humanely. But with regards to Nazis, our position should be unchanged: these are war criminals and we must do everything so that they stand trial.' Volodin did not directly address the surrender of the troops at Azovstal in his statement, but the context was clear as Russia's defence ministry released video of the evacuation of the Ukrainian fighters on Tuesday morning, saying some of them were members of the Azov battalion. Russia's justice ministry appealed to the supreme court to declare the Azov regiment a terrorist organisation on Tuesday, possibly introducing another hurdle to a potential exchange. On Tuesday evening Russia's investigative committee said it would interrogate the captured fighters and could seek to charge them with crimes against civilians in the Donbas region of east Ukraine. 'Russian investigators will identify the nationalists, check them for involvement in crimes committed against the civilian population, and the information obtained during the interrogations will be compared with other data available,' the committee said in a statement. Azov has been a key part of the Russian propaganda narrative about the war in Ukraine, which was originally launched with the supposed goal of 'denazification'. It was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and its commanders say it has moved away from its far-right origins. The defence of Mariupol has come to symbolise heroism in the face of the Russian attack for many millions of Ukrainians. As well as the boost to morale, Ukrainian military sources have claimed that by putting up such a fierce fight for Mariupol, the Russian army's advance was stalled. On Twitter, the Zelenskiy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak compared the Azovstal defenders to the small force of Spartans who held out against a much larger attacking force in the battle of Thermopylae in the fifth century BC. The defence of Mariupol 'completely changed the course of the war' and 'ruined Russia's plans to capture the east of Ukraine', he wrote. Sandra Krotevych, the sister of Azov's chief of staff, Bohdan Krotevych, said she had been in contact with her brother at 5am on Tuesday and he was still on the territory of Azovstal, but since then she had not heard from him. In recent weeks, she said, as the supplies hoarded in the steelworks began to dwindle and Russian strikes on the plant continued, the soldiers had been eating only once a day and had been drinking water from pipes and other unclean sources. Sandra Krotevych said the fighters had long realised Mariupol no longer had strategic importance for the Ukrainian army and were hoping to be able to bury their dead and evacuate their injured, but they had been holding out for a deal that would have allowed them to leave to Ukraine-controlled territory or a third country. 'To put it mildly, I'm a bit surprised. I am not happy about it and I would have liked to hear security guarantees before this happened,' she said in a telephone interview. Now the fighters are at the mercy of Russian authorities, with hardline commentators demanding they are not exchanged. On the state-funded RT, the commentator Anton Krasovsky called the evacuees 'wounded terrorists' and demanded they should not be handed over to Ukraine. 'Any Azov member given to Kyiv will be treated as our defeat, as our Russian capitulation,' said Krasovsky. He called on his viewers 'not to allow this', saying there should be a trial and 'RT can hold a livestream for their wives'. Amid such rhetoric from Russia, Krotevych called on the international community to find a way to ensure the soldiers were returned to Ukraine. 'Their lives are in the hands of international leaders. If they can find a way to save them, then all the citizens of Ukraine will be extremely grateful. They are heroes for the whole of Ukraine,' she said.", "55485ad74b3c0c61e6e59d9ca33875e7ab241d0f7485c1661b30b5b7": "", "bc2fc6fccb263ccb697366aa96fd54ef6745faf8c1078ea6aea576bf": "Cut off from the world and low on food and ammunition, many of the hundreds of defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mauripol were wounded, some missing limbs. Their capitulation had been inevitable for weeks. That moment came late on Monday as more than 260 - bearded, filthy, emaciated, and including 51 severely injured - laid down their arms and were evacuated amid a wider concession of defeat after 82 days of fighting in the besieged port city. 'The 'Mariupol' garrison has fulfilled its combat mission,' the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said in a statement. 'The supreme military command ordered the commanders of the units stationed at Azovstal to save the lives of the personnel ... Defenders of Mariupol are the heroes of our time,' it added. And while several hundred fighters remained inside the plant, their commanders admitted their mission had 'concluded' while officials continued with negotiations to 'evacuate them'. Late on Monday, five buses carrying troops from Azovstal were seen arriving in nearby Russian-controlled Novoazovsk. In one, marked with a Z like many Russian military vehicles in Ukraine, men were stacked on stretchers on three levels. In a long-denied victory for the Kremlin, a battle that has gripped the world's attention appeared finally over, leaving a city in ruins and perhaps thousands of civilians dead. With its urban areas sprawling along the coastline of the Sea of Azov in the shape of a comma, the siege of Mariupol came to define one of the most brutal episodes in Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. It was one of the first major cities to be encircled and viewed as one of the Kremlin's key objectives both for its economic importance and as a stepping stone in building a land bridge from Russia to Russian-occupied Crimea. The capture of Mariupol loomed large in the Kremlin's imagination for propaganda purposes too: as the home base of the Azov brigade, which at its 2014 inception, when the war in Donbas began, included far-right volunteers, some with neo-Nazi affiliations. (In recent years the brigade has been fully integrated into the Ukrainian military). It was the sheer levels of violence inflicted on the city and on its civilian population day after day, however, that has kept Mariupol in the headlines. The few who have been able to enter the city, including the International Committee for the Red Cross, have described conditions in the city as 'apocalyptic'. Those civilians who have managed to escape in the weeks of the encirclement have often had to run a gauntlet of Russian shell fire, even when humanitarian corridors were supposed to have been negotiated. Health facilities, including the city's maternity hospitals, have been hit in lethal attacks. In March, in one of the most grisly incidents, the Donetsk regional drama theatre in the city, where large numbers of civilians were sheltering was bombed, killing hundreds. Mariupol's war, like many other areas in Ukraine, began in the bitter winter chill of the early hours of 24 February as Russian shells began landing in the city. What marked Mariupol out as different, however, was its proximity to Russian-allied forces in the breakaway Donetsk region and the fact that, unlike many others places, it was largely shut off from reporters. Instead, Mariupol's story has been largely dramatised by its mayor, Vadym Boichenko. In the earliest weeks of the war Mariupol was not yet entirely cut off from the rest of the country. Reinforcements from cities as distant as Lviv were able to bolster the frontlines. But as the war ground on, even those few entry points were being shut off. With attacking Russian forces - backed by fighters of the notorious Chechen warlord, Ramzan Kadyrov - demanding the city surrender, on 4 March, Boichenko warned gravely of the dangers facing trapped civilians. 'We are simply being destroyed,' he said in a shaky video appeal, describing indiscriminate shelling of residential areas and hospitals. 'They want to wipe Mariupol and Mariupol residents off the face of the earth.' A day later Boichenko's warning was underlined by the Red Cross even as it tried to negotiate a humanitarian corridor for residents to flee, adding that many people were stranded in shelters without food, water or electricity. And the situation was worsening. By 12 March, Russian forces had captured the eastern suburbs of the city, tightening their grip. On 16 March, the theatre was bombed as hundreds of civilians sheltered inside. 'I do not want to believe in this horror,' the Mariupol municipality said in a statement on Telegram. An investigation by Associated Press published earlier this month suggested about 600 people may have died in that attack alone. The violence aimed at the port city has been a reflection on how long it has held out, with its defenders dug into well protected positions, including within the labyrinth of the sprawling Azovstal steelworks, covering an area of about 4 sq miles, including underground tunnels. Inverting history, the steelworks has become to Mariupol what the factory district was for Stalingrad's Russian defenders, even as the Kremlin claimed prematurely, on several occasions, to have taken it. But unlike Stalingrad, which could be resupplied across the Volga river, the Ukrainian defenders of Mariupol have been cut off from resupply by the surrounding Russian forces and also by their naval blockade of the Black and Azov seas. As the Russians advanced ever further into the city, the defending forces issued statements reflecting their perilous position - as they ran out of ammunition, unable to care for their hundreds of wounded, forcing units to surrender. Last week more than 1,000 soldiers of Ukraine's 36th marine brigade, including scores of officers and several Britons fighting in the city, surrendered. Other members of the same unit, who held on inside the Azovstal steel plant along with members of the Azov brigade and more than 1,000 civilians, were clear they could not hold out much longer, outnumbered 10 to one and with no hope of relief. A Ukrainian commander in Mariupol sent a message saying 'they will soon kill us' as he sheltered from Russia's bombardment of the steelworks where his troops were making a last stand. Among them was Serhiy Volynskyi, of the 36th marine brigade, who sent a message from inside the plant as Moscow stepped up its assault calling on the last defenders to give up or die. In a video message that was widely posted, Volynski had appealed for help from the world to allow them to leave. 'We are only defending one objective: the Azovstal plant where, in addition to military personnel, there are also civilians who have fallen victim to this war,' he said, adding he believed those in the plant had, at best days at worst hours, to live. 'They have advantage in the air, in artillery, in their forces on land, in equipment and in tanks.' The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, then ordered his forces not to storm the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold but instead to block it 'so that not even a fly comes through'. Before the order to surrender, that encirclement was total. Civilians who were finally evacuated from the steel plant in May spoke of the awful conditions, with so little food and water that adults were eating one tiny meal a day. 'No one came out of there unchanged,' said Oksana, an Azovstal employee who asked not to give her full name after her escape. 'They were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out.' And there are questions still unresolved, not least how many Ukrainian civilians died inside Mariupol, an issue unlikely to be resolved while it is under full Russian control. Ukrainian officials have suggested that the death toll could well exceed 20,000. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, has also warned of high casualties. 'We estimate the civilian death toll in Mariupol to lie in the thousands, while only with time will the true scale of atrocities, casualties and damage become clear.' Boichenko has suggested that Russia has been hiding evidence of the civilian deaths by shelling a mass grave. 'The invaders are concealing evidence of their crimes,' the mayor said. 'The cemetery is located near a petrol station to the left side of a circular road. The Russians have dug huge trenches, 30 metres wide. They chuck people in.' The other issue will be the fate of the surrendered Ukrainian defenders who Kyiv now hopes to exchange for Russian prisoners of war. 'We hope that we will be able to save the lives of our guys,' Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an early morning address. 'There are severely wounded ones among them. They're receiving care. Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive.' For those inside the Azovstal plant the concession of defeat was coloured with fatalism. The commander of the Azov regiment inside the steelworks, Denys Prokopenko, said in a prerecorded video message released on Monday that the regiment's mission was finally over, with as many lives saved as possible. 'Absolutely safe plans and operations don't exist during war,' he concluded grimly.", "3de0c436d15d46c5e94c3bee5a8c88ee1eaa8fcf4be2abd407e6d113": "It is Vladimir Putin's war - or least that's how the west characterises it. Not only was the decision to invade Ukraine made by the Russian president, but western military officials now say Putin is engaged in battlefield decision making 'at the level of a colonel or brigadier' as the Donbas offensive in eastern Ukraine unfolds. In part, the observation is not very surprising. Any idea that the Russian president - as commander in chief - would not be involved in the battle plans, particularly once the war in Ukraine started going badly, would be impossible to believe. Autocratic regimes tend not to favour military decentralisation. But it also comes at a point of embarrassing military failure. An attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces last week resulted in nearly 500 killed and the loss of over 70 armoured vehicles in a disastrous attempt to cross the Siverski Donets river, which took place, western sources said, not under the cover of darkness but in broad daylight . So if the western claim is to be believed, Putin would have approved the battle plan. Decision making at the 'level of a colonel or brigadier' implies a brigade level command of two or more battalions, the movement of 1,500 or more troops: precisely the kind of force that tried and failed to ford the strategic river. Prof Sir Lawrence Freedman from King's College London, said he judged the military statement about Putin's level of involvement to be plausible: 'Putin has chased the military operation, first by giving very little notice he would launch an attack and then pushing hard for quick wins. That's particularly been the problem with the second stage of the war, in the Donbas.' Yet claims about Putin goes further still. It brings to mind the idea of a political leader impatient of, or no longer trusting their generals - most notably the downfall of Adolf Hitler, who in the latter stages of the second world war, as described by biographer Ian Kershaw, refused to heed his generals' calls for tactical retreats in the east and insisted instead upon overoptimistic counteroffensives, as in the Ardennes in the winter of 1944/5. But there are no shortage of other examples. In the early stages of the Vietnam war, US president Lyndon Johnson and his administration began a bombing campaign aimed at communist North Vietnam in 1965 called Rolling Thunder, which defined the targets that could be attacked to avoid offending China or Soviet Russia. The confused strategy was an attempt to break the resolve of Hanoi by bombing lesser targets from the air, and a step in an escalating war that the US would ultimately lose. In the run up to the final Iraq war, the country's dictator Saddam Hussein decided that the country's air force should play no part in the war, with its planes 'in palm groves or buried them in the sand' according to an account in Foreign Affairs written three years after the war. The belief was the Iraqi air force would be no match for the western invaders - and that it was best saved for a post war future under his leadership that never transpired after the capture of Baghdad. But despite all the stories of meddling, the relationship between political leadership and military command has always been complex and at times fraught. Freedman, also the author of a soon to be published book on the subject called Command, says military decisions during war time are 'intensely political' and that it is up to political leaderships to 'set objectives, push senior commanders, ask questions'. The goal, Freedman argues, is to ensure there is 'a dialogue between politicians and the military' and to that leaders are not overruling legitimate objections or trying to micromanage the battle-plans at a time when they should be concentrating on wider diplomatic or political strategies. For Putin, as the war in Ukraine approaches its twelfth week, the question arises whether the Russian leader has the time to focus on all that is before him if he is embroiled in tactical decision making in a Donbas offensive that is stalling - and the impact that further military failures would have on his standing. In the past few days some Russian military bloggers and experts have begun to question the strategy. One popular Russian blogger who uses the pseudonym Vladlen Tatarzky on his Telegram channel wrote: 'Until we know the name of the 'military genius' who put a battalion tactical group by the river and he doesn't answer for it publicly, then there will never be reforms in the army.' It turns out the writer might have been criticising Putin himself.", "da476238f7803e9979adeed98b305e39ac1895b2b480f3b5b919a397": "Hundreds of Ukrainian fighters, including wounded men carried out on stretchers, left the vast steel plant in Mariupol where they had mounted a dogged last stand and turned themselves over to Russian hands. More than 260 fighters left the Azovstal plant -- their last redoubt in the southern port city -- on Monday and were transported to two towns controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, officials on both sides said. Other fighters -- their precise numbers unknown -- remain inside the ruins of the fortified mill that sprawls over 4 square mile in the otherwise now Russian-held city. Azovstal's fall marks the complete capture of Mariupol, a significant milestone in one of the bloodiest battles of the war. Footage published over the weekend showed the steelworks being bombarded. Wrapping up Mariupol's capture would give Russia an unbroken land bridge to the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and also deprives Ukraine of a vital port. It could also free up Russian forces for fighting elsewhere in the industrial heartland of eastern Ukraine. Fighting is increasingly focusing on the Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war, and an a effort to complete a wider encirclement of Ukraine's defending forces in the Donbas appears to have failed. A smaller-scale encirclement of Severodonetsk also failed last week after Russian forces were defeated with heavy losses in a series of unsuccessful attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets River at Bilohorivka. The river is increasingly becoming a dividing line between the two sides in the Donbas - the name given collectively to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - and around Kharkiv to the north. In the months before its invasion, Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow's rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long considered the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia's ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups - the smallest operational unit in Russia's army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops - were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and Belarus before the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had 169,000-190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk - some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces - before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia's invasion pits the Kremlin's large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land, and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine's south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin's oft-repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine would never join Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia's recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (PS8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia's state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany's north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe's most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe's energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees, and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.", "0c034fe297d7316579bc7f64406c4b5d745ab1c41ec2db6b52e4d4d2": "The British government's plan to walk away from parts of the Northern Ireland Brexit deal is destroying the repaired relationship with the EU, political leaders and diplomats have said. Leo Varadkar, Ireland's deputy prime minister, told a business dinner in Dublin on Tuesday night that the move was 'breeding mistrust in EU capitals'. A measure of the anger and disbelief within the EU was reflected in a tweet posted by the German diplomat Sebastian Fischer, considered one of the most mild-mannered of his cadre in Brussels. 'Let's just all threaten each other with breaking international law. Makes for really good partnerships #Brexit,' he tweeted on Tuesday evening. 'If you are wondering what friends and allies think ...' tweeted Ireland's foreign minister, Simon Coveney, in response. There is a growing feeling of disbelief and disappointment in the EU over the UK's position, given the goodwill Boris Johnson had built up over Ukraine. 'The fact that the UK government is talking openly about breaching international law is a matter of concern,' Varadkar said. '[It] stands in contrast with the enormous leadership the UK government is showing in supporting Ukraine against Russia, which has breached international law in a very serious way,' the tanaiste said. He co-designed the protocol with Johnson in October 2019 to deliver a breakthrough that helped the Conservative party leader present what he described as an 'oven-ready' real to the electorate in an election the following December. There are fears that the relationship between London and Brussels, which had deteriorated badly over the past four or five years due to Brexit, has once again been damaged. Diplomats have expressed incredulity at the British move, which threatens to splinter western unity against Vladimir Putin. But one EU source said they had expected the move and believe Johnson will ultimately pull back from any attempt to break a treaty signed two years ago. 'There will be American pressure on Boris Johnson. The US will not want to see a rift in Europe at this time. It simply will not allow a trade war,' they said. EU leaders have argued that there is scope to change the protocol but they had been waiting for the UK's response to proposals in October and subsequent suggestions laid out in February. Speaking in Dublin on Tuesday, Coveney said there had been 'no serious engagement since February' between the EU and the UK, contrary to claims by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss in the Commons that she had been engaged in talks for the past six months. 'Instead of engaging, the British government has decided that it is going to threaten domestic legislation to set aside elements of the protocol which is part of an international treaty ... I think that is going to cause a lot more problems than it solves if they go ahead and do that,' Coveney said.", "b71b70b74b7010d4411aa68244b63eeb72c4eeffe49705f2c2f851cf": "The Conservative MP arrested on suspicion of rape and other offences has been bailed, as Liz Truss said she was worried that there were once again 'appalling' accusations against a parliamentarian. The MP was arrested on Tuesday after being accused of rape and sexual assault offences spanning seven years between 2002 and 2009. Scotland Yard said the unnamed man in his 50s was also detained on suspicion of indecent assault, abuse of position of trust and misconduct in public office. The MP has not been suspended by the Conservative party but Chris Heaton-Harris, the chief whip, asked him to stay away from parliament. Truss, the foreign secretary, said she did not know the identity of the MP but defended the whips' decision, saying the party needed to wait until the conclusion of the police investigation. But she added: 'I'm very, very concerned about the reports that I've heard. Clearly, this is a matter for the police. 'The police are currently working on the case but it is worrying that we are seeing these appalling ... accusations, again, about a parliamentarian.' The arrest comes at a time when the Conservatives have faced multiple scandals relating to sexual abuse and misbehaviour. A date was announced on Tuesday for two byelections triggered by the resignation of Conservative MPs. Imran Ahmad Khan, the former MP for Wakefield, was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy, while the former Tiverton and Honiton MP Neil Parish admitted watching pornography in the House of Commons chamber. Both contests will take place on 23 June, with Labour hoping to win in Wakefield, and the Liberal Democrats positioning themselves as the challengers in Tiverton and Honiton. The Lib Dems pulled off a shock victory in North Shropshire last year after Owen Paterson resigned over paid lobbying. Another Conservative MP, David Warburton, who represents Somerton and Frome, has had the whip suspended while under investigation for sexual harassment by the Commons' independent complaints and grievance scheme. Details of the MP's arrest emerged during what the government had hoped would be 'crime week', with announcements on toughening up policing. The prime minister told his cabinet on Tuesday morning: 'Crime, crime, crime is what we want to focus on.'", "53236978e3f1d1ae8d1cf543c0b154d277654e636b6c50262035d68e": "The European Union has resolved to step up its defence strategy in the Indo-Pacific region in light of fears about China's growing presence and concerns for the international order sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 'Our motto is always to cooperate whenever possible, but to defend whenever necessary as well,' said Gabriele Visentin, the EU's special envoy to the Indo-Pacific. 'It's not directed against a country or another - it's a way of enhancing our capacity and our credibility in terms of defending our interests.' Visentin said there was no evidence to suggest a war was imminent in the region - which covers a vast sweep of the globe from the east coast of Africa to the Pacific island countries - but the EU was concerned the 'multilateral rules-based order will not be fully respected'. 'The pricetag that has been put on the breach of the multilateral rules-based order is quite high. It's surely a signal to others who might wish to break the multilateral order in such a violent way, well, then they know what they can encounter.' China is viewed as the biggest such threat in the region. Visentin said China was seen as 'a partner, a competitor and a rival' by the EU. Growing concerns over its military buildup and strategic intentions flared after a draft security pact between China and Solomon Islands was leaked in March, blindsiding the islands' traditional partners such as Australia, the US and New Zealand. The loosely worded deal triggered alarm that regional stability could be jeopardised, with China having the opportunity to base its warships in the Pacific less than 2,000km off the Australian coast. While France stated it was 'worrying on many levels, particularly concerning China's ambitions as a regional security actor', Visentin was reluctant to comment on whether the EU considered it a threat to security, until he had seen the agreement's details, adding that every state had the right to make sovereign choices. 'But of course, the signal that the Solomon Islands have sent to us is loud and clear: the EU and others have to do more.' Sujiro Seam, the EU's ambassador for the Pacific and Solomon Islands, said the deal pointed to the EU's need to step up in the Pacific region. 'EU's experience in matters of security and defence in the Pacific is very limited. It is a challenge for the future, and this security agreement between China and the Solomon Islands must be considered in the development of the European Union action on security and defence in the region. 'Traditionally in the Pacific, the European Union has been a development partner. The main challenge is to show that we can be something else, a strategic partner in security and defence.' In March, the EU approved a plan to strengthen its global security and defence policy. The Strategic Compass, as it is known, sets out a roadmap to improve the EU's ability to act decisively in crises and defend its security and its citizens. 'The adoption of this strategy is even more relevant, given the war in Ukraine,' Seam said. 'The war in Ukraine is a historic moment that contributes to the affirmation of European ambition in matters of security and defence.' A more intensive security plan would not involve the establishment of military bases nor the deploying of troops unless in a crisis, Visentin said, but rather conducting military training and live exercises on land and sea, boosting intelligence, and having EU ships pass through zones with maritime interest.", "468133a407b8666f43c27cd983ec18bdaa14205f921f91653b213f01": "Pennsylvania Republicans on Tuesday nominated Donald Trump's choice for governor, an election denier who was outside the Capitol on 6 January, but were divided over his candidate for Senate in a consequential round of primary contests that also saw the ousting of Madison Cawthorn, the scandal-plagued first-term congressman, in North Carolina.  Voters in five states went to the polls on Tuesday to pick the candidates at the center of some of this year's most contentious battles for control of Congress, statehouses and governor's offices. From Oregon to North Carolina, Idaho to Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the array of nominating contests tested both Trump's grip on the Republican party and Joe Biden's leadership of the Democratic party. In Pennsylvania - a perennial swing state and one of the fiercest electoral battlegrounds - Doug Mastriano, a far-right state senator who was a key figure in the effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the state, will face Democrat Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania attorney general, in a highly anticipated contest for governor. The Associated Press declared Mastriano, a retired Army colonel, the winner in a crowded field of Republican candidates. Shapiro ran unopposed. Despite his Maga bona fides, Trump only endorsed Mastriano in the final days of the campaign after he had consistently led in the polls. But his candidacy has worried party leaders concerned that he is too extreme to appeal to swing voters in the state. In North Carolina, Cawthorn failed to win re-election amid multiple scandals, losing his seat to Chuck Edwards, a three-term state senator and business owner. It was a stunning fall for the 26-year-old congressman, once seen as a rising star in the Republican party. But his rabble-rousing antics angered many of his colleagues, some of whom turned sharply against him in the race after he claimed without evidence that Washington figures he 'looked up to' had invited him to orgies and used cocaine. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy rebuked Cawthorn publicly over the remark. John Fetterman, Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor, handily won the state's Democratic primary for Senate that was complicated when a stroke took Fetterman off the campaign trail in the final weekend before the election. His victory sets the stage for one of the fiercest Senate races of the cycle - and one of the best opportunities for Democrats to pick up a seat in a year when the political headwinds are blowing against them. Fetterman, a plain-spoken Harvard graduate known for wearing gym shorts and championing marijuana legalization, beat congressman Conor Lamb, a moderate who aligned himself closely with Biden and state representative Malcolm Kenyatta, a leftwing state legislator. Fetterman is expected to make a full recovery from his stroke, but was not able to attend his election night party because he was still in the hospital. In a statement, Joe Biden said electing Fetterman, a liberal Democrat, would be a 'big step forward for Pennsylvania's working people'. Calling him a 'strong nominee' who could unite Democrats and win a general election, the president lashed out at his prospective Republican opponent, warning that whoever emerged as the nominee was guaranteed to be 'too dangerous, too craven, and too extreme' for the US Senate. As of late Tuesday, Fetterman's opponent was not yet known. Mehmet Oz, the celebrity physician known as Dr Oz, was trailing Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO, but the race remained too close to call. Conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, who enjoyed an 11th hour surge as Oz and McCormick lobbed brutal attacks on one another, finished in a distant third. 'Unfortunately we're not going to have a resolution tonight,' McCormick said during a speech at his election night party on Tuesday, citing 'tens of thousands' of outstanding ballots left to count.  On the Republican side, Oz struggled to unite the conservative base behind him. Hounded as a 'Hollywood liberal,' Oz embraced Trump's false claim of voter fraud and was rewarded with the former president's seal of approval. But when they appeared together a rally, boos could be heard whenever Trump mentioned Oz. Conservatives in the state also appeared tepid about McCormick, the husband of former Trump administration official Dina Powell. During the campaign, he and Oz unloaded their personal war chests, leveling such a ferocious campaign against one another that exasperated voters said they began looking at Barnette. Several states over, in North Carolina, the Trump-backed congressman Ted Budd bested ex-governor Pat McCrory and a dozen other candidates to clinch the Republican nomination for Senate. Budd had struggled to gain traction early in the race until a surprise endorsement from the former president elevated his candidacy. He also received a major boost from the Club for Growth, an influential anti-tax group that poured money into the race on his behalf. Budd will face Democrat Cheri Beasley, a former chief justice for the North Carolina state supreme court, who easily won her party's 10-way primary to replace retiring Republican senator Richard Burr. Beasley faces an uphill climb in the state, where Republicans have dominated the Senate race. If victorious, the trailblazing former public defender would make history as the southern state's first Black senator. In a setback for progressives, state senator Valerie Foushee defeated Nida Allam, the first Muslim woman ever elected to public office in North Carolina, in the hotly contested primary to replace retiring the congressman David Price in North Carolina's 4th congressional District, a safe Democratic seat. Foushee was one of the many candidates who benefited from the support of a Super Pac affiliated with American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobby group,which poured money into primary races with the goal of countering the rise of progressive Democrats sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. The group also targeted Summer Lee in the final weeks of her bid to capture the party's nomination in the solidly Democratic Pennsylvania district. But as of late Tuesday evening, Lee, a progressive representative, appears to have overcome the flood of money spent against her to defeat Steve Irwin in the race to replace congressman Mike Doyle, who is retiring at the end of next year. Lee's victory would be a major win for the progressive movement in the safely Democratic seat. If elected, she would be the first Black woman to represent the state in Congress. In deeply conservative Idaho, the sitting governor, Brad Little, defeated his far-right lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin, a Trump-endorsed candidate who twice attempted a power grab to ban coronavirus mask and vaccine mandates when Little was out of state on business. Little overturned the orders when he returned. And in Oregon, congressman Kurt Schrader, a moderate Democrat known for breaking with his party, was hoping to fend off a strong progressive challenge in a race seen as a test of the president's appeal among the party's base. And in an expensive fight for Oregon's newly created sixth congressional district, Democratic state representative Andrea Salinas was leading a sprawling primary that included a political novice backed by a cryptocurrency billionaire. If elected, Salinas will be the state's first Latina in Congress. The seven-term incumbent was a top target for progressives after joining Republicans in opposition to Biden's $1.9tn pandemic relief package, among other policy positions. Nevertheless, Schrader was the first candidate Biden endorsed this cycle. In Kentucky, the state's highest ranking Democrat, Morgan McGarvey, won the party primary for an open congressional seat to replace the retiring congressman John Yarmuth, who endorsed him. He beat state representative Attica Scott, who drew national attention when she sued Louisville police officers after being arrested during the racial justice protests in the summer of 2020, a disappointment for movement activists hoping to translate the grassroots energy into political gains. Charles Booker, a Black former state lawmaker who emerged as a powerful voice against racial justice in the aftermath of the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor in 2020, won the Democratic Senate primary in the state. The progressive faces long odds in his bid to unseat Republican senator Rand Paul in November.", "4bd7115fc92121c723015306d6332facb525449a603ab3ef86ba92c8": "UK inflation soared to 9% in April - its highest level for more than 40 years - as the rising cost of gas and electricity pushed household energy bills to record levels. The escalating cost of food and transport also contributed to the rising cost of living, deepening the crisis affecting millions of low- and middle-income families. Business groups said all sectors of industry and commerce were suffering from the steep rise in energy and fuel costs, with many facing a similar shock to their finances as seen during the pandemic but without the same level of government support. The Office for National Statistics said the 54% increase in the energy price cap in April, which took the average annual gas and electricity bill close to PS2,000, was the main reason for the jump in the consumer prices index from 7% in March. Average petrol prices rose to a record 161.8p a litre in April 2022 from 125.5p a year earlier. Diesel was another factor behind the increase in the consumer prices index from 7% in February after the average cost at the pumps hit a record high of 176.1p a litre, leading to an average increase over the last 12 months in motor fuels of 31.4%. The end of a temporary VAT cut for the hospitality industry also pushed up prices after restaurants and hotels said they were unable to cushion customers from the increase in the tax from 12.5% to 20%. A steep fall in the value of the pound on foreign exchange markets piled further pressure on businesses by adding to the cost of imports. Sterling has slumped since last month, from more than $1.30 to $1.24 after hitting $1.22 last week. Food banks have reported an increase in demand for food packages after the rise in energy bills, while many small business owners have said a combination of higher costs and tax increases have pushed them to the edge of bankruptcy. Figures from the Resolution Foundation showed the poorest tenth of households faced an inflation rate of 10.2% in April, significantly higher than the 8.7% affecting the top 10% of earners. The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank suggested the inflation rate experienced by the poorest households could be closer to 11%. Predictions that high inflation and a shortage of skilled workers have already begun to push the UK economy into recession are expected to add further pressure on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to offer further support to households and businesses. Bank of England policymakers are expected to react to the figures at their meeting in June by increasing interest rates for the fourth time since last December to 1.25%. However, opinions are divided over how much further the central bank will go to drive up borrowing costs should the economy contract in the summer and autumn. James Smith, an economist at ING, said it was likely the bank would raise rates twice before pausing. Labour said it was 'unconscionable' that Sunak was refusing to tax the fossil fuel industry to fund extra measures for poorer households. Conservative MPs voted on Tuesday night against a Labour motion for a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas firms that could generate about PS3bn. The opposition will table another amendment in parliament on Wednesday to put pressure on Boris Johnson to commit to an emergency budget addressing the cost of living crisis. The British Chambers of Commerce has also called for the chancellor to hold an emergency mini-budget. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the BCC, said: 'The scale at which inflation is damaging key drivers of UK output, including consumer spending and business investment, is unprecedented and means there is a real chance the UK will be in recession by the third quarter of the year.' Sunak has indicated he may offer further measures to boost the incomes of those on the lowest pay, although it is understood the cabinet is split over how to fund the billions of pounds that campaigners say are needed in extra subsidies or welfare payments, with some favouring a windfall tax on oil and gas companies. Labour market figures released on Tuesday showed that average total wages increased by 7% in March, pushed up by bonus payments to staff and consultants working in the finance, IT, construction and professional services sectors. However, income growth has not been evenly distributed. The average pay rise without bonuses was only 4.2%, hitting millions of workers with a fifth consecutive month of falling real wages.", "4bb3212c34fbfddec90965e389814c49db1d0cf654a0ca2fa41297b5": "Netflix is cutting 150 jobs as the streaming company seeks to reduce its costs after revealing it expects to lose millions of subscribers in the first half of the year. The widely expected cuts are mostly focused on its US operation, affecting employees in its sprawling film and TV divisions. This month, Netflix's market value was slashed by almost $60bn as investors panicked that the decade-long boom in the streaming sector had come to an end, after the company reported its first loss of subscribers in 10 years. As of December, Netflix had about 11,300 full-time employees, meaning the cuts represent 1.3% of its global workforce. Last month, it laid off about 25 employees in marketing-related jobs, including contractors who had been there less than a year. Netflix, which plans to focus on a 'less is more' strategy of fewer but higher-quality commissions of series and films, is estimated to be spending $17bn on making and licensing content this year. The company has said it expects to trim its budgets. 'As we explained on earnings, our slowing revenue growth means we are also having to slow our cost growth as a company,' a Netflix spokesperson said. 'So sadly, we are letting around 150 employees go today, mostly US-based. 'These changes are primarily driven by business needs rather than individual performance ... A number of agency contractors have also been impacted by the news announced this morning.' The company has blamed its slowdown on a number of factors including shutting its Russian operation, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It intends to start cracking down on widespread password-sharing among its 221m global subscribers. Netflix, which in several Latin American markets is testing charging a small additional fee to allow households to share their subscription, estimates that its service is shared for free with 100m additional homes globally. The company also intends to launch a cheaper, ad-supported tier this year to attempt to reignite subscriber growth.", "0f7c3e2b9a6d80ebbbf4a7b98d8c78ae462007aad6a8aff513d1f689": "African civil society groups have accused the United Nations of inaction over atrocities in Ethiopia, warning in a letter that it had not learned the lessons of the 1994 Rwanda genocide and that the 'situation risks repeating itself in Ethiopia today'. Tens of thousands of people are thought to have been killed and millions more displaced since war broke out between Ethiopia's federal government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the ruling party of the country's northern region, in November 2020. All of the parties in the war have been accused of crimes including arbitrary killings, mass rape and torture, while ethnic Tigrayans across the country have been subject to mass arrests amid a spike in hate speech, which has seen the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, refer to the Tigrayan rebels as 'weeds' and 'cancer'. In the letter to the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, 12 African civil society groups including the Kampala-based Atrocities Watch Africa, the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa and Nigeria's Centre for Democracy and Development called on him to 'provide leadership in ending the ongoing war in Ethiopia'. 'Twenty-eight years ago, the security council similarly failed to recognise the warning signs of genocide in Rwanda or act to stop it,' the signatories said, adding: 'We are concerned that the situation is repeating itself in Ethiopia today. We call on you to learn the lessons from Rwanda and act now.' In November 2021, the UN security council issued a statement expressing concern over the fighting, but it has yet to take any concrete steps towards resolving the conflict. Last month, a report by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch accused forces from the Amhara region of waging a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Tigrayans 'with the acquiescence and possible participation of Ethiopian federal forces'. Dismas Nkunda, head of Atrocities Watch Africa, said: 'With reports of ethnic cleansing coming out of western Tigray, there is real reason for concern that some of these crimes reach the level of genocide, and it's essential that the United Nations grasp the seriousness of the current situation and respond accordingly.' The UN human rights council has appointed a team to investigate abuses committed during the conflict, although the government has vowed not to cooperate. Tigray has been largely cut off from the rest of Ethiopia since the fighting began, with transport and communications links cut. About 90% of the region's 5.75 million population are in need of aid, and the region's health bureau estimates that at least 1,900 children under the age of five died of starvation in the past year. In March, the government unilaterally declared a 'humanitarian truce' to allow supplies to reach the region, but only a handful of aid trucks have arrived since then. The letter urges the UN security council to press for 'immediate and unimpeded humanitarian access [to Tigray]' and 'impose an arms embargo on all parties to the conflict'. The signatories also call for deployment of an international peacekeeping force led by the African Union, which has its headquarters in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.

A skull glowers down from the sand dunes on to Mablethorpe Beach, a portent of death and destruction, and a throwback to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament protests of the 1980s. It is here, in a 24-hectare (60-acre) disused gas terminal bordering the beach, that Boris Johnson's big bet on nuclear energy is being tested. Experts on nuclear waste have said that until the UK builds a large underground nuclear waste dump or geological deposit facility (GDF) to safely store the 700,000 cubic metres of radioactive waste from the country's 20th-century nuclear programme, no new nuclear plants should be created. It is a problem that has dogged the development of nuclear energy not only in the UK, but across Europe and in the US: how to safely and permanently store the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle. The solution of a GDF was put forward nearly 50 years ago, but the UK is no nearer to putting spades into the ground, and the cost of decommissioning and disposing of the country's radioactive waste has risen to PS131bn. When the prime minister recently promised eight new nuclear plants in as many years, the problem of the highly radioactive waste they would add to the stockpile was not mentioned. It is, however, something very much at the forefrontof the minds of those living in the remote Lincolnshire village of Theddlethorpe and the neighbouring town of Mablethorpe. Residents learned the seaside resort could become home to a vast nuclear dump - not from officials, but when a local BBC news programme broke the story, revealing talks had been taking place for two years. The gas terminal site is under consideration for the onshore facility and the dump would be dug six miles off Mablethorpe Beach, between 200 and 1,000 metres below the sea. It would be made up of subterranean tunnels and vaults, with natural and artificial barriers to minimise the escape of radioactivity, according to documents from Radioactive Waste Management, now part of the Nuclear Waste Services (NWS). Inside, the waste from the past 50 years of nuclear programmes, most of which is temporarily stored at Sellafield in Cumbria, would be deposited and sealed off for ever. The dump would also have room for another 73,000 cubic metres of waste from a new nuclear programme of up to 16GW. The revelations sparked a grassroots protest which appears to have spread quickly among the retired population, many of whom moved to the area for its coastal beauty. Anti-nuclear signs dominate country lanes, skeletons have been erected on the beach and outside homes, and a series of public meetings have been held over the past eight months by a group called Guardians of the East Coast. 'I was totally shocked when we found out,' says Sara Bright, who lives in Mablethorpe. 'This area was just not somewhere we ever thought they would put a nuclear dump. This is a tourist area, we have this beautiful beach, there is investment in tourism here. We rely on that tourism income and the idea that they could consider putting a nuclear dump here is just shocking to me.' It is responses such as these that have repeatedly seen off attempts to build an underground dump for nuclear waste in the UK. One nine years ago in Cumbria was rejected after an impassioned campaign by environmentalists and local people. This time, however, the approach has been different, NWS says. The government agency privately acknowledges that attempts in the past to find a site for the dump have been shrouded in secrecy. Any location for a GDF has to be based on science, the geology of the area and the technical requirements of a mammoth engineering project. Crucially, though, the community that will host it must also be supportive. This time, NWS invited communities to put their area forward. Four areas have identified themselves as willing to consider hosting the facility - Allerdale, Mid Copeland and South Copeland in Cumbria, and Theddlethorpe. NWS promises the community that hosts the dump will benefit from great economic development opportunities including jobs and investment in roads and railways. In Cumbria, where a million-pound pot has been made available for local projects, a trickle of the promised stream of money has begun flowing: PS47,801 on a BMX pump track at Seascale, PS9,576 for the Beckermet reading and recreation rooms and PS8,122 for an electronic scoreboard at Seascale cricket club. In Lincolnshire a community partnership is in the process of being set up. Jon Collins, a former leader of Nottingham city council and the independent chair of a working party set up in Theddlethorpe to decide on the GDF, has been holding meetings to provide information and answer questions from local people for several months. 'If this was just a process of someone trying to sell an idea to the community I would not have been interested in taking part,' he says. 'What I think is really interesting in public opinion terms is that sense of this is a big infrastructure project and it has got local implications; we need to work with the community and we are asking the community to make a judgment on this at the end of the process and if people don't want it then it doesn't happen. 'We talk to people about safety, about why the area is being considered and what kind of timescale we are talking about,' he says. 'Most people are reasonably open minded, some people are pretty much not in favour and some are concerned about the potential impact locally.' An initial assessment has concluded that the Lincolnshire site has the potential to host a GDF. Acknowledging the natural beauty of the area, NWS promises it will contribute to protecting conservation areas around the site and incorporate flood mitigation measures. The agency has also attempted to placate those who complain the dump will kill tourism in the area. 'There may be an opportunity to create a GDF/scientific centre of excellence, which itself could generate significant visitor traffic and even become a tourism point of interest,' the assessment says. For the Mablethorpe councillor and Labour leader on East Lindsey district council, Tony Howard, NSW's promises on behalf of government are nothing more than a bribe. 'Suddenly they want us to have a nuclear dump and they are promising us railways, roads, local jobs. It's just 30 pieces of silver, a bribe, the idea that everyone is going to go from selling burgers in the summer to becoming nuclear experts and working on this site is ridiculous. There will be specialists brought in to do the work.' He questions the very idea that nuclear energy is green, clean and safe at all. 'We know very well in this area the dangers of nuclear, every year we host children from Chernobyl who come to the seaside for a holiday. We are fully aware that if things go wrong at a site like this, they stay wrong permanently and that does not sit well with trying to promote the town as a place with a superb beach which is wonderful for families. It jars. 'We should be investing in solar, wind, desalination. This site would be perfect for that. Nuclear is a folly.' Ken Smith of Guardians of the East Coast is worried that the process of reaching a decision could take up to 15 years. 'In that time tourist investment will drain away. Why would you want to invest in a caravan park if you think a nuclear dump is going to be built next to it? This whole process should stop right now.' As the tourist season in Mablethorpe begins, NSW appears to be spreading its bets, seeking other areas to come forward. Its director for community engagement and siting, Simon Hughes, says: 'The UK search for a suitable site is about engaging in dialogue with communities and building an understanding of what hosting a GDF might mean for them, so that we can all make an informed decision. 'The previous process was very rigid and demanded decisions were made at set points and before all the information was available. The new process allows communities to engage in a much more flexible way, allowing questions to be answered without commitment. Communities also have the option to withdraw from the process at any time and will have to give explicit consent before construction can commence. If the local community doesn't want it, it won't happen. 'With over 60 years of legacy waste currently stored temporarily in surface sites around the country, developing a GDF is about delivering a safe, secure and environmentally sound long-term solution that protects current and future generations, ensuring it works for the host community and the country as a whole.'", "a2d0497856dc492bdb341ab013a75b947c969f270345975778f6c7f6": "The UK government's 'jet zero' plan to eliminate carbon emissions from aviation relies on unproven or nonexistent technology and 'sustainable' fuel, and is likely to result in ministers missing their legally binding emissions targets, according to a report. The study from Element Energy, which has worked for the government and the climate change committee in the past, says instead of focusing on such unreliable future developments, ministers should work to reduce the overall number of flights and halt airport expansion over the next few years. The report, released on Monday, was commissioned by the Aviation Environment Federation (AEF) and comes as five regional airports are in the process of seeking approval to expand. In addition, Gatwick and Luton have announced they will be submitting major applications later this year, while Heathrow has not abandoned its plans for a third runway. AEF's policy director, Cait Hewitt, said the findings showed the government's plan amounted to 'sitting back and allowing both airports and emissions to grow in the short term while hoping for future technologies and fuels to save the day'. 'These expansion plans will generate millions of tonnes of additional CO2 each year,' she added. 'Until the government sets out a realistic net zero trajectory for the sector, and the industry is on track to outperform it, additional airport capacity should be off the agenda.' The government's jet zero initiative was launched two years ago and is part of a raft of policies that aim to get UK emissions to net zero by 2050. Boris Johnson announced the proposals, declaring a goal of a commercial transatlantic flight that produces no carbon emissions by 2025, a claim that was widely dismissed by experts as a gimmick. The report adds weight to concerns about the viability of the government's plans, stating that it is unclear how the Department for Transport would 'deliver the technological improvements' it was relying on in terms of sustainable fuel and aircraft efficiencies. It concluded that ministers should instead aim to reduce the number of flights now - halting airport expansion plans, expanding carbon pricing and taxing frequent flyers and kerosene. Hewitt said: '[There is] a need for action now, including ruling out airport expansion and limiting demand, to ensure aviation makes a fair contribution to cutting emissions by 2035 and is on a pathway to net zero by 2050.' A DfT spokesperson said: 'We are anti aviation emissions, not anti-flying - we must reduce emissions from aviation whilst retaining our ability to fly.  'Our analysis suggests that the aviation sector can achieve Jet Zero without the Government needing to intervene directly to limit aviation growth, with net zero targets achieved by focusing on new fuels and technology, with knock-on economic and social benefits, rather than capping demand.'", "578176084d9f1d190b59ff622734a8e4fc1911d46bfc0d4692c66218": "Joe Biden has condemned those who spread white supremacist lies 'for power, political gain and for profit' during a visit to Buffalo, New York, where 10 people were killed in a racist shooting last Saturday. The US president was close to tears as he recalled the victims' lives, then became angry as he described forces of hatred that have haunted his administration. 'In America, evil will not win, I promise you,' Biden said. 'Hate will not prevail and white supremacy will not have the last word.' The mass shooting shook a nation that can sometimes seem numbed to atrocities and marked an alarming convergence of racist extremism, gun violence and the radicalizing effects of social media. It also revealed the scale of the challenge facing Biden, who ran for president to restore 'the soul of America' after his predecessor Donald Trump's failure to denounce a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and took office weeks after an assault on the US Capitol that included white nationalist groups. Authorities say Payton Gendron, 18, opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle on Saturday at the Tops Friendly Market in a predominantly Black neighborhood of Buffalo. He struck 13 people with gunfire, killing 10, and used a camera to livestream the rampage. Police have said they are investigating Gendron's online postings, which included a 180-page manifesto he was believed to have written outlining the 'great replacement' theory, which baselessly claims white people are being intentionally overrun by other races through immigration or higher birthrates. The 'great replacement' theory has been dragged into the mainstream by some Republican members of Congress as well as Tucker Carlson, the most watched prime-time host on Rupert Murdoch's Fox News network. In emotional and pointed remarks in Buffalo, Biden did not name names but made clear that such violence takes place in a wider political context. 'What happened here is simple and straightforward terrorism,' he said. 'Terrorism. Domestic terrorism. Violence inflicted in the service of hate and a vicious thirst for power that defines one group of people being inherently inferior to any other group. Hate. 'And through the media and politics the internet has radicalized angry, alienated lost and isolated individuals into falsely believing that they will be replaced - that's the word, replaced - by the other. By people who don't look like them and who are therefore, in the perverse ideology that they possess and are being fed, lesser beings. I and all of you reject the lie.' He added to applause: 'I call on all Americans to reject the lie and I condemn those who spread the lie for power, political gain, and for profit.' In recent years America has witnessed mass shootings driven by racist hatred in Charleston, El Paso, Pittsburgh, Atlanta and Dallas, Biden noted. 'White supremacy is a poison,' Biden said. 'It's a poison - it really is - running through our body politic, and it's been allowed to fester and grow right in front of our eyes. No more. I mean, no more. We need to say as clearly and forcefully as we can that the ideology of white supremacy has no place in America. None. Look, failure to say that is going to be complicity. Silence is complicity. It's complicity. We cannot remain silent.' The president also warned: 'The American experiment in democracy is in a danger like it hasn't been in my lifetime. It's in danger this hour. Hate and fear are being given too much oxygen by those who pretend to love America but who don't understand America. To confront the ideology of hate requires caring about all people, not making distinctions.' Earlier, Biden and his wife, Jill, laid a bouquet of white flowers at a makeshift memorial of blossoms, candles and messages of condolence set up under a tree outside the Tops supermarket. New York's governor, Kathy Hochul, and Buffalo's mayor, Byron Brown, greeted the Bidens and the state's two senators. The president, who publicly grieved the 2015 death of his son, weathered other significant personal losses and is often lauded for his empathy, once again found himself in the role of consoler-in-chief. 'It's not the same but we know a little bit what it's like to lose a piece of your soul,' he said. After visiting the supermarket, the Bidens went behind closed doors at the Delavan Grider Community Center and met the families of the victims. Ruby Davis, an elderly woman standing behind police lines two blocks from Tops, said: 'He's coming to show love because there's so much hatred around.' But more than love and support, residents said, they want action. Cherell Toe, 50, said: 'If laws don't change it's giving permission for this to continue and it sends the message that there's no consequences for your actions - for taking a life based on your color or race.' Biden was asked later by a reporter, before he boarded Air Force One to depart Buffalo: 'Do you believe that certain members of Congress, the Republican party, as well as Tucker Carlson, who have echoed the replacement theory, deserve some blame for violent acts like this?' Biden said: 'Anybody who echoes a replacement is to blame - not for this particular crime. But ... it's just simply wrong.' The president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Derrick Johnson, told the Associated Press: 'It's important for him to show up for the families and the community and express his condolences. But we're more concerned with preventing this from happening in the future.' Yet the trip underlined how far Biden still has to go in stamping out a rise in white supremacist groups or improving gun safety. A record 45,222 people died from gun-related injuries in the US in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Biden has asked Congress to require new background checks for gun buyers and ban military-style 'assault' weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines. But the efforts have been blocked by congressional Republicans. Republicans' drift to the far right has also come under renewed scrutiny. Liz Cheney, one of the few Republicans in the House of Representatives to break from Trump, tweeted that her own party's leaders have 'enabled white nationalism, white supremacy, and antisemitism. History has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse.' Barack Obama tweeted: 'We need to repudiate in the strongest terms the politicians and media figures who - whether for political gain or to boost ratings - have used their platforms to promote and normalize 'replacement theory' and other starkly racist, antisemitic, and nativist conspiracy theories.' On Tuesday the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, sent a letter to Murdoch and other senior Fox News executives urging them 'to immediately cease the reckless amplification of the so-called 'Great Replacement' theory on your network's broadcasts'. A White House national security council spokesperson said the Biden administration was implementing a 'government-wide national strategy to counter domestic terrorism'.", "a66a94684e2843264500f091024546105a988526e595f7746b465fec": "Pollution is killing 9 million people a year, a review has found, making it responsible for one in six of all deaths. Toxic air and contaminated water and soil 'is an existential threat to human health and planetary health, and jeopardises the sustainability of modern societies', the review concluded. The death toll from pollution dwarfs that from road traffic deaths, HIV/Aids, malaria and TB combined, or from drug and alcohol misuse. The researchers calculated the economic impact of pollution deaths at $4.6tn (PS3.7tn), about $9m a minute. The overall impact of pollution has not improved since the first global review in 2017, since when 45 million lives have been lost to it. Prevention was largely overlooked in the international development agenda, the researchers said, with funding increasing only minimally since 2015. Deaths from toxic air and chemicals have risen by 7% since the previous review and 66% since 2000, driven by increased fossil fuel burning, rising population numbers and unplanned urbanisation. This rise was offset by improvements in the 'ancient scourges' of water polluted by pathogens and poor sanitation and indoor smoke from cooking fires. The researchers said pollution, the climate crisis and the destruction of wildlife and nature 'are the key global environmental issues of our time. These issues are intricately linked and solutions to each will benefit the others. [But] we cannot continue to ignore pollution. We are going backwards.' Prof Philip Landrigan, at Boston College in the US and a lead author of the analysis, said: 'Pollution is still the largest existential threat to human and planetary health. Preventing pollution can also slow climate change - achieving a double benefit for planetary health - and our report calls for a massive, rapid transition away from all fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy.' Awareness of pollution was key, said Richard Fuller, at the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution (GAHP) in Switzerland, another lead author. He said action plans have been presented to 11 national governments to date: 'Ministers are just gobsmacked at how big an impact pollution is having in their country.' Measuring pollution and making it public also drives change, he said: 'It switches on communities to want to do something and yell and scream at their politicians. Everything can roll from that.' The new review, published in the journal Lancet Planetary Health, analysed data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease project, the most recent available, and found air pollution caused almost 75% of the 9 million pollution deaths. Toxic chemicals resulted in 1.8 million deaths, including 900,000 deaths from lead pollution, which is more than from HIV/Aids. Lead poisoning could significantly reduce intelligence across large populations, Fuller said, sources of which include water pipes, paint, backyard car battery recycling, as well foodstuffs such as contaminated turmeric. The number of deaths from chemical pollutants was likely to be an underestimate, the scientists said, as only a small proportion of the 350,000 synthetic chemicals in use had been adequately tested for safety. The cocktail of chemical pollution that pervades the planet has passed the safe limit for the stability of global ecosystems upon which humanity depends, researchers reported in January. More than 90% of pollution deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, such as India and Nigeria. While high-income countries, such as the US and members of the EU, had controlled the worst forms of pollution, the researchers said, few less affluent nations had been able to make pollution a priority. Pollution also crossed international borders, carried on winds or in food exports, said Fuller: 'If we're going to keep everyone safe, we need to help countries that have these toxic problems to stop the pollution at the source.' Unsafe water causes 1.4 million early deaths a year but this has been falling due to improvements in sanitation and healthcare, particularly in Africa. However, the UN estimates more than 2 billion people still do not have access to clean drinking water. The researchers called for increased funding for pollution control from governments and donors, better monitoring and a new independent scientific body to assess the problem, modelled on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose influential reports are agreed by all governments. 'Pollution has typically been viewed as a local issue,' said Rachael Kupka, also at GAHP, which includes the UN Environment Programme and the World Bank. 'However, it is clear that pollution is a planetary threat. Global action on all major modern pollutants is needed.'", "3ec73c1da0014971ddf7ccd0b00dbd12bc121a7cce7fea4fd01ee858": "Older TikTok users are using the online platform, regarded as the virtual playground of teenagers, to defy ageist stereotypes of elderly people as technophobic and frail. Research has found increasing numbers of accounts belonging to users aged 60 and older with millions of followers. Using the platform to showcase their energy and vibrancy, these TikTok elders are rewriting expectations around how older people should behave both on and off social media. 'These TikTok elders have become successful content creators in a powerful counter-cultural phenomenon in which older persons actually contest the stereotypes of old age by embracing or even celebrating their aged status,' said Dr Reuben Ng, the author of the paper Not Too Old for TikTok: How Older Adults are Reframing Ageing, and an assistant professor at Yale University. Interestingly, said Ng, most TikTok elders are women who 'fiercely resist common stereotypes of older women as passive, mild-mannered and weak, instead opting to present themselves as fierce or even foul-mouthed,' he said. The immense reach that these older TikTok users have means they have the potential to transform negative age stereotypes that proliferate on social media. 'There is considerable evidence that ageist stereotypes preponderate among the young on social media,' said Ng. These prejudices reached an all-time high during the Covid pandemic, during which the deadly virus was labelled a 'Boomer remover'. 'The strength of anti-age prejudices means the participation of older adults in social media is vital in ensuring that such ageist ideas are not left unchallenged,' said Ng, whose paper is to be published in the Gerontologist journal. The paper looked at 1,382 videos posted by TikTok users who were aged 60 or older and had between 100,000 and 5.3 million followers. In total, their videos, all of which explicitly discussed their age, had been viewed more than 3.5bn times. Ng found that 71% of these videos - including those from accounts such as grandadjoe1933, who has 5.3 million followers, and dolly_broadway, who has 2.4 million followers - were used to defy age stereotypes. A recurring motif was the 'glamma', a portmanteau combining 'glamorous' and 'grandma', with videos including those of a 70-year-old woman joyfully parading around the streets in a midriff-bearing top. Almost one in five of the videos analysed made light of age-related vulnerabilities, and one in 10 called out ageism among both younger people and their own contemporaries. Other videos positioned older users as superior to younger people. 'I may be 86 but I can still drink more than you lightweights' says one clip. 'I may be 86 but I can still twerk better than you,' says another, showing an octogenarian leaping up from a fall down the stairs with a twerk. Analysis by the Pew Research Centre has found a remarkable uptake of technology by older Americans during recent years: in 2000, 14% of people aged 65-plus were internet users; in 2019, it was 73%. Only half of adults owned smartphones in 2014, 81% of those aged 60 to 69 have them today. Emma Twyning, the director of communications at the Centre for Ageing Better said: 'We need to see much more diverse portrayals if we are to truly shift attitudes and cast off negative perceptions of growing older. Social media is the perfect platform to do this and to call out ageism more generally.' Stuart Lewis, the chief executive of Rest Less, said TikTok was the ideal platform for midlife influencers to take to the stage and defy ageist stereotypes. 'Creators are encouraged to be original, raw and unedited - making it the ideal soapbox on which to stand if you want a space to debunk stereotypes and be your uncensored self,' he said. Prof Fiona Gillison, from the Healthy Later Living Network at the University of Bath, who is leading work on challenging stereotypes about ageing, said the study was important. But she added: 'There is a balance to be struck in challenging stereotypes about ageing while also accepting that it is OK to want different things from younger people as we grow older, and accepting that our interests and abilities may change.' Ultimately, she said, people need to 'take the stigma out of needing adjustments as we age while also challenging assumptions that can accompany these. For example that having a hearing aid somehow implies that we are 'fragile' or 'infirm' in other ways.' @grandadjoe1933 The 88-year-old Staffordshire man is TikTok's wealthiest 'granfluencer', his videos apparently earning him about PS134,000 a year. Grandad Joe has won 5.4 million followers and 156.7 million likes for videos including one of him giggling after his youngest granddaughter gives his grown-up daughter 'attitude just like she gave me [when she was younger]'. @grandma_droniak 92-year-old Grandmother Droniak went viral, reaching 4.2 million followers, after laying down rules for her funeral including 'Cry, but not too much,' 'Bertha isn't invited' and 'Get drunk afterwards'. @grandmaann2 Grandmaann2 lures viewers to her account with the strapline 'I'm old so follow before I die'.

The marine scientist Dr Rob Enever and his team at Fishtek Marine, a fisheries consultancy based in Devon, designed small underwater 'potlights' to help protect fish stocks by replacing the need to use fish to bait crab and lobster pots. The lights were supposed to attract crabs into the pots. But quite unexpectedly, scallops, which can have up to 200 eyes, were more attracted to the LED lights. 'It's like a scallop disco - illuminate the trap and they come in. It's astonishing that no one else has discovered this before. It's quite an exciting find,' said Enever. 'This has the potential to open up a whole new inshore fishery and that's a global first.' Commercially, scallops are the most valuable fishery in England and the fourth most valuable in the UK, according to the latest government sea fisheries statistics. Most are caught by dredging, which at an industrial-scale is damaging to marine habitats. However, using scuba divers to hand-pick them is labour intensive, time-consuming and therefore more expensive. Enever hopes scallop potting could create a low-input, low-impact fishery that supplements the income of crab and lobster fishers with this high-value catch. In 2019, Enever, who specialises in reducing the impacts of fishing on the marine environment using technology, trialled the potlights with the Newlyn-based fisher Jon Ashworth off the Cornish coast. Although Ashworth did not notice any difference in crab or lobster catches, he found huge numbers of European king scallops in his pots. 'Pretty much every pot that we hauled had scallops in them and yet every haul without lights had no scallops. It was conclusive, there and then,' said Ashworth. 'To have proof that lights can be used to catch scallops has got to have some awesome implications looking forward.' In further experiments, a total of 1,886 pots were hauled - 985 experimental pots with lights caught 518 scallops; 901 control pots without lights caught only two. Overall, 99.6% of scallops were caught in pots with lights. This research, funded by Defra and Natural England, is outlined in a peer-reviewed paper published in the Journal of Fisheries Research this week.  Dr Bryce Stewart, a marine ecologist and fisheries biologist at the University of York, has studied scallops for more than 20 years and co-authored the paper with Evener alongside scientists at the University of Exeter. 'This is one of the most exciting things I have come across in my whole career - it's such a surprise,' said Stewart, who describes scallop eyes as 'pretty weird'. Scallops can have up to 200 eyes on their mantle, along the inner edges of their shell openings. 'Most animals, including us, have lenses but scallops don't. They have mirrors at the back of their eyes and they also have two retinas, one which senses darker things, one that senses lighter things, so they can possibly use that contrast to sense movement. Perhaps they prefer illuminated areas because they provide safety from predators or because it's easier to find the plankton they eat.' Powered by two rechargeable AA batteries, each small potlight is secured inside the pot and is expected to last between five and 10 years. The trap design has been modified with a ramp for easier access into the modified pot and Enever continues to refine the potlight technology - tank experiments indicate that scallops are more attracted to blue light than white light, for example. If the team can design a light system aimed specifically to catch scallops, that could open up the possibilities of doing this at scale, according to Stewart. 'Scallops are famous for their good vision,' said Dr Vicky Sleight, a marine biologist at the University of Aberdeen. 'Scallop eyes have a surprisingly high degree of visual clarity and their attraction to artificial light is intriguing. Follow-up laboratory experiments are required to understand why they are attracted into pots, and if it's a reliable and reproducible behaviour at a range of different types of scallop sites, then it's certainly an exciting prospect to grow a more sustainable scallop fishery.' The Fishtek team are repeating these experiments in four more UK locations, from Lyme Bay to the Orkney Islands, using different trap designs in various conditions and depths. 'Our goal is to get as close to a commercially viable fishery as we can,' added Enever. 'I genuinely think we can do that, it's got mileage.'

A 180-page manifesto, allegedly released by the accused along with a video of the attack, is rife with pseudo-scientific racism, antisemitic conspiracy theories and a call for others to mimic his violence. The screed is mostly plagiarized from other extremists and from the far-right 4chan. The 18-year-old white man charged with carrying out the massacre - before turning himself over to police at the scene - wrote that 'extreme boredom' drove him to 4chan in March 2020. Payton Gendron first fell into logging on the message board daily when coronavirus-related lockdowns kept many in New York state indoors, according to the timeline in the manifesto. His family told the New York Post that isolation and paranoia inflicted by the pandemic made him snap - possibly a preview of Gendron's legal defense. Gendron faces first-degree murder charges, which the justice department says they may prosecute as hate crimes. Most of those slain were Black, including Aaron Salter, a security guard who tried to stop the shooting; local activist Katherine Massey; and substitute teacher Pearl Young. The manifesto contains hundreds of racist and antisemitic memes borrowed straight from 4chan's politics boards and spells out the philosophy behind the attacks: the racist myth that Democrats favor open immigration policies and high birthrates for Black people to 'replace' Republican voters and seize control of America. That so-called rreat replacement myth, sometimes more bluntly termed 'white genocide theory,' has found particularly fertile ground in places like 4chan. 'We have seen (the great replacement myth) playing a greater role in mobilizing individuals to violence because it has a somewhat unique ability to foster a sense of emergency,' said Amarnath Amarasingam, assistant professor in the school of religion at Queen's University and author of an upcoming book on the radicalizing power of conspiracy theories. The manifesto details the baseless racism that underpins the philosophy, including the idea that Jewish people secretly control the world, and that the genetic differences between the races make them incompatible. One particular image, sourced from 4chan, claims to show 'the truth about race' - compiling a handful of debunked, misunderstood, or cherrypicked studies to assert the claim that certain races are inferior to whites. The manifesto even seeks to back up its claims with the long-abandoned pseudoscience of phrenology, which studies the sizes and shapes of craniums. While these claims have no basis in modern biology or sociology, they are established doctrine on 4chan, where even conversations on a board devoted to cooking frequently veer into racist slurs and junk race science. The popularity of these ideas on 4chan has bubbled up into the mainstream. The great replacement myth has been endorsed, in various forms, by vlogger Nick Fuentes and neo-Nazi organization Patriot Front and by more establishment figures like Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Senate hopeful JD Vance. In Discord chat logs believed to be written by Gendron, he writes, 'I only really turned racist when 4chan started giving me facts.' Early in 2022 he explained that only 4chan - including the board dedicated to Nazi ideology - gave him the real news he sought. 'White genocide is real when you look at data, but is not talked about on popular media outlets,' he wrote. He confessed to browsing 4chan daily and that he 'barely interacts with regular people'. 4chan is also notorious for praising and deifying other mass shooters and white supremacist terrorists. Gendron's alleged manifesto has ample evidence of their influence on him. The document borrows heavily from another manifesto written in 2019 by Brenton Tarrant, who killed 51 at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Tarrant was also a frequent user of 4chan and its sister board, 8chan, according to a government report. Tarrant's own manifesto, which was uploaded to 8chan before the attack, in turn plagiarized significantly from Anders Brevik, who murdered 77 in Norway in 2011 in an anti-immigrant spree. Brevik himself copy-and-pasted most of his manifesto directly from other anti-Islam sources, illustrating 'the broader ideas behind the great replacement conspiracy theory have been around for some time within various far-right movements', Amarasingam said. Besides Buffalo, both 4chan and 8chan have become politically significant forces in the US. Both boards helped form and foster QAnon, the far-right myth that Donald Trump is combating a cult of elite leftist pedophiles. The boards played a central role in constructing the lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump, which inspired the deadly Capitol riot on 6 January 2021. Then, last month, 23-year-old Raymond Spencer recorded himself shooting and wounding four people at random. He uploaded the footage to 4chan and continued posting right up until he committed suicide, as police closed in on him. A racist meme, popular on 4chan, was posted on the wall of the apartment Spencer used as a sniper's nest. Gendron and Spencer's cases vividly show how 4chan's toxic culture can radicalize young men, according to Amarasingam. 'You can hear it all over the Buffalo shooter's manifesto - a deep sense of urgency that there is an imminent collapse of white people and white culture,' the professor said. 'Combine all this with the furious nihilism, racism, and angst of 4chan and it all becomes deeply worrying.'", "0bf29654fd7726e070eaa03f66e2d8ff139f6efc25c987b84ed448c8": "Young New Zealanders are leaving in droves as borders reopen and economic conditions tighten at home. The latest data from Stats NZ found that in the year to March, annual net migration was negative, with 7,300 more people leaving than entering. That loss marks a dramatic shift from early in the pandemic when border closures and the relative safety of Covid-free New Zealand prevented many from leaving. In the year to March 2020 there was a record net gain of 91,700. Now, many New Zealanders - particularly young professionals and graduates - are heading off overseas once more. Some are driven by tough economic conditions in New Zealand, which is dealing with high inflation of 6.9%, housing unaffordability, and sky-high living costs: petrol, rents, mortgage interest rates and groceries are all on the rise. Brad Olsen, Infometrics principal economist and director, said the latest figures 'demonstrate just how momentous really the shift has been in New Zealand's migration outcomes', changing to a net loss from 50,000-60,000 annual net gains in the years leading up to the pandemic. 'It's a huge reversal - and the first time we've seen those negative figures since the global financial crisis, the Christchurch earthquakes and the Australian mining boom all combined in the early 2010s.' Stats NZ, the government's data and statistics agency, said the losses were driven by young adults, with a particular increase in New Zealand citizens aged 18 to 27 leaving. With unemployment already at a low of 3.2%, economists say the loss of more of the workforce via migration could create ongoing labour shortages. 'The difficulty finding workers is extreme around the country - you have a smaller working age population than the year before, at a time when everyone is desperately calling out for workers. [It] really just exacerbates the pressures that businesses are under,' Olsen said. In April, government documents estimated that 50,000 people would leave over the next year - but that the number could swell to 125,000 if the many young people who had delayed post-graduation trips during the pandemic left too. Asked about those projected losses, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said that overseas trips were 'part of our history' and a rite of passage for many New Zealanders, noting that she had spent time living in London. 'It has been part of our history as a nation to frequently have New Zealanders come and go as part of our overseas experience, building skills and talent.' Olsen said there were a mixture of contributing factors including pent-up demand from those who delayed leaving over the past two years, high living costs, housing unaffordability, and delays fully reopening New Zealand's borders, which meant lower numbers of migrants coming in.", "1a0ee281d81dd34e6f31458be73055c182e381da9b54d5d56b755321": "The world is at 'boiling point' and humanity needs to redefine its relationship with nature if it is to address a web of crises, from rising prices to extreme heat and floods, according to a report released ahead of a landmark UN conference. The research from the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the Council on Energy Environment and Water says the solutions to the interlinked planetary and inequality crisis exist, but calls for 'bold science-based decision-making' to 'completely rethink our way of living,'. 'In many ways, the world is at boiling point - with extreme temperatures in south Asia, escalating fuel and food prices, and war and conflict,' said Asa Persson, research director at SEI. 'In our report, we seek to connect the big picture of intertwined planetary and inequality crises with the promising momentum for change that we see in public awareness and key technologies, to shift from urgency to agency' The report is published ahead of a UN meeting, Stockholm 50, which marks 50 years since the pivotal environment gathering in the Swedish capital in 1972. It argues that although all the ingredients for change exist - from growing public support for structural change to accelerating clean technology - there has been a stark lack of action. It says transformative change can happen by making sustainable lifestyles the easy and preferred choice for people and communities and by promoting business models that focus on services delivered, not products made. 'The ample opportunities for policymakers to take action and the growing momentum for change gives me hope,' said Nina Weitz, from SEI. 'We see how public opinion reflects the urgency and willingness to change lifestyles, how youth worldwide demand and exercise more agency to fight climate change, environmental degradation and inequity and that technological development and uptake is occurring faster than anticipated.' The report's recommendations include: The report calls for improved co-ordination between states to tackle ecological and other crisis and stronger accountability for those failing to act. 'Countries, companies and citizens have to be held accountable for their actions and their inaction,' it states. 'We need new imaginative mechanisms for nurturing constructive accountability, which incentivises and leads to bold action and change.' The 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment established a framework for action and set a global agenda for humans and the environment, with heads of state committing to protect and promote human and environmental health and well-being. Organisers say next month's Stockholm 50 conference aims to act as a springboard for the UN's 'decade of action' and help deliver on pledges made on climate change, biodiversity and the adoption of green post-Covid-19 recovery plans.", "cbe01f94aab33e51dd0a17f66aa48de1b82bdb341d67ffa7c3feee9c": "Authorities in Dallas said on Tuesday the man suspected of opening fire in a hair salon in the city's Koreatown and wounding three women of Asian descent harbored delusions about Asian people since having a car crash involving an Asian man two years ago. Police identified the gunman as Jeremy Smith, 36, and said he has been charged with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon. Smith was booked early on Tuesday is being held in Dallas county jail. The shooting is being investigated as a hate crime by the FBI along with the US attorney's office for the northern district of Texas and the civil rights division of the US Department of Justice. Dallas police earlier arrested Smith in connection with the shooting , and federal officials are investigating the attack as a hate crime. Dallas police chief Eddie Garcia has said the shooting at Hair World Salon could be connected to two other shootings at businesses run by Asian Americans. The shooting in Dallas occurred a few days before a white gunman killed 10 Black people on Saturday at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, and a gunman authorities said was motivated by political hatred against Taiwan killed one person and wounded five on Sunday at a southern California church where mostly elderly Taiwanese parishioners had gathered. Authorities have said a man dressed all in black opened fire at the Dallas salon, then drove off in a maroon minivan. Garcia said investigators found that a similar vehicle was reported to be involved in two other recent shootings, including a drive-by on 2 April in the area where the salon is located. No one was injured in either of those shootings. Garcia said the vehicle was also linked to a drive-by shooting on 10 May about 25 miles south-east of the shopping center where Wednesday's shooting happened. The three women who were shot at the salon were taken to a hospital with injuries that weren't life-threatening. Jane Bae, the daughter of one of the wounded women, told the Associated Press last week that her mother told her that the mystery shooter was calm.  'He was calm. He just walked up to it and then stood there - didn't walk around - but stood there and shot like 20 shots and then just calmly went out,' said Bae, who wasn't there but had spoken with her mother. The salon is in the heart of Koreatown, which transformed in the 1980s from an industrial area to a thriving district with shopping, dining, markets, medical offices and salons. Anti-Asian violence has risen sharply in recent years. Last year, six women of Asian descent were among the eight killed in a shooting at massage businesses in and near Atlanta, heightening anger and fear among Asian Americans. And the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, announced hate crime charges relating to assaults by a suspect against seven Asian American women in New York City in February.", "6c4d886caff89da8c8ea4e7f6a5afc8a490d35ee97fd06a4f867a293": "The US Department of Justice on Tuesday sued Steve Wynn, the billionaire former casino mogul and senior Republican fund raiser, to compel him to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act as an agent of China. The department said Wynn, 80, had contacted then-US president Donald Trump and members of his Republican administration in 2017 to convey China's request to cancel the visa of or otherwise remove a Chinese businessperson who had sought political asylum in the United States. In a statement the Department of Justice said it was seeking to compel Wynn to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (Fara) as the agent of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and a senior official of the PRC's Ministry of Public Security (MPS). 'The filing of this suit - the first affirmative civil lawsuit under Fara in more than three decades - demonstrates the department's commitment to ensuring transparency in our democratic system,' said assistant attorney general Matthew Olsen of the justice department's national security division. 'Where a foreign government uses an American as its agent to influence policy decisions in the United States, Fara gives the American people a right to know.' According to the complaint, in June and August 2017 Wynn contacted Trump and members of his administration to 'convey the PRC's request to cancel the visa or otherwise remove from the United States a Chinese businessperson who left China in 2014, was later charged with corruption by the PRC and sought political asylum in the United States'. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that the person was Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, who has been accused by the Chinese authorities of a range of criminal offenses including bribery and sexual assault, charges he has denied. Guo has said he is the subject of a witch hunt after accusing senior PRC figures of having corrupt ties with China's business leaders. The complaint alleges that Wynn engaged in these efforts at the request of Sun Lijun, then-vice minister of the MPS. 'Wynn conveyed the request directly to the then-president over dinner and by phone, and he had multiple discussions with the then-president and senior officials at the White House and National Security Council about organizing a meeting with Sun and other PRC government officials,' according to the justice department. Wynn's company owned and operated casinos in Macau, a special administrative region in the PRC and the department alleges that 'Wynn acted at the request of the PRC out of a desire to protect his business interests in Macau'. Wynn's lawyers denied the charges. 'Steve Wynn has never acted as an agent of the Chinese government and had no obligation to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. We respectfully disagree with the Department of Justice's legal interpretation of Fara and look forward to proving our case in court,' said a statement from his attorneys, Reid Weingarten and Brian Heberlig. In 2018, Wynn resigned as finance chair of the Republican National Committee, a day after it was reported that he faced multiple of allegations of sexual misconduct. Days later he resigned from his luxury casino and hotel company, Wynn Resorts. He denied the allegations of sexual harassment and assault. In 2020, Elliott Broidy, a venture capitalist and former deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Congress, pleaded guilty of acting as an unregistered foreign agent, accepting millions of dollars to lobby the Trump administration for Malaysian and Chinese interests. Broidy admitted to working with Chinese officials attempting to return Guo to his home country. The complaint alleges Wynn was drawn into the lobbying effort by Broidy. Broidy was later pardoned by Trump.

The video appears to show a police officer attempting to remove a handcuffed bus driver from his bus in Labasa on Vanua Levu, Fiji's second largest island on Monday. In the video, which was shared thousands of times and prompted hundreds of comments condemning the apparent conduct, a policeman is seen shouting and pointing at the bus driver, before the officer wraps his hands around the man's neck and appears to slam his head against the seat several times. Police told local media that an officer had been suspended based on initial findings of an investigation conducted by the Internal Affairs Unit and would be on leave while an investigation was completed. They also said the bus driver had been charged with one count of failure to give his name and address and one count of serious assault, with allegations the driver assaulted the police officer during the execution of his duties. The bus driver will appear in the Labasa magistrates court on Tuesday. Police did not respond to the Guardian's request for comment. In the video, passengers on board the bus are heard telling the officer: 'You can't do that.' At one point, the police officer turns to a person on the bus, saying 'I know my job.' Another voice can be heard on the video telling the bus driver: 'Excuse me, I am a member of parliament. You cannot do that.' Lenora Qereqeretabua, an MP from the National Federation Party, has identified herself as the MP on the video. She posted an account of the incident on her Twitter page, saying she was travelling to Savusavu - an hour 20 minutes out from Labasa - when she 'witnessed a commotion'. 'I decided to intervene and got into the bus saying to the police officer, 'Excuse me, you can't do that, what's he done? What's your [regimental] number? You can deal with this without violence,' Qereqeretabua posted on Twitter. 'The poor driver said the police officer had his hand on his neck and the passengers who had been protesting backed the driver up. All the while the officer was tugging at the driver's arm.' According to Qereqeretabua, the driver left with the officer and she rang the bus company's owner to inform what had occurred. 'Non-violent conflict resolution is something all of us need to learn from school,' she said, adding 'those tasked with enforcing whilst upholding the law must learn that there is always a calm way to approach a problem without making it worse.' She says she will 'be a witness if it's necessary.' The Fiji Bus Operators Association (FBOA) has condemned the incident and is calling on the Fiji Police leadership 'to take appropriate action' against the officer. Zane Dean, acting president of FBOA, says the incident 'demonstrates the lack of understanding of some police officers about their role and the limits to their powers.' Last month, Sitiveni Qiliho, the commissioner of police, announced that a human rights division would be set up within the police force to investigate human rights complaints by its officers. Police brutality cases are not uncommon in Fiji. Figures from Fiji's director of public prosecution obtained by the Guardian at the end of 2020 show that 400 charges of serious violence were laid against police officers between May 2015 and April 2020. Last year, Rusiate Tudravu, former acting commissioner of police told FBC he had received numerous complaints of alleged police brutality, causing a loss of public trust in police. Fiji will head to the polls this year and Sitiveni Rabuka, former prime minister and military general, and now the leader of the People's Alliance Party is challenging sitting prime minister Frank Bainimarama for the top job.

Over at Fox News, however, there was barely any mention of the white gunman's alleged reasoning for opening fire at a supermarket, killing 10 people and wounding three more, in a predominantly Black area. The absence of coverage of the motive was revealing, given Fox News's most popular host, Tucker Carlson, has pushed the concept of replacement theory in more than 400 of his shows - and has arguably done more than anyone in the US to popularize the racist conspiracy. Fox News, according to Oliver Darcy, a media correspondent for CNN, 'largely ignored' the fact that the shooter had been inspired by replacement theory. Darcy searched transcripts from Fox News's shows, and found one brief mention, by Fox News anchor Eric Shawn. As Americans absorbed news of the shooting and struggled to understand why it had happened, it seemed a glaring omission. But given Carlson and his colleagues' promotion of the theory, which has been unchecked by Fox News's top executives, experts see the network as being left in a bind. 'What can they say?' said Matt Gertz, senior fellow at Media Matters for America, a watchdog of rightwing media. 'There's no way for anyone at Fox News to really issue a convincing and compelling, forthright denunciation of great replacement theory, because it's being discussed on the network's primetime hour on a near constant basis.' Great replacement theory, or white replacement theory, states that a range of liberals, Democrats and Jewish people are working to replace white voters in western countries with non-white people, in an effort to achieve political aims. It is not a new concept. But Carlson has led the charge in reintroducing it to mainstream rightwing thought. In April a New York Times investigation found that in more than 400 hundred of his shows Carlson had advanced the idea that a 'cabal of elites want to force demographic change through immigration'. In a monologue on his Monday night show, Carlson did not directly address replacement theory. He claimed the Buffalo shooter's manifesto was 'not recognizably leftwing or rightwing: it's not really political at all', despite the rambling document referencing a number of rightwing conspiracy theories. Carlson referred to the gunman as 'mentally ill' and launched an attack on 'professional Democrats' who had 'begun a campaign to blame those murders on their political opponents'. In April 2021, after Carlson claimed on his show that Democrats were 'diluting' his vote by 'importing a brand-new electorate', the Anti-Defamation League wrote to Fox News to sound the alarm. 'Make no mistake: this is dangerous stuff. The 'great replacement theory' is a classic white supremacist trope that undergirds the modern white supremacist movement in America,' wrote Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the ADL. 'It is a concept that is discussed almost daily in online racist fever swamps. It is a notion that fueled the hateful chants of 'Jews will not replace us!' in Charlottesville in 2017. And it has lit the fuse in explosive hate crimes, most notably the hate-motivated mass shooting attacks in Pittsburgh, Poway and El Paso, as well as in Christchurch, New Zealand.' The ADL called for Carlson to be fired for his comments, but instead the rightwing host - whose show is the most-watched on cable news - has thrived, and his passion for the topic of replacement has spread to his colleagues. But Carlson is not alone on Fox. Laura Ingraham, who hosts an hour-long show at 10pm, has told her viewers that Democrats 'want to replace you, the American voters, with newly amnestied citizens and an ever increasing number of chain migrants', while Jeanine Pirro claimed on a radio show that liberals were engaged in 'a plot to remake America, to replace American citizens with illegals who will vote for the Democrats'. '  To be clear, Fox News is far from the only place where you might hear such dangerous rhetoric,' wrote Tom Jones, a senior media writer at the Poynter institute. '[But] the size of Fox News's audience is what is notable. Fox News is the most-watched cable news network, and Carlson's show is the most-watched on cable news, routinely drawing more than 3 million viewers a night.' Fox News declined to comment when asked if it planned to condemn the idea of white replacement or take action against Carlson. A spokeswoman pointed to examples of Carlson denouncing violence on his show. Fox News was one of six media organizations which the gunman claimed, in his manifesto, were disproportionately influenced by Jewish people. The network's popularity has given it an outsized influence over the Republican party, an influence and relationship that was revealed recently when leaked text messages from the phone of Mark Meadows, Donald Trump's former White House chief-of-staff, showed Meadows in frequent communication with Fox News hosts as supporters of Trump besieged the US Capitol on 6 January. It should perhaps be little surprise, then, that Trump-supporting Republican politicians like Elise Stefanik and JD Vance have also embraced replacement theory. 'It's been gradually moving from the fringes into the mainstream,' Philip Gorski, a professor of sociology at Yale, told the Washington Post. 'First it was the entertainment wing of the GOP. Now it's the political wing as well.' The Buffalo shooter did not mention Fox News as an influence on his political beliefs, but said he had been radicalized through the extremist online forum 4chan, where he had found 'infographics, shitposts, and memes that the White race is dying out'. From there, the gunman said, he had discovered sources including the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer. Curiously, the founder of the Daily Stormer, Andrew Anglin, has called Tucker Carlson 'literally our greatest ally', and praised the Fox News host in 2021, in the wake of his replacement theory comments. '[Carlson was] dropping the ultimate truth bomb on his audience: Jews aggressively lobby for the same demographic policies in America that they openly declare would destroy their own country,' Anglin wrote. Since the shooting Carlson and his fellow Fox News hosts have justifiably drawn criticism for their promotion of replacement theory. But Gertz said the problem ultimately runs deeper, all the way to the Murdoch family, which controls the channel. 'Everyone knows the score here,' Gertz said. 'Tucker Carlson is doing his job. He is providing the content that the Fox News brass, the Murdochs, want out of their 8pm slot. 'If they didn't want him to do this, they could make him stop - but they've decided not to. And they have decided not to do that because he is still profitable for them.'", "34aca4f4241157a6be96540def3c6403bedd620323c82afe95666c2b": "", "7c00ad5f1a68c016112d342526ba5766b534b536cd1cc8435c6820ba": "", "417203d019d10a0fb5e2447c0fddcaac22b8f6cc30c8017e83f649ad": "", "56d9b2bee5ae38c89436cad65f640455fd2d9a7e90f97a3ee2e851f6": "", "285e3dbccf2ee0cca8b502383a195694f1d647b8bc6a7ad49e9a87bd": "", "8aa470d2c596b513a51815c73afd2e91c7cdcdad5ebaf467728c3f90": "", "0d4396e44956ea1c404f68bbc9f9ef36515036b5dba79283de12b510": "In July 2003, the physicist and Pulitzer-prize-nominated author Dr Tony Rothman received an email from his editor bearing unwelcome news. Rothman's new book was weeks from publication. An affable debunking of widely misunderstood stories from the history of science, the title, Everything's Relative, was a playful nod to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. Rothman had asked his publisher, Wiley, to put a picture of history's most famous scientist on the cover. 'An issue just came up,' the email read. Rothman's editor had been warned that Einstein's estate is 'extremely aggressive and litigious'. Unless the publisher paid a hefty fee to use the image of Einstein, the editor explained, they could be sued. Rothman was dismayed. 'I think this is ridiculous,' he replied via email. 'If the estate went after everybody who used [Einstein's image], they'd have no time on their hands for anything else. Are you sure they even own it?' Rothman's editor was unwilling to investigate the legal technicalities. It was not the first time the publisher had encountered hostile heirs, he said, referring darkly to 'the slavering jackals' who run the literary estate of one iconic 20th-century American writer. Albert Einstein died in 1955. In article 13 of his last will and testament, he pledged that his 'manuscripts, copyrights, publication rights, royalties ... and all other literary property' would, upon the deaths of his secretary, Helen Dukas, and stepdaughter, Margot Einstein, pass to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, an institution that Einstein cofounded in 1918. Einstein made no mention in his will about the use of his name or likeness on books, products or advertisements. Today, these are known as publicity rights, but at the time Einstein was writing his will, no such legal concept existed. When the Hebrew University took control of Einstein's estate in 1982, however, publicity rights had become a fierce legal battleground, worth millions of dollars each year. In the mid-1980s, the university began to assert control over who could use Einstein's name and likeness, and at what cost. Potential licensors were told to submit proposals, which would then be assessed by unnamed arbitrators behind closed doors. An Einstein-branded diaper? No. An Einstein-branded calculator? Yes. Anyone who did not follow this process, or defied the university's decision, could be subject to legal action. Sellers of Einstein-themed T-shirts, Halloween costumes, coffee beans, SUV trucks and cosmetics found themselves in court. The university's targets ranged from hawkers of market-stall novelties to multinationals such as Coca-Cola, Apple and the Walt Disney Company, which in 2005 paid $2.66m for a 50-year licence to use the name 'Baby Einstein' on its line of infant toys. Einstein had been a well-paid man. His Princeton salary of $10,000 - roughly $180,000 in today's money - was set by the university to exceed that of any American scientist ('Isn't that too much?' Einstein queried at the time). But his earnings in life were insignificant compared to his earnings in death. From 2006 to 2017, he featured every year in Forbes' list of the 10 highest-earning historic figures - 'dead celebrities' in the publication's rather diminishing term - bringing in an average of $12.5m a year in licensing fees for the Hebrew University, which is the top-ranking university in Israel. A conservative estimate puts Einstein's postmortem earnings for the university to date at $250m. Despite the university's repeated successes in taking on alleged infringers, critics remain unconvinced that Einstein would have wanted any of this. In life, he resisted attempts to commercialise his identity. Why would he have changed this position in death? One American law professor, writing in the New York Times, described the institution and others like it as 'the new grave robbers'. A lawyer for Time Inc called agents acting for the university a 'group of tribal headhunters'. The manufacturer of a children's novelty Einstein costume is among the scores of businesses to have protested against the university's position, telling a reporter, '[The university] cannot 'inherit' rights from Albert Einstein which did not exist at the time of his death.' The university, meanwhile, claims it has not only the legal right, but also a moral duty to protect Einstein from those who would besmirch his name with dubious associations. Beyond this, it is not keen to discuss the matter. The university rejected my request for an interview for this article, but agreed to reply to email questions via an intermediary. Its responses were terse. To factual questions, it largely answered 'not known'. To other questions, it restated that it is entitled to enforce its legal rights and does not wish to disclose further details. The matter is far from settled. Prof Roger Schechter from George Washington University Law School describes the law around postmortem publicity rights as 'a complete mess'. While Brazil, Canada, France, Germany and Mexico have national laws that specify the definition and duration of postmortem publicity rights, in the US the law varies between states. Only 24 states have adopted a formal statute on postmortem publicity rights, which can last anywhere from 20 years after a person's death (Virginia) to 100 (Oklahoma, Indiana). A celebrity who dies in California therefore has different rights to one who dies in New York. New Jersey, where Einstein died, is one of 17 US states that has placed no limitation on the right of an heir to profit from a dead celebrity's publicity rights - which could allow the Hebrew University to bring legal action against alleged infringers indefinitely. 'If I were looking for a problem to put on a final law exam that would put my students through their paces,' Schechter told me, 'Einstein would be it.' While lawyers debate obscurities of law, the Hebrew University continues to profit from Einstein's name, likeness - even his silhouette. Last year the British government paid an undisclosed sum to use Einstein to front a nationwide TV and online advertising campaign for smart energy meters. The university is currently embroiled in a case it has brought against 100 alleged infringers of its Einstein trademarks in the state of Illinois, where a statute protects everything from a celebrity's likeness to their 'gestures and mannerisms' for 100 years. Back in 2003, Rothman was unconvinced by his publisher's claim that the university had the power to ban Einstein from the cover of his book. How could any organisation - let alone an institution dedicated to learning - claim ownership of a public figure's image in such a way? His publisher, however, was unwilling to risk a costly legal battle. Rothman received a mock-up of the cover. Einstein was gone, replaced by Thomas Edison. 'The design sucks,' Rothman wrote to his editor, before adding in a follow-up email, 'I demand that you go back to the original.' The publisher's position remained firm. The university's reputation was enough to dissuade them. When Everything's Relative finally appeared in bookshops, the cover showed a puff of clouds that spelled out the world's most famous formula, E=mc2. The equation's author was nowhere to be seen. Einstein understood the power of images. Throughout his life he conjured simple scenes to illustrate complex ideas: a plummeting elevator, a train speeding through a lightning storm, a blind beetle creeping along a curved surface. To explain his special theory of relativity he would joke: 'A minute sitting on a hot stove seems like an hour, but an hour sitting with a pretty girl passes like a minute.' In time, he too would become a symbol, the purest embodiment of that enigmatic quality: genius. As a baby, however, Einstein lacked promise. On seeing the infant's lopsided head for the first time in 1879, his maternal grandmother exclaimed: 'Much too fat! Much too fat!' The family maid dubbed the boy 'der Depperte' - the dope. Einstein took so long to learn to talk that his parents made an appointment with the doctor to find out if there was something wrong with him. One schoolmaster declared that his most distracted pupil would never amount to anything. After Einstein graduated from the Zurich Polytechnic with a diploma in mathematics, he was rejected for several junior academic jobs. While working at the Bern patent office as a clerk - or, in his words, a 'respectable federal ink pisser' - he developed scientific theories and in 1905, at 26, began to publish a series of papers that would revolutionise physics, including the special theory of relativity. Other scientists quickly grasped the significance of Einstein's ideas and in 1909 he became professor of theoretical physics at Zurich University. It wasn't until 1919, however, that Einstein became world famous. That year, during a solar eclipse, the English astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington conducted a photographic experiment designed to evaluate one of Einstein's theories: that gravity bends light over distance, a simple assertion with galaxy-rearranging implications. If true, the position of every star, moon and planet would have to be recalculated. Einstein was not well known in Britain, where scientists took pleasure in ignoring or denigrating their German counterparts. Still, the great and the good came to the Royal Society of London on 6 November 1919, to hear the results of Eddington's experiments. The next morning's edition of the Times delivered the news to the world: 'Revolution in Science. New Theory of the Universe. Newtonian Ideas Overthrown.' The New York Times declared Einstein's discovery 'perhaps the greatest achievement in the history of human thought'. 'Lights all askew in the heavens,' read one headline. The dope had knocked the world from its axis. Reborn as a public figure in this, the first flowering of mass media, Einstein began to receive torrents of fan mail. 'I'm burning in Hell and the postman is the devil,' he wrote four weeks after Eddington's presentation, complaining that he was so hounded by the press that he could 'barely breathe'. Still, Einstein continued to give interviews, where his easy wit and talent for aphorism made for good copy. He wrote editorials for national newspapers and kept glittering company. He had a kind of undefinable charisma. 'Einstein's personality, for no clear reason, triggers outbursts of a kind of mass hysteria,' wrote a bewildered German consul in New York in 1931. His intellect made Einstein famous, but it was his appearance that made him an icon. Few understood the implications of his work - '4,000 bewildered as Einstein speaks,' wrote the New York Times - but his image, spread via the accelerating technologies of print and television, was eminently approachable. The frazzled hair, the frowsy jumper, the caterpillar moustache, the hangdog jowls and those sad, galactic eyes. 'He was slovenly,' Robert Schulmann, a former editor of the Collected Papers of Einstein told me. 'And at some point, it began to work in his favour.' Einstein's image endeared him to the world, suggesting that here was a mind too occupied with higher questions to spare much thought to, say, a comb. Einstein's work as a humanitarian, philosopher, pacifist and anti-racist continued throughout his life. After Adolf Hitler came to power, the emigre Einstein renounced his German citizenship and never returned to his homeland. (His summer house in Caputh, Brandenburg was used by the Hitler Youth.) He worked to help refugees escape Nazi oppression, campaigned for the civil rights of black Americans and, after his theories helped build the atomic bomb, became a vociferous pacifist. Today Einstein's fingerprints can be found on many of the technologies that make the modern world work, from lasers to the semi-conductors that power your smartphone. But in the public eye at least, it is Einstein's image that has most conspicuously endured. On 14 March 1951, as Einstein left the Princeton Club in New Jersey, where he had been celebrating his 72nd birthday, he caught sight of a camera held by the American photojournalist Arthur Sasse. Einstein looked down the lens and poked out his tongue. When Sasse sent the image to his editors, they debated whether to publish, fearing the image caught a distinguished subject in a moment of lapsed judgment. In fact, on publication, the picture provided the most famous and enduring image of the scientist: a loveable joker who also happened to be an era-defining genius. Einstein ordered nine copies. Einstein died four years later, on 18 April 1955, at the age of 76. He had made plans to prevent posthumous idolatry, leaving instructions with his trusted friend and executor of his estate, the economist Otto Nathan. Einstein wanted his body to be cremated and the ashes scattered over the Delaware river on the Atlantic coast. There would be no shrine; his work alone would be his legacy. This did not prevent the theft of his brain, which was extracted and preserved by Thomas Harvey, chief pathologist at the hospital where Einstein died. ('My dad's got his brain,' Harvey's son, Arthur, told his classmates, the next morning.) Harvey hoped to keep for study the most impressive organ humanity had yet produced. In terms of future dividends, however, Harvey picked the wrong relic. It was not Einstein's brain the world wanted; it was his face. Whenever he walked into the living room of his parents' house in the town of Washington, New York, Roger Richman saw a framed photograph of Albert Einstein standing with his father. Richman's father, Paul, had befriended Einstein in the 1930s when they worked together to help German Jews resettle in Alaska, Paraguay and Mexico. (At the time, most of the US was closed to those fleeing Nazi oppression.) Richman's father died in 1955, three months after Einstein, but the Richman family remained close to the keepers of Einstein's legacy. Richman became a lawyer, and in 1978 founded an agency that specialised in product placement in film and TV. The following year, the heirs of the late American comedian WC Fields contacted his office. They wanted Richman to become his agent - a surprising request, given that Fields had been dead for 32 years. Fields' heirs hoped Richman could ban the sale of a poster that showed the comedian's head superimposed on a body clothed only in a nappy. There seemed to be little legal recourse: a celebrity's publicity rights did not extend in law to heirs. While researching the law, Richman found a case involving the son of Bela Lugosi, the Hungarian-American actor best remembered for his performance as Dracula. In 1966, Lugosi's son sued Universal Pictures, claiming that he and his stepmother owned his father's image rights, not the movie studio. Lugosi's son won the case at trial, but the high court overturned the ruling on the grounds that his father had not sold his image for commercial purposes during his lifetime. Richman deduced, then, the heirs of any celebrity who had sold his or her image during their lifetime had a claim on their publicity rights. An opportunity to test his theory came a few months later, when Richman learned the US Postal Service planned to produce a commemorative stamp in honour of WC Fields' 100th birthday. He lodged a complaint, mentioning the high court's judgment in the case of Lugosi. After initial protestation, the Postal Service paid its first licence fee to the estate of a dead celebrity. Richman soon built an enviable roster of deceased clients, which included Marilyn Monroe and Sigmund Freud. Descendants of late celebrities were often pleased to hear from Richman, who offered them a way to protect their loved ones from legacy-tainting associations and to make some money along the way. Advertisers, too, were eager to collaborate with the dead who, unlike the living, did not become embroiled in new scandals, fail to turn up for expensive photo shoots, or demand costly contract renegotiations. The recipients of Richman's legal letters, however, were sceptical. Companies used to abiding by established libel, copyright and trademark law found themselves 'ambushed by sketchy and unsettled legal claims', as Will Clark, the cofounder of Baby Einstein, told me. 'It was clear Richman had 'invented' an interesting legal concept that resonated in Hollywood. But it was equally clear he was pushing a big boulder up a steep hill.' Richman considered himself the underdog. 'Oftentimes I became despondent over the power and influence of the opposition,' he wrote in an unpublished memoir. 'I was fighting major advertising agencies, broadcasters, film studios, manufacturers and publishers - a belligerent field.' He was energised, however, by what he considered to be a moral cause. How could anyone, Richman wrote, 'not want to remove a presidential dildo from the marketplace?' To add legal heft to his threats, WC Fields' grandson, Everett, suggested that Richman draft a celebrity rights law. At first, Richman thought the idea preposterous. But when the California senator William Campbell expressed interest in drafting such a law, Richman wrote more than 80 letters to 'widows and orphans of celebrity greats', and amassed a group of powerful supporters, including Elizabeth Taylor, Elvis Presley's ex-wife Priscilla and Bing Crosby's widow Kathryn. After two rejections, the California Celebrity Rights Act passed on 1 January 1985. In California, at least, heirs could now legally inherit the publicity rights of their celebrity ancestors who had died in the state. With a legal precedent established in California, Richman was in business. It was time, he decided, to come to the rescue of his father's old friend, Albert Einstein. During his lifetime, Einstein had fought any attempts to use his name and likeness as a promotional gimmick. He even barred seemingly harmonious associations, such as Brandeis University's proposal that it be renamed Einstein University. In death, however, nobody seemed to care what Einstein had wanted. By the 1980s Einstein's likeness was attached to all manner of goods and services, lending everything from frisbees to snow globes a frisson of intellectual glamour. Now Einstein was unable to protest, almost every company in the world seemed both willing and able to profit from him. After the passage of the Celebrity Rights Act, Richman began to collect clippings of advertisements that featured Einstein. He sent a folder of this material - everything from ads for cars to ads for hair salons - to Einstein's executor, Otto Nathan, with a letter asking whom he should contact to, as he put it, 'prevent this kind of abuse'. Nathan forwarded the clippings to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Seeing an opportunity to exert some influence over the use of Einstein's likeness, on 1 July 1985, the university appointed Richman as Einstein's 'exclusive worldwide agent', as he described his role. The Princeton-based newspaper US1 had another name for Richman's function, later describing him as 'the Hebrew University's designated gorgon-watchdog'. The deal with the Hebrew University tilted in Richman's favour. He took a 65% cut from every licence deal, or 50/50 for the proceeds of successful legal actions against infringers. Where others perceived Richman as an opportunist, he considered his work a moral campaign to protect the legacy of the 20th century's defining icon. Richman drew up a set of guidelines, which the university agreed to: Einstein would not be associated with tobacco, alcohol or gambling. There was to be no fabrication of quotations or formulas. No advertiser could draw a thought bubble on to a picture of Einstein and seek to fill his mind with their words or ideas. 'Those were the basics,' wrote Richman. He claimed his personal connection to Einstein strengthened his resolve to only allow affiliations 'befitting a physicist, humanitarian, philosopher and pacifist'. Richman was a tireless seeker of Einstein contraband, so the university delegated the responsibility for dealing with the deluge of requests to a volunteer, Ehud Benamy from the American Friends of the Hebrew University in New York - an affiliate organisation established to raise university funds and awareness in the US. Richman sent every licensing proposal to Benamy, who rejected many requests. Benamy agreed with Richman's view that Sasse's famous photograph showing Einstein sticking out his tongue was 'in bad taste', and the pair decided they would reject the frequent requests they received from advertisers to use the image. (Several years later the Hebrew University conceded that it should not outright veto a pose Einstein had 'knowingly presented to the world'.) The pair refused to grant a licence to an Italian manufacturer of ovens, an association Richman believed may upset Jewish holocaust survivors. Computer manufacturers were especially eager to associate their products with Einstein. In 1989, Sony reluctantly paid $63,000 to use Einstein's image in an advertisement. In 1997, Richman received word that Apple wanted to use Einstein's photograph to advertise its Mac computers alongside the slogan 'Think different'. After Richman had negotiated what he believed to be a fair fee of $600,000 he received a call from Apple's cofounder, Steve Jobs, demanding a reduction. 'I explained that there was only one Albert Einstein,' Richman wrote in his memoirs. If the fee was too high, he said, Jobs could license Mae West instead: 'She thought different also.' Jobs paid up. Despite Richman's best efforts, some 'seriously offensive' products, as he saw them, reached the market. When Richman discovered that a chain of stores owned by Universal City Studios sold a sweatshirt with the slogan 'E=mc2: Shit Happens', he successfully had the sweatshirt banned, and forced Universal to pay $25,000 in damages. Richman later took umbrage at Command & Conquer, the video game series launched in 1995 by Electronic Arts, in which players could, in his words, 'click a few keys that result in Adolf Hitler killing Albert Einstein'. Richman wanted EA to add a sticker to each box warning of antisemitic content. EA counterclaimed that fictional writing about historical characters was a first amendment right that superseded the right of posthumous publicity. The parties settled out of court. Richman resented the fact that he was often depicted in court and the press as a 'marketing ghoul'. It was a hurtful portrayal, he wrote, 'especially since I had written laws preventing snakes to slither into everyone's life'. Richman considered it troubling, too, that as a Jewish entrepreneur he was routinely portrayed as an opportunistic money-grabber. It was indisputable, however, that Richman was committed to securing the Hebrew University - and himself - the most favourable terms. When Richman learned that the Baby Einstein company was in talks to sell to the Walt Disney company, he demanded the previously agreed upon licence fee be increased. (Will Clark, the cofounder of Baby Einstein, believes that the university publicised the final $2.66m licence figure to 'establish validity of licensing Einstein's name and paying a premium for it'.) Emboldened by success, Richman even began to target companies that used Einstein's name without any intended association with the physicist. The Einstein Bros Bagel company caved to the university's demands, despite being named after its own founders. For one academic at the Hebrew University, Richman's aggressive stance presented a troubling ethical dilemma. Throughout the 1990s, Ze'ev Rosenkranz, assistant curator at the Einstein Archives at the Hebrew University in Israel, received as many as 30 faxes a month from Richman's office in Beverley Hills. Each fax contained a proposal from a different company that hoped to use Einstein's name or likeness in its product or service: everything from antibiotics to computers, cameras to soft drinks. It was up to Rosenkranz, a young academic who, through his work preserving Einstein's papers, was intimately familiar with the scientist's thoughts and values, to bless or veto each offer. The responsibility was 'overwhelming', Rosenkranz told me recently. 'I am a historian, not a businessman. But somehow the universe had decided that this would be my role.' The task had fallen to Rosenkranz after Ehud Benamy died in late 1990. The academic deliberated over each request with a scholar's sense of duty, balancing his speculation as to what Einstein may have wanted with the pressure he felt from Richman to greenlight anything that did not carry an obviously harmful association. 'It was basically an issue of taste,' he recalled. 'Sometimes I didn't think the product in question, or its design, or the accompanying text were sufficiently 'lofty'.' Refusals would often be met with fury. 'Companies would say: 'This is all hogwash',' Rosenkranz said. ''These people are dead. They don't have rights.'' Others denied that their Einstein-themed product had any association with the physicist. 'There was a word processor called 'Einstein' that was popular in Israel at the time,' Rosenkranz told me. 'The company even used the word 'genius' in its marketing.' But the makers claimed that the Einstein software was named not after the physicist Albert but after the company's founder, Stuart. (According to Rosencrantz the argument worked, and the company never paid up.) The university seemed happy to keep a low profile while Richman fought its profitable battles. 'I didn't get the impression that people were at all aware of the university's role during this period,' Rosenkranz told me. 'But Richman had the reputation of being a tough cookie in the negotiations - which was in the university's interest.' Rosenkranz was uneasy about his role. He believed Einstein would have been against most, if not all, marketing associations. 'If it was purely commercial, he was usually against it,' he said. Yet Richman put pressure on him to approve a far wider range of proposals. Rosenkranz recalled that when he rejected a deal from Huggies diapers, Richman was particularly unhappy. 'It wasn't purely about profit for him,' recalled Rosenkranz. 'But in the end, it was a business. And I am in academia. It was not an easy topic.' Before he sold his agency and its roster of 'dead legends' to the photo agency Corbis in 2005, Richman persuaded the Hebrew University to file a slew of trademarks for Einstein-related products, which, he argued, would be easier to defend across legal jurisdictions according to established trademark laws. Soon the university held trademarks for 'Albert Einstein' on nearly 200 separate items, including metal detectors, umbrellas, arcade games, Christmas tree decorations, butterfly nets, water-squirting toys and life-size cardboard cutouts. For Rosenkranz, who continued to deliberate on licensing deals until he moved to southern California and resigned from his position at the university in 2003, the introduction of a trademark symbol was deeply uncomfortable. 'The first time I saw the little 'TM' above his name it really bothered me,' he said. 'There's no greater sign of commercialisation or commodification, is there? But [the lawyers] told me that, you know, this was all really important to guarantee the rights.' With international trademarks, the university could now litigate alleged infringements in countries where there was no posthumous right of publicity. Rosenkranz was not the only person to feel uneasy about the arrangement. In early 2011, when she was 70, Einstein's adoptive granddaughter, Evelyn, announced plans to sue the Hebrew University for what she considered to be a gross overreach of their role. What had started out as an act of curation had, in her view, evolved into a form of exploitation. 'I was really offended by some of the stuff that was being OKed,' Evelyn told a journalist from the New York Post. Evelyn's friend, the lawyer Allen Wilkinson, told me that 'she could not stand the fact that they were profiting from Einstein bobbleheads and other bits of memorabilia that have nothing to do with literary rights'. The university, Evelyn claimed, had ignored her requests for an arrangement that would allow her to profit from the sales to help pay her medical bills. Evelyn died before she had her day in court. But shortly after her death in April 2011, a case was heard in California that, it seemed, would settle the question of Albert Einstein's ownership for good. In November 2009, General Motors had placed an advertisement in People magazine that depicted Einstein's face pasted on to a muscled body, accompanied by the slogan: 'Ideas are sexy too.' The Hebrew University protested: 'Dr Einstein with his underpants on display ... causes injury to [the university's] carefully guarded rights in the image and likeness of the famous scientist.' On 16 March 2012, the Hebrew University took GM to court in an attempt to prove, definitively, that 'Albert Einstein would have transferred his postmortem right of publicity under New Jersey law had he been aware that such a right of publicity existed at the time of his death'. GM rejected this, arguing that, even if the university could prove both Einstein's intent with respect to the right of publicity and GM's violation of that right, enough time had elapsed between Einstein's death in 1955 to nullify the point. The trial was beset with complications. While the case was due to be heard in a California federal court, the presiding judge, Howard Matz, chose to apply New Jersey state law to the case - the jurisdiction in which Einstein had died. While California law protects a person's publicity rights for 70 years after their death, New Jersey does not stipulate any duration of such rights. It took seven months for Matz to reach the verdict. 'Einstein's persona has become thoroughly ingrained in our cultural heritage,' Matz wrote in his ruling. 'Now, nearly 60 years after his death, that persona should be freely available to those who seek to appropriate it as part of their own expression, even in tasteless ads.' 'Hebrew University loses lawsuit over Einstein image,' wrote the Times of Israel. But this seemingly conclusive verdict was far from clear cut. 'It's a curious case with an extremely unsatisfying resolution,' Prof Schechter from George Washington University Law School told me. 'You had a California judge guessing at a New Jersey law that doesn't strictly exist. Today no court would have to give this decision any weight whatsoever.' The university appealed the decision, and the case was sent back down to the lower court for further proceedings. Then the parties abruptly settled. 'If someone were to ask me what is the law in the state of New Jersey regarding the existence and duration of postmortem publicity rights? Well, we only have the best guess of an out-of-state federal judge in a vacated opinion,' Schechter said. 'It's not much to go on.' In the years since, there have been repeated calls for US Congress to step in and pass a uniform statute for the entire country. 'Until they do, it's highly variable,' said Schechter. Outside of the US, the law is equally uneven. In Brazil, posthumous rights persist for as long as there are living heirs. In Germany, the period is 70 years. In England and Wales, by contrast, there is no clear right of publicity at all. Lawyers seeking to protect an individual's image and personality must instead resort to what one firm describes as 'a patchwork of legal rights'. After Richman died in 2013, Corbis, the photo agency to whom he had sold Einstein's publicity rights, was rebranded as GreenLight Rights, which manages not only Einstein's rights but also those of Elvis Presley, Charlie Chaplin and Marilyn Monroe. Since then, the business of managing Einstein's image has become more sophisticated. GreenLight collaborates with companies that use special software to identify counterfeit and infringing merchandise online. Licence requests are no longer sent to a solitary academic in Israel, but to a panel of experts at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with the power to bless or veto. (The panel considers commercial requests. Media outlets such as the Guardian can use photographs of Einstein to illustrate stories like this one via existing deals the university has in place with photo libraries such as Getty.) Each application is considered on its own merits, but, following Richman's original guidelines, speech bubbles, which could enable a company to put words in Einstein's mouth, are always turned down, Yishai Fraenkel, vice president and CEO of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem told me, over email, via a GreenLight representative. The university declined to state how often the experts meet to deliberate, or to identify who sits on the panel, stating, 'It does not seem appropriate or lawful to include names of individuals.' Six decades after his death, Einstein's earnings show no sign of slowing. That Einstein remains so in demand is a function not just of his otherworldly brilliance and unforgettable appearance, but also the values he embodied. It has always been easy for diverse groups to embrace Einstein - a short, dyslexic hypochondriac from a persecuted minority - as their own. His seemingly contradictory positions - he opposed the creation of a Jewish state and deplored the victimisation of Palestinian Arabs, while raising funds for Zionist causes; he disdained the idea of divine revelation, but believed in God - made it possible even for opposed groups to adopt him as their figurehead. What would Einstein have made of his presence on the television screens, billboards, posters and T-shirts of the 21st century? Would he have been happy with the Hebrew University's stewardship of his legacy? In life, he often felt seen but not heard. 'It is strange to be known so universally and yet to be so lonely,' he once said. When I spoke to Rosenkranz - a man who spent 12 years attempting to determine what Einstein may have thought about Einstein-branded pencils and Einstein-branded Christmas tree decorations - he proposed several scenarios. 'He might have been happy that the university was profiting from [his likeness] financially,' he said. 'Part of him, the macho, bravado side would have just reacted to it with the shoulder shrug.' But, finally, Rosenkranz concluded, 'it probably would have bothered him. No, I'm not sure if he would have been happy.' Whatever the dead man's wishes, the question of who owns Albert Einstein, and for how long, remains unsettled. In late 2020, a Washington-based colleague told Schechter that he was working with the New Jersey legislature on an effort to draft and enact a right-of-publicity statute to specify the duration of posthumous publicity rights for people who died there. Schechter agreed to testify before the state legislature. Then, three months later, the pandemic struck and the statute was placed on hold. Richman always aligned the duration of postmortem publicity rights with that of copyright law: 70 years after death. If New Jersey were to resurrect the statute and adopt this relatively generous postmortem right, 'we could be fighting a battle', Schechter said, 'over what might be only two more years of Einstein licensing before they expire in 2025.' In the meantime, the Einstein money continues to roll in - while the university's reputation continues to have a powerful deterrent effect. A former curator at one of London's most famous museums told me that he had removed Einstein's image from publicity materials on the advice of a colleague. In advance of this article's publication, a spokeswoman for the university warned: 'To the extent that the article interferes with [our] commercial agreements, good name, or that of Dr Albert Einstein, [the University] will be prepared to defend its rights.' Not long ago, to simplify the process and assuage such fears, GreenLight Rights launched a website where would-be licensees can apply to use Einstein's name, likeness or quotations. Applications are filtered and passed on to the Hebrew University's mysterious Einstein panel to make the ultimate decision. The name of the site is straightforward: Einstein.biz ", "14aef46148e7c72bcb8bdb6dbd0f698f0b604dce4dc19736785b7417": "The European Commission has raised the spectre of an economically damaging trade war with the UK, pledging to respond with 'all measures at its disposal' if Liz Truss presses ahead with a plan to rewrite the Northern Ireland protocol. The foreign secretary set out plans on Tuesday to table a bill that would make key changes to the protocol, including waiving all checks on goods flowing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland where they are not destined for the Republic of Ireland. She said the UK government still hoped to agree the changes it believes are necessary, calling these 'comprehensive and reasonable'. 'Our preference is to reach a negotiated outcome with the EU. We have worked tirelessly to that end and will continue to do so,' she said. But she claimed the protocol in its current form jeopardised the stability of the Good Friday agreement, which she said was 'under strain', and the government would act unilaterally if necessary. 'To respond to the very grave and serious situation in Northern Ireland we are clear that there is a necessity to act to ensure the institutions can be restored as soon as possible,' Truss said. Part of the government's motivation is to placate the Democratic Unionist party, which is refusing to enter a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein at Stormont unless the protocol is altered. The DUP's Westminster leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, said Truss's statement was 'a welcome if overdue step that is a significant move towards addressing the problems created by the protocol, and getting power-sharing, based upon a cross-community consensus, up and running again.' His party would like to see progress on the legislation 'in days and weeks, not months,' he said. Truss called for the EU's top official in charge of UK relations, Maros Sefcovic, to be given a rewritten negotiating mandate that would allow the protocol to be revised. However, Sefcovic responded to Truss's statement by issuing a veiled warning that the UK could lose its free trade arrangements with the EU if it went ahead. Sefcovic, a European Commission vice-president who has been leading talks on changes to the protocol, said Truss's proposals raised 'significant concerns', adding: 'Unilateral actions contradicting an international agreement are not acceptable.' 'Should the UK decide to move ahead with a bill disapplying constitutive elements of the protocol as announced today by the UK government, the EU will need to respond with all measures at its disposal,' he said in a statement. The EU could hit UK goods with tariffs within seven days of legal action or freeze the entire trade deal agreed with Boris Johnson in 2020, two of three immediate weapons at its disposal, according to Catherine Barnard, an EU law professor at the University of Cambridge. Legal action against the UK that was frozen as a goodwill gesture last year would probably be restarted. Truss said the new legislation would be published within weeks, including plans to create a 'green channel' allowing goods to be exported from Great Britain to Northern Ireland without checks as long as they are not destined for the Republic of Ireland. She said this would create a 'dual regulatory system that encompasses either EU or UK regulation as those businesses choose; that reflects its unique status of having a close relationship with the EU, while being part of the UK single market'. The legislation would also let the UK determine tax and spending in Northern Ireland. Truss pointed to the chancellor's recent decision to cut VAT on green energy installations, which she said he was unable to implement in Northern Ireland. Brussels sources say no decisions have been taken about how to respond if Truss does legislate and expressed hope the UK would return to the negotiating table to discuss changes proposed by the EU. It was suggested that if the government tabled a bill, Brussels would issue a formal warning and launch a process to decide on retaliatory measures. EU insiders believe the UK has never seriously engaged with what they see as far-reaching proposals to lighten customs and administrative checks made by Sefcovic last October. However, Truss dismissed these in the Commons. 'Their current proposals are not able to address the fundamental concerns. In fact it is our assessment that they would go backward from the situation we have today with the standstill,' she said. EU sources also point out that a change in mandate would require unanimous signoff by all member states. They said there was no desire to change Sefcovic's mandate to enable wholesale changes to the protocol, a matter Truss described as a 'fundamental issue'. The senior EU diplomat poured cold water on this idea, saying: 'The EU doesn't have a mandate, the protocol is the mandate.' The resurgence of the Northern Ireland row with the UK is seen by the EU as an unwelcome distraction at a time when Ukraine is fighting off a Russian invasion. David McAllister, a German Christian Democrat MEP who chairs the European parliament's foreign affairs committee, said: 'If you look at what is happening in the middle of Europe, a fully fledged military invasion, a horrible, horrific war and we are discussing again and again issues in Northern Ireland, which I believe could be solved with a bit of goodwill in London.' Richard Neal, the influential chair of a US congressional committee who is heading to London and Brussels in the coming days in an attempt to head off further deterioration of Anglo-Irish relations, said: 'Northern Ireland shouldn't be held hostage in the political process, rather all parties must stay the course and continue to work together to find durable solutions.' Neal is leading a delegation of at least half a dozen US congressional representatives to Europe amid rising tension over the Northern Ireland protocol. His trip will take in London, Brussels, Dublin and Belfast.", "17e2ebad33eb1e623f75f07979882549e31236e3bfef64d18a8062bc": "", "6011793f716e5da541219216e7306ce071ed44468d164ebd890ff954": "", "a7a93fe656ed91b94f798e8741a946c9810116866ba0bb1dd5c6b7c3": "Failure to act on the promises made at the Glasgow Cop26 climate summit last year would be 'an act of monstrous self-harm', the UK's president of the conference will warn today in Glasgow. Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister who led the UK-hosted summit that ended with agreement to limit global heating to 1.5C, will say that Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and rising energy and food prices, have changed the global outlook drastically in the six months since. But responding to those changes by reneging on climate commitments would only result in worse damage, he will say. 'The current crises should increase, not diminish, our determination to deliver on what we agreed here at Cop26, and honour the Glasgow climate pact,' he is expected to say. '[World leaders must show that] though the world has changed, our resolve has not.' Sharma is returning to Glasgow on Monday to mark six months since Cop26 ended. Nearly 200 countries have agreed to develop new commitments this year to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with the 1.5C goal, which requires roughly halving carbon levels by 2030, according to scientific advice from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Though Cop26 made important progress - all the world's big economies have now committed to net-zero goals, compared with a handful before the UK took on its Cop26 role - it fell short of producing national plans, called nationally determined contributions (NDCs), that add up to the 2030 target. But countries agreed to return this year to the Cop27 conference in Egypt in November with strengthened commitments. Sharma urged countries to 'pick up the pace' and make fresh commitments in line with stark warnings from the IPCC in new reports published this spring, and after recent extreme weather such as the heatwaves that have struck India and Pakistan. 'The window of time we have to act is closing fast [and] we must urgently adapt and reduce emissions, because current targets are not enough,' he will warn. 'Every country must respond to the call to revisit and strengthen their NDCs, and they must do so in 2022. The Glasgow pact calls on countries to look again at their NDCs, not at some vague point in the future, but this year, in 2022,' he will say. Many climate experts have told the Guardian they are concerned that the war in Ukraine, soaring prices for energy and food, and governments responding by increasing fossil fuel production, are imperilling the Cop26 promises. The Guardian has also uncovered evidence of nearly 200 'carbon bombs' - oil, gas and coal mega-projects, proposed or under way - that would destroy any chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Experts have warned that the answer to these crises is to move much faster away from fossil fuels. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: 'I believe we have the chance to make this a historic turning point, towards a cleaner and more secure energy system.' Failure to cut emissions will result in some of the world's biggest cities running out of water, a report from the charity Christian Aid warned on Monday. London, Sydney, Beijing, Cairo, Cape Town and Phoenix are all in danger of running out of water as the climate crisis takes hold, according to the report, entitled Scorched Earth: the impact of drought on 10 world cities. Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, who studied the 2018 drought in Cape Town, warned: 'Changing rainfall and higher temperatures - the result of greenhouse gas emissions - are making drought more common and more severe in parts of the world. As we saw in Cape Town, this can add up to catastrophic water shortages even for some major cities.' Nushrat Rahman Chowdhury, co-author of the Christian Aid report, said: 'Drought is not new, but its intensity and frequency have increased over the last 30 years due to global warming. It is a real danger; it threatens lives and livelihoods of some of the poorest people in the world, who have done the least to cause the climate crisis.'", "7731be08f05d3993217b874c5e1a93e95b5af03b2e8bc6c4c8ac1bb4": "As a marine archaeologist, Mensun Bound headed the 2022 Antarctic expedition that discovered the wreck of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Endurance, more than a century after the legendary ship became trapped in ice and sank. Now he is warning that its protection cannot be guaranteed due to the combined threats of global heating and underwater robotic technology that could enable thefts from the historic site. He fears that ocean acidification and melting ice will take their toll on Endurance, with underwater robotic systems becoming so advanced that he can envisage them being programmed from afar to travel 'invisibly' beneath the ice of the Weddell Sea, where the Endurance lies at depth. Shackleton's vessel was discovered in March, making polar history in solving one of the great maritime mysteries. It is in such an astonishing state of preservation that details such as its bell and rudder can be seen clearly. But Bound fears for their survival: 'What if an observation class submersible had a manipulating arm tucked away beneath its bonnet? Would they be able to resist snatching the bell?' His warnings are sounded in an interview in the latest issue of Wreckwatch magazine, which focuses this month on ice wrecks.  Bound, director of exploration on the Endurance22 project for the Falklands Maritime Heritage trust, also headed the 2019 search, which was called off after an underwater vehicle became trapped beneath the ice. In Wreckwatch, he compares the environmental conditions on both expeditions, shocked by a dramatic deterioration: 'There was very little of the old, thick, gnarled, multi-year ice and there was hardly any of the muscularity or pressure experienced in 2019. This time it was mainly thin first-year ice, and we were never under serious threat of becoming ice-bound. Was this an aberration peculiar to 2022 or part of a trend?... If the trend continues, we won't be able to depend much longer on that hard carapace of perennial sea ice to protect the Endurance.' He adds: 'There's always been environmental change of one kind or another, but taking place over many thousands of years. What we're seeing now has all happened within my lifetime which, in the scheme of things, is no more than the flick of a penguin's tail. Although it looks serene and beautiful, Antarctica is a continent in pain; it's a continent poised for catastrophe.' Bound describes the 2022 expedition as a 'non-disturbance survey'. 'We took nothing, we touched nothing ... We were profoundly aware that what we had found was totemic, a 'monument' that has entered the very bloodstream of our nation.' Asked about wrecks that are often pillaged once found, he adds: 'Illegal incursion by rogue organisations worries me a lot. I worked through what is often described as the golden age of maritime archaeology ... The recent past doesn't always feel so golden ... one long fight against vandals, a race against time to save what I could before another wreck was looted out of existence.' Sean Kingsley, a marine archaeologist and Wreckwatch's editor, said: 'Mensun's global warming take is very powerful and timely. If we cannot protect a national gem 3,000 metres deep on the dark side of the earth, what can we preserve? Should we leave major sites like this where they are, to fall apart and be plundered? Or be brave enough to recover select parts? After all, ice wreck after ice wreck will come to light as global warming pinches.' The Endurance and ice wrecks are featured in Shackleton's Legacy, an exhibition at the Shipwreck Treasure Museum in Charlestown, Cornwall.

Analysis by US officials of the black box flight recorders found amid the wreckage suggests deliberate input from the cockpit forced the Boeing 737-800 plane into its catastrophic dive. The Wall Street Journal quoted an unnamed source who said: 'The plane did what it was told to do by someone in the cockpit.' The China Eastern plane was cruising at a steady altitude and speed before it suddenly descended more than 20,000ft in just over a minute, and crashing near the city of Wuzhou in Guangxi province. Chinese investigators have led the crash inquiry but US officials are involved as the plane is US-made. While faults in the design of Boeing's later 737-Max model were behind two fatal disasters in 2018 and 2019, leading to the model's grounding worldwide, the 737-800 has long been in everyday service around the world. Aviation experts had noted that the flight pattern shown on tracking sites, and lack of reported mayday call or any loss of data signal, resembled the Germanwings crash in 2015. On that occasion, the Airbus A320 passenger plane was crashed deliberately by the pilot as it crossed the French Alps, killing 150 people. The WSJ reported that Chinese authorities have not indicated to their US counterparts that there was any mechanical or flight-control problems with the plane that crashed on 21 March. China Eastern has said that the pilot and co-pilot had both been in good health, with no known financial or family issues. Authorities in China said soon after the crash that no emergency code had been sent from the plane, suggesting no intruder could have reached the cockpit. China's air regulator has not commented beyond saying last month that investigators were continuing their inquiries.", "f5de252f91fac69c3ea26b29743bd1d41d0b344d8f98e5c9e0d72a21": "The probable demise of abortion as a federal right in the US will be a 'catastrophe' for women in low and middle-income countries, with an emboldened anti-choice movement likely to raise renewed pressure on hard-won gains, doctors and activists have warned. The leak this month of the US supreme court's draft majority opinion, which argued that the 1973 ruling effectively legalising abortion had been 'egregiously wrong from the start', stunned and enraged many in America. But those shock waves did not stop at the borders of the US, as pro-choice figures around the world - many in countries with restrictive abortion laws and high levels of social stigma around reproductive rights - warned that Justice Samuel Alito's words would 'send a really clear message' of inspiration to anti-choice groups. 'I'm sure the pro-life or anti-choice movement in [Uganda] must be hoping and praying that the Roe v Wade legislation be overturned. I'm sure if that succeeds, it will be the biggest achievement the anti-choice movement [has] registered. I'm sure they will use it significantly to counter the work and the gains we thought we had registered,' said Kenneth Buyinza, a Kampala-based doctor. Abortion in Uganda is legal in certain circumstances but highly restricted and dogged by stigma and misinformation. A ministry of health report in 2010 attributed about 8% of the country's maternal deaths to unsafe abortion. It is far from the only country in sub-Saharan Africa to see a strong link between stubbornly high levels of maternal mortality and unsafe abortions carried out by unlicensed practitioners, often in unsanitary conditions and without the proper equipment. In such countries, the potential for the US move to encourage anti-choice politicians, judges and activists and further hold back abortion rights could not be more worrying. 'If Roe v Wade is reversed it would be a victory for anti-choice groups who finance the opposition in Africa and a catastrophe for us. It could influence policymakers and mean that in Africa we will keep seeing women dying. Whatever we have gained could be lost,' said Abebe Shibru, Ethiopia country director for MSI Reproductive Choices. Another region where Alito's words have caused alarm is Central America, where three countries have total bans on abortion: El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. In another, Guatemala, lawmakers recently increased prison sentences for women found to have had an abortion, legal only if the mother's life is at risk. Eugenia Lopez Uribe, regional director for the International Planned Parenthood Federation, warned the US move would inspire anti-choice policymakers in countries such as Guatemala. 'They can see that if they change the laws and they go against women's rights, they can do it without any consequence,' she said. 'The sign they are giving now is that women's rights can be on the table for negotiations. So this is very worrisome.' Sarah Shaw, head of advocacy at MSI, said the potential for legislative backsliding was clear. 'A lot of the countries in which we work that have less restrictive abortion laws are probably a little bit ahead of where the country is socially. So they are very, very fragile. So it's not going to take much to undermine them, overturn them,' she said. In recent years US funding has been essential to the anti-choice movement globally, and Shaw said she feared the overturning of Roe would prompt a surge in the flow of money. In countries where corruption is rife and political systems are vulnerable to 'dark money' lobbying, the impact could be sizeable. The other major concern was that in countries heavily dependent on US aid for public health programmes the move could have a 'chilling effect' on African governments' commitment to abortion provision and other reproductive rights, making them 'think twice about what they spend money on', said Shaw. 'If there's a chilling on prioritisation and funding for services that are already massively deprioritised and massively underfunded it's going to be catastrophic,' she added. Buyinza, who also works at the Uganda family planning consortium, said he worried the move could affect 'fundraising and resource allocations to maternal and child health interventions'. He added that in Uganda - perhaps as in the US - anti-choice forces would be unlikely to stop at abortion, broadening their attacks on other areas such as LGBT+ rights. '[By] taking this kind of action, [the US] is actually holding the flag very high now for countries that are still struggling with human rights issues, like, for instance, Uganda, but many other countries. There is no doubt that having this legislation overturned is going to have a significant bearing, [and] most likely it is going to be negative,' he said. In his draft opinion laying out why Roe should fall, Alito concluded that the right to abortion was 'not deeply rooted in the nation's history and traditions'. Such reasoning was deeply problematic, warned Buyinza. 'Someone might be looking at abortion rights in isolation, but ... there are so many things that are not ... rooted in Ugandan and African 'traditions and history'. And that goes beyond just abortion rights,' he added.", "68b68d66f87169e9c1d5f01393ec3f60b5f8ea847feb6b65aab75c73": "", "62a6f0c19b5771fb76c8308626c9c45d0b585c8fec14560233e5343d": "", "bb4e5825f33e5129e8b55fdd0ceaf0cdc3a385b62c8915e52b0924d7": "Last week, Dr Maya Bass, a family physician, was on a call with the medical director of Trust Women, one of four abortion clinics in Oklahoma. They were scrambling to figure out how to keep their doors open after the leak of a draft opinion signaling the supreme court's intent to overturn Roe v Wade and the Oklahoma governor's signing of SB1503 into law, banning abortions in the state after six weeks of pregnancy. 'With my colleagues, there's a lot of anger,' Bass says. 'As a medical professional, it's really hard to spend your life studying to become an expert in a certain area and then have a politician with no medical expertise and not even a uterus take away your power to offer patients safe medical care.' About once a month since 2017, Bass has traveled from her home in Camden, New Jersey, to moonlight at Trust Women Oklahoma City to help mitigate the shortage of abortion providers in the middle of the country. The tiny clinic's staff had been stretched to its limit since September, when neighboring Texas banned abortions past six weeks of pregnancy, forcing an estimated 6,000 Texans to travel to Oklahoma. But Oklahoma will no longer be a refuge for Texan patients. A near copycat of the Texas law, Oklahoma's new ban would allow any private citizen to sue any individual - doctors, nurses, pharmacists - who 'aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion' after signs of fetal cardiac activity. And in the aftermath of a Roe reversal, Oklahoma is one of 13 states that would immediately ban almost all abortions. 'The staff is exhausted,' says Bass. 'They're amazing and resilient and are probably some of the most creative humans I've ever met, in that they've been figuring out with every new legal hurdle different plans to serve as many people as possible. 'How can we legally care for patients with a 72-hour waiting period and a six-week ban? How can we pull this off?'' They considered options for fighting back. Perhaps they could best serve patients by offering consultations and pre-screenings in their Oklahoma City clinic, then sending them to their sister clinic in Wichita, Kansas, a two-and-a-half hour drive away, for the abortion procedure itself - but would that somehow put them at risk of being prosecuted for 'aiding and abetting' an abortion? Would that implicate the Wichita clinic? Would Oklahoma City staffers be able to serve more patients if they moved to Kansas to practice there? After her call with the medical director, Bass cancelled her next trip, which would have been in June. Trust Women Oklahoma City - which receives some 500 calls a day - has put a temporary hold on new appointments. 'Patients were too nervous to schedule with us,' Bass says. 'We couldn't promise we'd actually be able to see them.' The facility is now referring patients to Wichita. Appointments for the Kansas clinic are all currently full. 'Pregnancy is hard,' Bass says. 'You're tired and nauseous. People have hyperemesis - they continually vomit. Mental health disorders tend to get worse, especially during an undesired pregnancy. There are so many stories of people coming in being like, 'I can't function, I can't do my job, I've taken too many sick days.'' After an abortion, negative pregnancy side effects subside. But trigger laws that require patients to travel out of state to access care force more patients to stay pregnant longer. 'That's an extra four weeks of suffering,' Bass says. 'And that is definitely something that will worsen because even if a person has resources, the clinics that exist after Roe falls will see bigger volumes and wait periods.' For doctors around the country, the struggles of patients and providers in Texas and Oklahoma offer a glimpse of what's to come after the likely fall of Roe. 'I feel sad and I feel tired and I feel angry and incredibly motivated,' said Dr Katherine Farris, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic in Raleigh, North Carolina. 'It's stunning and gut-wrenching, but we're not surprised. We've been planning for it.' In so-called sanctuary states like North Carolina, that planning largely revolves around figuring out how already overwhelmed clinics can serve even bigger waves of abortion 'refugees'. Even with efforts to bolster staffing, clinics expect increased wait times, which will force more patients to carry pregnancies past the limit for medication abortion, leading to a demand for more second-trimester procedural abortions. 'So the people who say they're so upset by later pregnancy abortions are creating a scenario where more will occur,' Farris says. In a landscape rife with misinformation and stigma, where Googling 'how to get an abortion' often turns up misleading ads for anti-abortion 'crisis pregnancy centers', providers are preparing to educate more patients about options for safe and affordable reproductive healthcare. Even if Trust Women Oklahoma City is completely barred from providing abortions in-house, they plan to stay open, offering informational consultations and other reproductive healthcare services. 'Our patients need us as resource guides more than ever now,' Bass says. 'If someone calls me, it's not enough for me to say, 'Here's a number for the nearest clinic.' I need to say, 'Here's the clinic, here's the number for an abortion fund in this area if you have money issues, here's the free hotline for emotional consultations.' Healthcare providers need to serve our patients now by giving them clear resources, websites with up-to-date information.' Preparing for a post-Roe America also means providers are figuring out how to legally and ethically counsel patients on how to safely self-source and self-manage abortions. In a pre-Roe landscape, before the advent of abortion pills, self-managing posed serious risks of injury or death. But now, 'because of medication abortion, there are safe ways to manage at home', Bass says. 'I'm hoping more providers recognize the safety of [self-managed medication abortions] so we can support our patients through that.' Patients may self-manage through other means, such as contacting the loose underground networks of women trained to provide safe at-home abortions outside the law, using devices such as manual vacuum aspirators made from mason jars, or herbal abortifacients, such as pennyroyal tea or black cohosh. 'I have friends in the more natural, herbal world talking about going back to the old days of using different herbs,' Farris says. 'Other patients will go back to physical attempted inductions. And those will be dangerous.' Even as they plan how best to handle this latest blow to reproductive health, these doctors expect their efforts won't be enough to stem the devastation of a Roe reversal. Providers are increasingly forced into interactions with patients that feel crude and absurd. 'I've had patients sitting in front of me sobbing, saying, 'Please, please, I need you to do this today,' but they didn't get their 72-hour consent,' Farris says, referring to time mandated by states between counseling and getting an abortion. 'Or their 72-hour consent time isn't up for five more hours, and I have to say, 'I'm sorry, I need you to wait five more hours before I hand you your pill in order to be in compliance with the law.'' She says she has to explain to patients that though it breaks her heart, she can't make exceptions because it would jeopardize her being able to treat thousands of other women who need her care every year. She knows her work will continue to be sought out, likely with increasing desperation and a dire outlook. Research suggests that a total abortion ban would lead to a 21% increase in pregnancy-related deaths. 'There is going to be a lot of forced birth. People's lives are going to be devastated by this. People are going to be emotionally and financially traumatized. People's futures are going to be derailed,' Farris says. 'I will be stunned if people don't die. And it should not come down to people dying for us to reconsider autonomy.'", "dab096c5b294076aa8dc0476f06b2cf13355510b993ca03f4161a0e2": "", "07865b009abc0d4816a49b188cd2b53a0600d8797669bdb1ebe3bd9b": "More than 260 Ukrainian soldiers, many of them wounded, have been evacuated from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol, appearing to cede control of the city to Russia after 82 days of bombardment. Ukraine's deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said late on Monday that 53 heavily wounded soldiers were evacuated to a hospital in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk and that more than 200 others were transported through a corridor to Olenivka. An 'exchange procedure will take place' to bring evacuees home, she said. It was unclear how many soldiers remained in the steel plant, but Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: 'We hope to save the lives of our boys'. 'I want to underline: Ukraine needs its Ukrainian heroes alive. This is our principle,' he said in a video statement. The evacuation is likely to mark the end of the longest and bloodiest battle of the Ukraine war and a significant defeat for Ukraine. Mariupol is now in ruins after a Russian siege that Ukraine says killed tens of thousands of people in the city. For Ukrainians, the Azovstal plant has become a symbol of resistance, with hundreds of troops continuing to fight on there even after the rest of the city had fallen to Russian forces. Six hundred troops were believed to have been inside the steel plant. The general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said that the soldiers defending the steel plant had fulfilled their combat mission. 'The supreme military command ordered the commanders of the units stationed at Azovstal to save the lives of the personnel,' the general staff said in a statement on its Facebook account.

Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said that Finland and Sweden joining Nato would probably make 'not much difference' as the two countries had long participated in the alliance's military drills. 'Finland and Sweden, as well as other neutral countries, have been participating in Nato military exercises for many years,' Lavrov said, Reuters reports. 'NATO takes their territory into account when planning military advances to the East. So in this sense there is probably not much difference. Let's see how their territory is used in practice in the North Atlantic alliance.' The governor of Russia's Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, has said on Telegram that Russian forces suppressed fire from Ukraine on the Russian village of Alekseevka.

The governor said assistance would be provided to the residents of the shelled village.

The news agency writes:", "f5f5a804fe0ef8dea0e764261897b80adada8f4bdb42400790e32c8b": "Sweden and Finland will formally submit simultaneous requests to join Nato on Wednesday, the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, has said, in a seismic shift in Europe's security architecture after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 'Finland and Sweden have agreed to go through this entire process hand in hand, and we will tomorrow file the application together,' Andersson told a joint news conference with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, in Stockholm. 'Membership of Nato strengthens security in Sweden but also in the Baltic Sea region,' Andersson said. 'The fact that we are applying together with Finland means that we can contribute to security in northern Europe.' The announcement came as the White House said Niinisto, and Andersson would meet the US president, Joe Biden, on Thursday to discuss their bids to join the US-led mutual defence alliance and European security more broadly. Finland, which shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, has remained neutral or non-aligned since the end of the second world war, while Sweden has stayed out of military alliances for more than two centuries. Both had long seen Nato membership as an unnecessary provocation of Russia. Andersson said the simultaneous applications reflected the brutal impact of 'Russia's illegal war' on Ukraine and the Nordic neighbours' common history, traditions, values   and culture. 'In recent months, it has also become clear that Sweden's and Finland's security are closely linked,' she said. Niinisto said Russia's onslaught on Ukraine had 'changed everything', adding that Finnish and Swedish Nato membership meant the Nordic region would now be 'a bastion not just of democracy, welfare and human rights - but also of security'. The announcements came after the Finnish parliament on Tuesday overwhelmingly backed the government's proposal to join the alliance, and a day after Sweden's government confirmed its intention to do likewise. Finnish MPs voted by 188 votes to eight in favour of joining. Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has repeatedly said the two countries would be welcomed 'with open arms', but their applications must be approved by all the alliance's 30 members and Turkey seems set to throw a spanner in the works. Ankara has said it will not support the bids, citing Sweden and Finland's history of hosting members of Kurdish militant groups and decisions in 2019 to impose arms export embargos on Ankara over Turkey's military operations in Syria. Niinisto said in an address to Swedish MPs on Tuesday that Turkey's stance had 'changed very quickly and become harder during the last few days', but he was sure 'constructive discussions' would resolve the situation. The Finnish president said his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had backed the applications when they spoke a month ago, but in the past week 'he has said, 'not favourable'. We have to continue our discussion. I am optimistic.' Andersson said Sweden was 'looking forward to having a bilateral dialogue with Turkey. I see when both Sweden and Turkey are members of Nato, there are also opportunities to develop bilateral relations between our countries.' Washington said the administration was confident Nato could reach consensus about the applications. 'We know there's a lot of support for Sweden and Finland to join Nato,' the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said. Erdogan on Monday said Ankara would oppose the applications and there was no point diplomats even coming to Ankara to discuss it. Turkey alleges Finland and Sweden shelter people it says are linked to groups it designates as terrorist. While it is unclear how serious an obstacle Turkey's objections will prove, many analysts believe Erdogan, who faces elections next year, was seeking concessions for domestic political advantage and will not ultimately veto the Nordic nations' applications. 'They know Sweden and Finland inside the alliance is good for the alliance as a whole, and I don't foresee they will block this in the end,' said Anna Wieslander of the Atlantic Council thinktank. 'But they will negotiate along the way.' After multiple warnings that Finnish and Swedish membership of Nato would have 'serious consequences', including the possible deployment of nuclear missiles in the Baltic region, Moscow, meanwhile, now appears to be downplaying the prospect. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Monday he saw 'no immediate threat' unless Nato military infrastructure was deployed on Finnish and Swedish territory, and Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Tuesday it would make little difference as the two countries had long taken part in Nato exercises. 'Nato takes their territory into account when planning military advances to the east,' Lavrov said. 'So in this sense, there is probably not much difference. Let's see how their territory is used in practice in the North Atlantic alliance.' Meanwhile, Russia on Tuesday expelled two Finnish diplomats and summoned the Finnish ambassador to hear a protest against the country's 'confrontational course in relation to Russia'. The statement made no mention of Nato membership. The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said that all EU member states would back Finland and Sweden's applications. 'They will receive strong support, I'm sure, from all member states, because it increases our unity and it makes us stronger,' he said in Brussels. Borrell added that he hoped Nato would overcome Turkey's objections. Germany's defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, also said that while it was important that members talk 'intensively' with Turkey, she was sure Ankara would be won over. 'It is an improvement for Nato when two countries as strong as Sweden and Finland join,' Lambrecht said. 'I am convinced Turkey will also be convinced of that.'", "9ec2b10f76e78ff3744ea558d53204c14e20044b50b1b096dacd0554": "One of Ukraine's largest farming groups has called for an urgent solution to unblock the country's Black Sea ports as exports of grain, sunflower and rapeseed are being held up by the Russian naval blockade, driving inflation and shortages around the world. G7 ministers have held urgent talks about trying to open routes through Romanian and Baltic ports, potentially fed with an army of 10,000 trucks making a five-day trip from Ukraine. John Rich, the chairman of MHP, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said: 'If we had a UN agreement in place it would solve an enormous amount of issues.' But he said that without the war ending such a deal was unlikely, piling pressure on prices for grain and seeds used for cooking oil and ethanol around the world into next year.  'We are now in a vicious cycle,' Rich said. 'Normally what happens is that farmers cure high prices as [when prices go up] farmers produce more and prices collapse. This time it could be different,' Rich said pointing to a combination of climate change, the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine, as well as fertiliser shortages which are hitting production around the world. He said the world could be looking at a 'cascade of export bans', following India's block on the export of wheat and Indonesia's block on palm oil exports, raising the prospect that 'the whole concept of globalisation in food production is dead'. Exports from Ukraine, which produces as much as half the world's sunflower seeds, a tenth of wheat and up to a fifth of barley and rapeseed, have been severely interrupted by the closure of Ukraine's ports following Russia's invasion. Only about 1m tonnes of grain and seed were exported in April compared with more than 5m tonnes of grain and 700,000 tonnes of oilseeds a month in a typical year. Before the war, about 80% of Ukraine's grain and oilseeds were exported via the Black Sea but that route is now cut off, creating a bottleneck as farmers prepare to harvest the summer crops. Efforts are being made to increase the pace of exports, by increasing the use of trucks and improving rail capacity and links, which are hampered by differing track gauges in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. However, Rich said road and rail could replace little more than a quarter of the capacity that once flowed through Ukraine's ports and would take time to develop. He said MHP was fairly confident its own crops could be sent out via truck and train to ports in Poland and Lithuania, and the company was processing more sunflower seeds into oil within Ukraine, for example, to help lower transport and storage costs.  The blockade means grain silos are full and farmers are struggling to find storage for the summer crops. Without a solution, he said that many would be reluctant to plant for the winter. 'There is going to be a lot of soul searching when it comes to winter 2022 and it is going to be all about logistics and storage,' he said. 'We are in a real dilemma at present,' he said. 'There is a huge bottleneck and it is not easily solved, certainly not in the next six or eight weeks. Unless the Russian fleet is sunk, I don't see a solution. I can't see any solution to this in a very, very long time.' Production of wheat, sunflower oil and other crops in Ukraine is expected to be down by about 35% this year as planting and harvests in east of the country have been affected by fighting. Rich said production in the rest of the country was good with 'growing conditions excellent' and MHP's farms had been able to secure enough fertiliser and other inputs. 'We are in good shape, the season so far is going well,' he said, although the long range forecast for the region is that it will be unusually hot this year. But he said production could be lower as it was not clear how many small and medium-sized farms had been affected by shortages and price rises on diesel and fertiliser as well a concerns on storage.

Dozens of Russian tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and trucks lay destroyed, some sinking into the waters of the Donets River by a broken pontoon bridge, pointing to the latest disaster in Russia's three-month war in Ukraine. The toll of Russia's attempts to cross the river, part of its costly offensive in the east, are staggering: more than 485 killed and as many as 80 vehicles destroyed, according to one estimate, although no numbers of casualties have been confirmed. As Russia continues to hide the scale of its losses in Ukraine, more and more information has leaked out, angering the families of Russian soldiers and discouraging even previous supporters of the invasion. 'I look at my government totally different since the war started,' said Tatyana Efremenko, 39, whose son Nikita Efremenko was a conscript on the Moskva missile cruiser when it was sunk in a Ukrainian missile strike one month ago. She is still searching for her son. 'There are some very harsh things I would like to say about our leadership, but maybe best if I don't because they would put me in prison for it.' In Russian-controlled east Ukraine, wives of fighters have complained on camera that their husbands were left behind as Russian soldiers retreated across the border near Kharkiv. 'They aren't deserters, just those who managed to get away with their lives,' one woman yelled at a local official. Kyiv has said that it has the remains of thousands of Russian soldiers, but Moscow won't accept them because that would force it to admit the high death toll in the war. As evidence of the Bilohorivka rout became clear over the last week, even some pro-Russian cheerleaders appeared to be losing faith in the wisdom of the country's military leadership. 'Until we know the name of the 'military genius' who put a battalion tactical group by the river and he doesn't answer for it publicly, then there will never be reforms in the army,' wrote Vladlen Tatarzky, the pseudonym used by a Russian blogger and former soldier who has more than 300,000 subscribers on Telegram. He has generally supported the war. 'How can one not remember comrade Stalin here, who despite the difficult military situation was not afraid to take difficult personnel decisions? If this isn't done, then no mobilisation will save us.' Rob Lee, a senior fellow in the Foreign Policy Research Institute's Eurasia Program who documented some of that backlash to the war, noted that another popular blogger wrote that it was 'idiocy or sabotage to make such a mistake three months into the war'. And Igor Girkin, a Russian proxy field commander during the 2014 war who has been critical of the government during this conflict, appeared to feel vindicated: 'I have already said several times what needs to be done in the current situation, when it has become clear that our forces are unable to deliver even a limited defeat to the enemy in ground combat and when we must prepare for a drawn-out, difficult, full-scale war.' A month after the sinking of the Moskva, the Russian government has only confirmed the death of one crew member and said another 27 were missing. But the families of crew members say that the death toll could be as high as 200, and many have not received any confirmation about what happened to their husbands, brothers, and sons. 'No one is telling me anything,' said Efremenko, whose son disappeared on the ship, in an interview. 'They asked me to sign a document which says I accept that my son died and then they want to compensate me for his death. They have sent the same document to all the parents of all the other missing conscripts, too.' Efremenko said that she was in a Telegram chat with more than 80 family members of those who were missing. Many have been told not to speak to the press or go public. 'They are trying to buy my silence, but it won't happen,' she said. 'I will look for my son until the end. 'I promised the authorities that I wouldn't talk publicly about my son, but already a month has passed and people are forgetting about Moskva. People are moving on, but we still have so many unanswered questions: why the hell were conscripts there? Why were they fighting? No one has been able to tell me this.' On Monday, the Ukrainian government also released new data claiming that Russia's 1st Guards Tank Army lost a staggering 131 tanks in just the first three weeks of the war, one of the bloodiest periods of combat for the Russian army. The data on personnel and vehicle losses for the unit 'could be genuine', said Michael Kofman, research programme director in the Russia studies programme at the CNA thinktank. Russia last released casualty data in late March, admitting that 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed and 3,825 wounded in the first month of the war. The government has not released any more information on casualties in the last month and a half, except to say that they were 'significant'. Western estimates have been 10 or even 20 times as high, with some suggesting that Russia has lost more than 30,000 soldiers since the beginning of the war. Kofman wrote: 'Numbers get thrown about with broad ranges, and it is hard to say what to make of these estimates, or guesstimates.' As Ukrainian forces launch a counterattack that has reached the Russian border near Kharkiv, Russian soldiers are also being accused of abandoning their allies from the Donbas region of Ukraine. Video reportedly shot in the Luhansk region showed women surrounding a local official and pleading for him to help their family members. 'They aren't being allowed on to Russian territory,' said one woman. 'They didn't give in. They were completely destroyed.' The descriptions matched some images of mobilised conscripts from the Russian-controlled territories of Donetsk and Luhansk who were pictured with light body armour and Mosin-Nagant rifles that are badly outdated on a modern battlefield. 'They're facing tanks and all they had were pistols,' the woman said.", "ad8698c9fec102f8c83e1e6b1e41eb54ad74251a687122a8bceefb7a": "North Korea stands on the brink of a Covid-19 catastrophe unless swift action is taken to provide vaccines and drug treatments, experts have said, as the number of people reported to have fallen ill rose to almost 1.5 million. The isolated country reported another big rise in new cases of what it continues to refer to as 'fever' on Tuesday, days after it admitted it had identified Covid-19 infections for the first time since the start of the global pandemic. It recorded 269,510 additional cases and six more deaths, bringing the total number killed to 56 since late last month. About 1.48 million people have become ill with the virus since the first case was reported last Thursday and at least 663,910 people were in quarantine, according to official figures. The outbreak is almost certainly greater than the official tally, given a lack of tests and resources to monitor and treat the sick. A significant Covid-19 outbreak could unleash a humanitarian crisis in North Korea, where the economy has been battered by the pandemic-enforced closure of its border with China - its main trading partner - natural disasters, and years of international sanctions imposed in response to ballistic missile tests. The regime is not thought to have vaccinated any of its population and does not have access to antiviral drugs that have been used to treat Covid-19 in other countries. Its hospitals have few intensive-care resources to treat severe cases, and widespread malnourishment has made the population of 26 million more susceptible to serious illness. 'It looks really bad,' said Owen Miller, a lecturer in Korean studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London University. 'They are facing the rampant spread of Omicron without protection from vaccines, without much - if any - immunity in the population and without access to most of the drugs that have been used to treat Covid elsewhere.' Offers of outside help have so far been met with silence. Instead, there is concern that the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, may be willing to accept a large but 'manageable' number of cases and deaths to avoid opening his country up to international scrutiny. Since it reported its first cases last week, North Korea's propaganda machine has portrayed the virus as an enemy that can be defeated through lockdowns, quarantine and greater vigilance. The state-run KCNA news agency has reported the delivery of unspecified drugs - 'the elixir of life' - to pharmacies by army medical units, and public health campaigns calling for mask-wearing and social distancing. But testing levels are far below what is needed to form an accurate picture of the outbreak and to quickly identify and isolate patients. Some observers speculated that authorities were deliberately underreporting cases to ease the pressure on Kim. North Korea has tested just 64,200 people since the start of the pandemic's start, according to the World Health Organization, compared with 172 million in the neighbouring South. 'We were talking about a 0.1% fatality rate for Omicron in South Korea, but that's going to be significantly higher in North Korea, possibly even reaching 1%, although it's difficult to make accurate predictions at this point,' said Jung Jae-hun, a professor of preventive medicine at Gachon University. Kim, who says the outbreak is causing 'great turmoil', finds himself having to balance public health measures with efforts to revive the crumbling economy. A ruling party member in North Hamgyong province said people were still going to work and markets remained open, reported the Japan-based Asia Press. 'There are no bans on going outside. However, we've been ordered to double mask,' the unidentified official told the website, which receives information from citizen journalists equipped with contraband Chinese mobile phones.  'People are going to factories and to their places of work as normal. The authorities don't want work to be disrupted. People get fever checks when they go to and from work.' The official said people were more concerned about being locked down and prevented from working than catching Covid-19. 'People are worried about how to survive.' Some initially interpreted North Korea's admission that it was battling the virus - after two years of denying it had found a single case - as a plea for help. But it has already refused millions of vaccine doses via the UN-backed Covax scheme, while South Korea says it has yet to receive a response to its offer this week of vaccines, drugs and medical staff. 'I'm sure the North Koreans will still be very wary of accepting major international aid and going back to the situation of the 1990s, when there were multiple different aid agencies operating in the country and this was felt by the leadership to be humiliating and potentially destabilising,' Miller said, adding that the regime was more likely to turn to China for medical aid. The Omicron variant has caused significantly fewer deaths and serious cases than previous strains in countries with high vaccination rates, proper medical services and previous exposure to Covid-19. But that pattern is unlikely to be repeated in North Korea, said Kim Sin-gon, a professor at Korea University College of Medicine in Seoul. 'North Korea has many vulnerable people who don't have strong immune systems,' he said. 'Its official inoculation rate is zero and it has no Covid-19 treatment pills.' Without urgent international help, Kim added, 'North Korea may end up with the pandemic's worst death and infection rates in the world for its population size.'

The unnamed man's arrest on Monday followed a two-year investigation, Metropolitan police said - and related to offences alleged to have been committed between 2002 and 2009. In a statement, the Met said 'a man, aged in his 50s, was arrested on suspicion of indecent assault, sexual assault, rape, abuse of position of trust and misconduct in public office. He remains in custody'. 'The offences are alleged to have occurred in London. An investigation is ongoing, led by officers from Central Specialist Crime.' Westminster sources suggested some of the offences are believed to have taken place in parliament. The MP's arrest came as a date was announced for two byelections triggered by the resignation of Conservative MPs. Imran Ahmad Khan, the former MP for Wakefield, was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy; while former Tiverton MP Neil Parish admitted watching pornography in the House of Commons chamber. Both contests will take place on 23 June, with Labour hoping to win in Wakefield, and the Liberal Democrats positioning themselves as the challengers in Tiverton. The LibDems pulled off a shock victory in North Shropshire last year, after Owen Paterson resigned over paid lobbying. Another Conservative MP, David Warburton, who represents Somerton and Frome, has had the whip suspended while under investigation for sexual harassment by the House of Commons' Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme. A Conservative Whips' Office spokesperson said the MP would be asked not to come to parliament. 'The chief whip has asked that the MP concerned does not attend the parliamentary estate while an investigation is ongoing. Until the conclusion of the investigation we will not be commenting further.' It is understood no decision will be made about whether to remove the whip from the MP until the police investigation is completed, in order to protect the anonymity of the victims. This latest case will reopen concerns about the culture at Westminster, and whether it is a safe place to work. Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of Prospect union, said: 'What will it take for parliament to finally take its responsibility to its staff and visitors seriously and suspend access to the estate for parliamentarians under investigation for sexual offences? 'Voluntary agreements to stay away do not work, as demonstrated by Imran Ahmad Khan's attendance at Westminster whilst investigations were ongoing, despite agreeing to stay away. Parliament has the same responsibilities towards its staff as any other workplace and it must live up to them.' Female Conservative MPs recently met the chief whip to air their concerns about the behaviour of some colleagues - a gathering that led to Parish's resignation, after his behaviour was discussed. The leader of the House of Commons, Mark Spencer, said last week that his party was committed to selecting higher quality candidates at the next general election, claiming the snap contests of 2017 and 2019 had led to mistakes. 'I think we'll be in a much better place at the next general election, certainly in the [Conservative] party as we will have taken much more time to scrutinise people. There will be a much longer process,' he said. Details of the MP's arrest emerged during what the government had hoped would be 'crime week', with announcements on toughening up policing. The prime minister told his cabinet on Tuesday morning: 'Crime, crime, crime is what we want to focus on.' The Met continues to investigate gatherings held in Downing Street and Whitehall during Covid lockdowns. More than 100 fixed-penalty notices have so far been issued, though Johnson has only been fined once, along with his wife, Carrie Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, for a birthday party held in 2020. Many Conservative backbenchers are concerned about the impact on the Tories' reputation as the party of law and order - but have so far declined to move against the prime minister by demanding a vote of no confidence.", "4c843952f8b2d6c1e7e7ca780a05ab4d7c02ae73f94dd6af0eeefacc": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol is not expecting to call Donald Trump to testify about potentially unlawful schemes to stop the certification of Joe Biden's election win, its chairman said on Tuesday.The panel has been weighing for months whether to seek voluntary cooperation or subpoena the former president in its wide-ranging inquiry in an effort to obtain his insight into unlawful schemes to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the select committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill that it was 'not our expectation' to demand testimony from Trump. The chairman indicated that the panel had decided - at least for now - against demanding cooperation from the former president given it remained unclear whether Trump would provide information that could help advance the inquiry. 'We're not sure that the evidence that we receive can be any more validated with his presence,' Thompson said. 'I think the concern is whether or not he would add any more value with his testimony.' Thompson did not completely rule out the prospect of seeking written or oral testimony from Trump. He added that discussions continued about calling the former vice-president Mike Pence to appear before the select committee. The skepticism about demanding cooperation from the 'principals' in the investigation, such as Trump and Pence, comes in large part because the panel is not convinced the benefits outweigh the political headaches of such a move. Trump would almost certainly attempt to turn a request for cooperation from the panel into a political circus, and if Trump asserted the fifth amendment or said he could not recall the answers to questions in a deposition, that would waste valuable time and resources in the investigation. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice has asked the panel for transcripts of its witness interviews, the New York Times reported on Tuesday afternoon. The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, noted that the move suggested a further sign that US attorney general Merrick Garland is intensifying his department's separate investigation into events on and around January 6 last year.", "6e0a768f677d3dc36a694ca824420e407fbdb9582fa2bbc4c2052105": "The new French prime minister, Elisabeth Borne, has immediately come under pressure from environmentalists on the left who warned 'hopes were low' that she would drastically cut France's carbon emissions or move fast enough to address global heating, despite Emmanuel Macron's election promise to make France a world-leader on the climate emergency. Borne's first comments after taking office were to promise to 'act faster and stronger' to deal with climate challenges, after the newly re-elected centrist president, Macron, promised his prime minister special oversight powers to plan France's transition to become 'the first major nation to abandon gas, oil and coal.' The Elysee is expected to announce a new French government in the coming days, which could include several ministers dedicated to 'green planning', after France has fallen behind in recent years on targets on tackling emissions and increasing renewables. But Julien Bayou, head of the Green party, EELV, which has joined a leftwing alliance under the radical left's Jean-Luc Melenchon for the parliamentary elections next month, said: 'Hopes are low.' He said the climate emergency would now be a key battleground for next month's elections, in which the left was seeking to gain ground. Bayou said Borne shared with others in government 'the responsibility of five lost years for the environment' during Macron's first term in office, arguing that not enough had been done on emissions or transport, nor to put in place the suggestions of the citizens' assembly, which was randomly selected from civil society to advise on cutting carbon emissions. Jean-Francois Julliard, head of Greenpeace in France, said Borne needed to urgently and clearly set out how she would 'transform French society' so it wasted less energy and natural resources. Cecile Duflot, the former Green leader, said: 'Will she have any latitude of action from the president, who has never demonstrably put in place his engagements on ecology?' The appointment of the first French female prime minister in over 30 years was praised by many parties as an important step for equality on the French political scene, which is often criticised for being 'macho'. Immediately after taking office, Borne met lawmakers as she prepared to lead Macron's broad centrist grouping into June's parliamentary elections against Melenchon's leftwing alliance and Marine Le Pen's far right, both of whom want to increase their seats. Borne, 61, an engineer who held three ministerial roles in Macron's first term - labour, transport and environment - has never run for elected office herself. On Tuesday, she told lawmakers for Macron's newly renamed party, Renaissance, that she would go ahead with her own campaign to win election to parliament for a Normandy seat in Calvados, where her mother's family was from. The seat would give her a crucial local base and a political standing beyond her reputation as a technocrat. 'We need as big a majority as possible,' Borne told lawmakers. For Macron to have a free hand for his domestic overhaul of the pensions and benefits system, as well as changes to schools and the health service, he needs a solid parliament majority. If Borne does not win the Calvados seat, which is held by Macron's party and is seen as safe, her future in the role as prime minister could be called into question. Macron has already set out Borne's priorities, which include environmental policy, an overhaul of the education and health system, returning France to full employment and restoring voters' confidence in the democratic system. But amid rising concern over the cost of living crisis, Macron acknowledged during the campaign that he needed to counter his image as haughty and aloof and listen to concerns on the ground. Similarly, Borne must show that she understands and can engage with voters on the ground if she is to push through Macron's contested plan for a pensions overhaul to push back the retirement age from 62 to 64 or 65. Borne said she believed political policy was shaped through 'dialogue'. But already trade unions on the left were preparing a challenge over pensions. 'She listens, but she doesn't hear, she's like Macron,' said Philippe Martinez, from the leftwing CGT union.", "7485f07b6354e800284eaa4da212dae7921bb93449fadda8110f2387": "Two white Canadian men followed and then shot dead two Indigenous hunters because they believed they were thieves, prosecutors have told a court at the start of a murder trial in Alberta. Roger Bilodeau, 58, and his son Anthony Bilodeau, 33, have both pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder over the deaths of Jacob Sansom and his uncle, Maurice Cardinal in March 2020. The bodies of Sansom, 39, and Cardinal, 57, were found early on 28 March beside Sansom's pickup truck on a country road near Glendon, a farming town 160 miles north-east of Edmonton. Sansom had recently lost his job as a mechanic and worked as a volunteer firefighter. Cardinal was a keen hunter and outdoorsman. Both were Metis - a distinct group that traces lineage to both Indigenous nations and European settlers - and had permission to hunt the area out of season. The killing of the men, who were returning from a successful moose hunting trip to help provide food for family members, shocked the region. Prosecutors told an Edmonton jury on Monday that the two Bilodeaus followed the two hunters, assuming the men were thieves. Roger Bilodeau believed the hunters' truck resembled a vehicle that had been on his property earlier that day. As he followed the truck, Bilodeau called his son and asked him to follow behind and to bring a gun, said the Crown. Roger Bilodeau and the hunters stopped their trucks along a country road near Glendon. Anthony Bilodeau arrived moments later and prosecutors say he shot Sansom, then Cardinal. A postmortem concluded that Sansom was shot once in the chest and Cardinal was shot three times in his shoulder. The Bilodeaus then drove away without notifying police or paramedics. The bodies of the two men - Sansom lying in the middle of the road and Cardinal in a ditch - were discovered early the next morning by a motorist. 'These were in no way justified killings,' said prosecutor Jordan Kerr, adding that the younger Bilodeau 'freely made the decision to arm himself' and pursue the two men. Roger Bilodeau 'clearly anticipated having a confrontation' and so 'recruited' his son into bringing a weapon, Kerr said. But a lawyer for the Bilodeaus say the men acted in self defence amid concerns over property crime in the area. Lawyer Shawn Gerstel told the jury that the encounter on the rural road that night quickly escalated and that Sansom had smashed a window of Roger's truck and punched him multiple times. '[Roger] asked for a gun for protection because he didn't know who he was dealing with,' said Gerstel. The defence said the collar of Roger's shirt was torn half off and Sansom's blood was found on three areas of Bilodeau's shirt. The defence also alleges the hunters were drunk and a medical examiner is expected to testify that Sansom's blood alcohol levelwas almost triple the legal driving limit. Cardinal's blood alcohol limit was nearly double the legal the limit for driving, the defence says. On Monday, Sansom's brother James told the court that Jacob was trained as a martial artist and had the ability to de-escalate tense situations. The trial continues.", "a7951715597494062ec170e0978f7af0bfc85de0072884240887709b": "The frontman and the guitarist for the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal have told a Paris court how they watched from the stage in confusion and horror as terrorists opened fire on the crowd at their sold-out concert at the Bataclan in 2015. Jesse Hughes, the band's singer, and Eden Galindo, a guitarist, both said the attack, which left 90 people dead, had changed their lives for ever. They had travelled to Paris to give evidence in France's biggest-ever criminal trial, over the attacks claimed by Islamic State on 13 November 2015. A total of 130 were killed and more than 400 were injured in synchronised suicide bombings and mass shootings across the French capital, from the national stadium to bars and restaurants and the Bataclan rock gig. Hughes, 49, said the gig should have been the best of their tour and he had been 'really excited' to play in Paris.  He said he recognised the sound of gunfire instantly when three gunmen with suicide vests burst in mid-show and opened fire. 'Being from a desert community in California, I know the sound of gunshots,' he said.  While other band members hesitated and wondered what was going on, Hughes said he 'knew death was upon us'. He said the band 'ran for their lives' while 'nearly 90 of my friends [the fans] were murdered in front of us'. The band escaped through a side door after Hughes had found his girlfriend in the concert hall.  Arthur Denouveaux, a rock fan who is now the president of the survivors' group Life for Paris, was among fans who managed to escape at the same time. He led the band members running through Paris streets, handing them EUR50 and putting them in a taxi to the nearest police station, where they found other fans covered in blood.  During the wait there, they learned that Nick Alexander, who had been working on the band's merchandise at the gig, had been killed. Hughes said that six years on he still got nervous looking into crowds, and he had been anxious about giving evidence, with emotions rising up that he thought he had got over. But he said: 'Evil did not win ... You can't kill rock'n'roll.' Galindo, 52, said it had been a great show, with everyone dancing, and he had not understood the sound of gunshots at first, thinking it was the sound system. He said there were so many people in front of the stage that they could not move and he recalled the fans' faces looking up at the band and the stage in confusion as the terrorists opened fire. 'We were thinking that it was going to stop but it just kept coming,' Galindo told the court. 'After a while they reloaded and a technician told us: 'Next time they stop, we run.'' He said that when he had got home to the US he felt 'broken' and found it hard to talk about 'normal things'. He eventually left the band. 'I'll never be the same after that night,' he said, adding that he thought of the victims' families every day. Hughes, arriving at the courthouse earlier on Tuesday, had been asked by the media how he felt to be in court facing Salah Abdeslam, believed to be the last survivor from the cell of 10 men who struck across Paris that night, as well as several others accused of preparing or helping the attacks. Hughes said: 'I'm a Christian and everyone can be lost and everyone needs to find the way and most of the gentlemen in there do, so I forgive them and I hope that they find the peace of God themselves.'

Josef Schutz has pleaded not guilty, disputing any involvement in the murders of 3,518 prisoners at the Sachsenhausen camp in Oranienburg, north of Berlin, between 1942 and 1945. But prosecutors in Brandenburg state said on Tuesday that he 'knowingly and willingly' participated in the crimes as a guard at the camp. More than 200,000 people, including Jews, Roma, regime opponents and gay people, were detained at the Sachsenhausen camp between 1936 and 1945. Tens of thousands died from forced labour, murder, medical experiments, hunger or disease before the camp was liberated by Soviet troops, according to the Sachsenhausen Memorial and Museum. Cross-examined about his work at the camp, Schutz denied he had knowledge about what happened there, and insisted he had done 'absolutely nothing'. The allegations against him include aiding and abetting the 'execution by firing squad of Soviet prisoners of war in 1942' and the murder of prisoners 'using the poisonous gas Zyklon B'. Schutz has remained at liberty during the trial. If convicted, he is highly unlikely to be put behind bars given his age. Thomas Walther, who represents civil plaintiffs, said the trial was important even at this late date. 'It is important to set an example. After decades of errors, the very careful procedure has shown that German justice has learned something.' More than seven decades after the second world war, German prosecutors are racing to bring the last surviving Nazi perpetrators to justice. The 2011 conviction of the former guard John Demjanjuk on the basis that he served as part of Hitler's killing machine set a legal precedent and paved the way to several of these twilight justice cases. Since then, courts have handed down several guilty verdicts on those grounds rather than for murders or atrocities directly linked to the individual accused. Among those brought to late justice were Oskar Groning, an accountant at Auschwitz, and Reinhold Hanning, a former SS guard at Auschwitz. Both were convicted at the age of 94 of complicity in mass murder but died before they could be imprisoned. Another former SS guard, Bruno Dey, was found guilty at the age of 93 in 2020 and given a two-year suspended sentence. In the northern German town of Itzehoe, a 96-year-old former secretary in a Nazi death camp is on trial for complicity in murder. She fled before the start of her trial but was caught several hours later. Schutz's trial began in 2021, but several hearings have had to be postponed because of his health. A verdict is expected in early June.", "d038c3cde47340468183a5b8fb06a3c07ebba5217678a4e939af13f8": "", "db1aeb56fbfb5a6fd726037813481646edb5e1f087089ad5a4afe395": "", "d2b942a5f3d8ac3aeeae6723daba07b5d31054962a27d01491105fc8": "Elon Musk has said his $44bn (PS35bn) planned takeover of Twitter cannot progress until the microblogging platform proves that fewer than 5% of its users are fake or spam accounts. There is a strong chance the world's richest person could try to walk away from the deal or to negotiate a lower price than the agreed $54.20 a share. This raises questions about what actions Musk can take under the terms of the deal he signed last month with Twitter, which experts say gives the Tesla chief executive limited room for manoeuvre.  Yes it is, and it is very detailed. For all the talk from Musk of putting the deal on hold or negotiating a lower price, he has committed himself to the takeover at $54.20 a share by signing a formal agreement. It is going to be difficult to wriggle out of it. As section 6.3 (a) states: 'The parties hereto will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this agreement.' It is a standard clause, according to Brian Quinn, an associate professor at Boston College law school, but has bite. 'In all contracts, there is an implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing. Musk agrees to use his 'reasonable best efforts' to get the deal done. He can't torpedo the deal by simply refusing to continue,' Quinn said. Musk indicated on Monday that his concerns about fake or spam accounts on Twitter - that the actual numbers are higher than Twitter estimates - could constitute a 'material adverse misstatement', if it emerges that the platform's fake or bot accounts amount to far more than 5% of its 229 million user base. Musk could argue that, if it transpires Twitter has much higher-than-expected fake or spam account numbers, it constitutes a 'material adverse effect' and he should be allowed to walk away from the agreement. However, the adverse effect clause is difficult to get past a court. In one exceptional case in the state of Delaware - the jurisdiction of the Twitter deal - a judge allowed a company to scrap a deal because a whistleblower revealed fraud at the selling business. But Musk is on much trickier ground. Twitter has flagged the 5% figure in its quarterly results for the past eight years, with the caveat that the true number could be higher. Musk knew what he was signing up for, Quinn said. 'Bots are a well-known problem on Twitter. Musk even pointed to getting rid of bots as one way his ownership would add value to the business. Now, he is apparently shocked that there are bots on the platform? It's a weak pretext with no legal legs. 'Also, Twitter's disclosure to the US Securities and Exchange Commission with regard to bots is sufficiently hedged that a buyer should reasonably know that it might be higher than 5%.' Morgan Ricks, professor of law at Vanderbilt Law School, adds: 'Nothing that has happened so far comes anywhere close to a material adverse effect. Musk's comments about fake accounts are an irrelevant sideshow.' No, but there is a scenario where one could be negotiated. If Musk were to walk away Twitter would probably hold his feet to the fire, suing him in Delaware under the terms of the deal. As the litigation rolls on both parties could seek to negotiate a new price. However, in a strictly legal sense, Musk's hand is not strong. Again, no. The deal agreement not only includes a $1bn break fee if Musk does quit, but Twitter can also enact a clause that could force Musk to complete the deal at $54.20 a share. Section 9.9 of the agreement entitles Twitter to 'specific performance', whereby Musk has to pay up if he still has the debt-financing in place and Twitter still wants to close the deal. Twitter is in control here, Quinn said. 'The remedy - a termination fee or specific performance is at the election of the company, not Musk,' he said. Vanderbilt's Ricks adds: 'If Musk isn't willing to close at $54.20 and if the parties can't reach a revised deal or settlement, Twitter will very likely sue for specific performance.'Twitter, for its part, remains committed despite Musk's behaviour. In a statement on Tuesday it said: 'Twitter is committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable.' Whatever happens with Twitter, Musk's actions in recent weeks will have alarmed boardrooms around the US and the world. Ricks says Musk might find some tougher conditions attached to the next attempted takeover. 'Any board selling their company to Musk should insist on an extremely high break fee and make him put it into an escrow account upfront.'", "9afb6e869c631aa187520df86cf75c207170f83a5377f0fbd29d76c2": "Forty-three kites bearing 43 black-and-white faces hang from the ceiling of the Reina Sofia, each one a mute appeal for answers, remembrance and justice. Close by, T-shirts and posters clamour for equality, a forest of placards commemorates the detained, disappeared and dead of Uruguay's military dictatorship, and an icon of the struggle for Peruvian independence undergoes a queer, pop art makeover. The latest exhibition at the Madrid gallery explores how graphic art - whether on walls, posters, prints, flyers or fabric - has been used to confront political repression and demand social justice in Latin America and beyond over the past 50 years. Called Graphic Turn: Like the Ivy on a Wall, it hopscotches around some of the key sociopolitical moments in recent regional history, examining the responses they elicited on the streets and beyond. The show is based on research by the Red Conceptualismos del Sur (Southern Conceptualisms Network), which has spent years examining how street art has been used as a tool of creative resistance in Latin America. While some of the exhibits fizz with rage at dictators, torturers and foreign interference - one poster titled Stop Yankee Attacks on Nicaragua shows an American eagle swooping towards an armed crowd - others derive their power from silence and pain. A whole room is given over to the 43 student teachers who were disappeared in Mexico in 2014 and whose fate sparked furious protests. As well as the posters and kites that feature the faces of the missing, there are panels embroidered with messages, some plaintive - 'They sowed the seeds of tomorrow's struggle', 'Your future students are waiting for you in the mountains so they can learn their first letters' - and some angry: 'They took them alive, we want them alive' and 'No forgiving, no forgetting'. Another room uses drawings, posters and photos to chronicle the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua - and chart President Daniel Ortega's slide into despotism. 'These are posters here that are designed to be stuck on the streets,' said Ana Longoni, one of the coordinators for the Southern Conceptualisms Network. 'But for us what's also very important is that while these materials, techniques and tools can be used in public spaces, when you put them in a museum, they can also be a very powerful sounding board for what's happening right now in Latin America and in other parts of the world.' According to Manuel Borja-Villel, the director of the Reina Sofia, the project is about seeing political graphic art as something that 'lives, mutates, and creates a dialogue between its past and its future'. In the show's catalogue, he writes: 'Like ivy, graphic art grows on walls that are no longer made of stone, and it breaks out again and again. It takes on new forms - which often contain echoes of its previous incarnations - but it never loses its ability to ask questions of us.' The exhibition also looks into how marginalised and abused people have used graphic art to fight back. A poster by the Peruvian artist Natalia Iguiniz, titled My Body Is Not the Battlefield, shows an Indigenous woman silhouetted against a camouflage background and serves as a reminder that thousands of women and girls were raped during the country's war against terrorist groups in the 1980s and early 1990s. Thousands of Peruvian women - many of them poor, illiterate and indigenous - were also forcibly sterilised under the authoritarian government of Alberto Fujimori in the late 90s. Another Peruvian piece appears in the show's In Secret area, which reflects how LGBT groups in Latin America used graphic art to connect and organise in the 70s and 80s. Javier Vargas Sotomayor's 2006 work, The Counterfeiting of the Tupamaros, is a response to the murder of eight gay and trans men who were killed by terrorists from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement in northern Peru in 1989. In it, the artist takes the portrait of the martyred, 18th-century Peruvian independence leader Tupac Amaru II - from whom the terrorists drew their name - and subverts his masculine, martial image by blending his features with those of famous women including Frida Kahlo, Farrah Fawcett and Marilyn Monroe. Sol Henaro, another of the exhibition's investigators, likes to see the project as 'a series of detonators' rather than something exhaustive, encyclopaedic or linear. 'There's a poem by a Paraguayan poet, Susy Delgado, called Curuguaty-Ayotzinapa, which is about two very tragic contemporary moments,' she said. 'The last bit reads, 'The same tragic story/repeated a thousand times over/in time's deaf notebook'. We think this exhibition is about being time's deaf notebook.'", "c5354db64fd807af97785aa92ea2271844d00c856e77a588a6e85cf5": "Violence and arrests will not deter Sudan's young activists from resisting the military who 'stole our revolution', says one man who faces down the teargas and bullets in a blue and red superhero costume. Featured in a new Guardian documentary, 'the 'Spider-Man' of Sudan', who cannot be named for his safety, has become a symbol of protests that began in October. Dressed in his increasingly frayed suit and mask he and other demonstrators confront teargas canisters, water cannon and often live bullets. During the protests his childhood friend was killed by security forces, who have also been accused of sexually assaulting women and hunting down activists. It was as a homage to his friend that he picked up the suit, less as a disguise than as a symbol of both his loss and the account they heard as children, of the spider who protects the Prophet Muhammed and his companion by spinning a web across the mouth of a cave they are hiding in, meaning their enemies pass by without looking in. 'Spidey' was among hundreds of thousands of people whose protests in 2019 led to the fall of dictator Omar al-Bashir and the creation of a transitional government, which was itself ousted in a military coup in October 2021. 'The military and counter-revolutionary parties, they stole Sudan's revolution. They are like the former government of 30 years - there's no difference between them and [Bashir's] National Congress party,' he said. 'They are dictators and they want only control.' Spidey was filmed as he took part in the protests, as well as in his other role as a self-taught scientist who teaches robotics to young children. At a secret meeting of a resistance committee coordinating localised actions around Sudan, Spidey and his fellow activists spoke of how they felt united with Sudanese people in their goal to overthrow the military, regardless of the violence used against them. 'The night comes and the night goes, every day is like this,' Spidey said. 'With the will of God, we still come out. Until today we continue to try to liberate the country but we have no fear. The people of Sudan, all of them, will continue to face the security forces and their bullets.' At least 95 people have been killed in the protests since October, according to the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, a pro-reform group which has also warned about the increased use of shotguns on the crowds by security forces, causing high numbers of casualties. According to film-maker Phil Cox, Spidey has become a representation of the atmosphere in the country. His distinctive suit seems to energise protesters around him and symbolises the resistance, while his teaching work was galvanised by the 2019 movement, like many other social and cultural activities. 'It was pretty amazing what people were doing - digital start-ups, creative collectives - but they're now under threat and being closed down by the military,' said Cox. After the revolution in 2019 was overturned, he said, many of those young activists became angry and distrustful of people in power, including international negotiators. 'They feel the attention has drifted and they're on their own and they're absolutely not backing down ... they trusted, they tried and they think the international community will let them down again.'", "486639d223c6e4a82f0d191eb39ed23c296b2a7508fc7a6b6813d02c": "", "872d844a917e8cf00ebedf778d7b6da63ae84107f18ca3de94d19d05": "", "f0b88263c6ba351cdd166187446589897c5d6ef6f0c5f0a98335ce0f": "", "b2a584202b4ac83c6311967ac85c572694c605e064114d3f2c6d79b1": "", "a0949c80b0d35fa2823cf3a185181569262fba6dd7b584de41879314": "", "4e24657aee7b81b96f852f74a3456a92dec04f39ea5680d628ea9fe6": "", "0c4afd14e651470f133d0043b4f8724c1055ad7e6167f7f139c5e677": "", "18f8179bc3c8c21fedf40aa5199bc820b735e99bb779714043fca2be": "", "48c3da388dffe9319fb1d35d1b26db0e436e44944e82b64304a1f4cd": "", "34be110c59d4e29c17e47fc9b395b18f57c9bee84a2326b077fc1f85": "", "80a3b9e87a353f1fab1ea6c04716d78af33a171f99280f60fb2f1584": "", "5463c79b7ca0609ab63252814db0bf5ef94d6dabd0e6913f7990b49c": "Mexican farmers have travelled to London to demand that a FTSE 100 company compensates them for illegal mining on their land and explain violence against anti-mining activists. Penmont mining, a subsidiary of Fresnillo, was ordered by an agrarian court in Mexico in 2013 to pay members of El Bajio community, co-owners of common land in Sonora, north-west Mexico, for the gold extracted and to restore the land to its original state. Having bought shares in Fresnillo, three El Bajio representatives, as well as activists from London Mining Network and London Mexico Solidarity, entered the company's annual meeting to ask the chairman why it had not complied with the court order and about the kidnapping, disappearance and murder of anti-mining activists. Fresnillo told the Guardian it had complied with the court order by vacating the land and that it had no connection to any violence. Jesus Thomas, one of the co-owners, said after the meeting: 'We have spent eight years trying to get justice for our people. There are tonnes of cyanide in the soil, a lot of animals are dead. I made it clear to them [in the meeting] that they are in the wrong. They never said anything in reply, they don't have any answer. 'At least the owners of the company now have the right information to decide whether they are going to do the right thing.' In 2018, two members of El Bajio community - Raul Ibarra de la Paz and his wife, Noemi Lopez - were killed and disappeared respectively. Last year the president of the community, Jose de Jesus Robledo Cruz, and his wife, Maria de Jesus Gomez Vega, were killed and a list of the names of 13 other members who have fought against mining was found next to their bodies. Penmont has previously suggested criminal gangs were to blame for the violence. Fresnillio, which in 2008 became the first Mexican company to list on the London Stock Exchange, made gross profit of $936.9m (PS788m) last year, according to its annual report. El Bajio says that between 2010 and 2013 the company extracted 236,709 ounces of gold and removed 10,833,527 tonnes of earth, making profits of about $436m. A spokesperson for Fresnillo said: 'Our purpose is to contribute to the wellbeing of people through the sustainable mining of silver and gold. Core to this is how we engage with our local communities and we are proud to have an extensive series of community programmes across our business based on decades of trust and cooperation. 'We comply with all laws, in all our markets, at all times and obviously reject immediately any suggestion we are in any way responsible for the tragic deaths of community members. Fresnillo employees themselves have been victim of continued inter-community violence. More specifically, Fresnillo has complied fully with the court order and as a result, vacated 1,824 hectares of land, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos since 2013.'", "b98191e5b42c6a13d4229de8ae18579d243d85045897d807b4599270": "Two of Wisconsin's presidential electors and a voter in the state filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to punish a group of Republicans who tried to cast fake electoral votes for Donald Trump in 2020, asking a state court to order them to pay up to $2.4m collectively in damages and bar them from ever serving as legitimate electors in a presidential election. Wisconsin was one of seven states Trump lost in 2020 where allies cast an alternative set of electoral votes as part of his effort to overturn the election. The suit, filed by Law Forward and the Georgetown Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection (Icap) on behalf of the legitimate electors, is the first of its kind seeking civil punishments against the electors. Federal prosecutors and the January 6 commission are reportedly also reviewing the fake slates. The lawsuit, filed in Dane county, targets the 10 Republicans who served as the fake elector slate, as well as Jim Troupis, an attorney for the Trump campaign in Wisconsin, and Kenneth Chesebro, a Boston-area attorney who aided their efforts. It asks a judge to order each of them to pay a $2,000 fine as well as up to $200,000 each in damages in addition to blocking them from ever being able to serve as electors. 'Although Defendants were unsuccessful in having their fake ballots counted, they caused significant harm simply by trying, and there is every reason to believe that they will try again if given the opportunity,' the complaint says. 'Defendants actions also violated a host of state and federal laws. Thus far, however, none of the fraudulent electors has been held accountable. This lawsuit seeks to change that.' Chesebro sent Troupis a memo in November 2020, two weeks after election day, laying out the rationale for why alternate slates of electors should meet and cast votes for Trump in states he lost. 'It may seem odd that the electors pledged to Trump and [Vice-President Mike] Pence might meet and cast their votes, even if, at that juncture, the Trump-Pence ticket is behind in the vote count,' he wrote in the memo. 'However, a fair reading of the federal statutes suggests that this is a reasonable course of action.' The Trump campaign endorsed the effort and electors in Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and New Mexico all met on 14 December 2020, the day the electoral college met, to cast their votes for Trump. They sent certificates of their votes to the National Archives in Washington. 'Their fraudulently submitted electoral votes fed into the false narrative that was relied on by those who violently attacked the US Capitol on January 6, halting the counting of the legitimate Electoral College votes,' Mary McCord, executive director of Icap said in a statement. 'As important as it is that we hold accountable those responsible for that attack, it's just as vital that we demand accountability for those whose fraudulent activity undermined the electoral process and weakened our democracy.' In March, the Wisconsin Elections Commission, the six-member body that oversees elections in the state, unanimously voted to reject a complaint against the fake electors alleging they broke state law. The commission relied on an analysis from the Wisconsin Department of Justice finding that the electors didn't run afoul of state statutes and were trying to keep their legal options open, according to WisPolitics.com. Law Forward, one of the groups behind Tuesday's lawsuit, also backed that complaint. The Wisconsin case is the latest in a number of cases filed across the US over the last year seeking to hold people who aided efforts to overturn the election accountable. Two election workers in Georgia, for example, recently reached a settlement in a defamation suit with One America News (OAN), which falsely accused the pair of counting illegal ballots. The network said shortly after the settlement there was 'no widespread voter fraud.' Dominion, the voting machine company targeted by election conspiracy theorists, has also filed a number of defamation lawsuits. Other groups have sought sanctions against Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani, and other lawyers who promoted Trump's baseless conspiracies about the election.", "4b441c8e275e788524a834bfc7f682edfe2f3add0d05567d1b64327d": "The founder of a violent neo-Nazi group created to inspire a race war in the UK is facing jail after being found guilty of continuing to be a member of the organisation after it was banned. Alex Davies, 27, who was described in court as the 'biggest Nazi of the lot', formed the group National Action (NA) when he was a teenager and acted as its main recruiter. Members of NA armed themselves with machetes, swords, firearms and crossbows as they plotted 'white jihad' across the UK. One man associated with the group was jailed for planning to kill an MP and another was in close contact with a man imprisoned for a racist machete attack on an Asian dentist. Other members took part in provocative rallies up and down the country, dressed in black, delivering Nazi-style salutes and carrying flags with slogans such as 'Hitler was right'. Davies, from Swansea, south Wales, caused outrage in 2016 when he posed holding an NA flag and giving the Nazi salute in the execution chamber of the Buchenwald concentration camp. NA was banned in December 2016 after posting 'congratulatory' tweets after the murder of the MP Jo Cox, becoming the first far-right group to be proscribed in the UK since the second world war. But Winchester crown court heard that Davies set up the 'continuity group' NS131 - National Socialist Anti-Capitalist Action - to try to circumvent the ban. Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, told the jury that NS131 used the same Nazi imagery as NA and had the same Nazi ideology. He said: 'Who was at the centre of all this? The founder, the galvaniser, the recruiter, one Alex Davies. He was probably the biggest Nazi of the lot. The defendant was an extremist's extremist.' Davies told the court he was not a violent person - though he was pictured taking part in paramilitary training camps - but admitted his aim was for the repatriation of black, Asian and minority ethnic and Jewish people from the UK, except for those doing 'essential' jobs. Asked in court if he was a neo-Nazi, Davies replied: 'Sure.' Davies, the son of an engineer and a kitchen worker, founded NA with Benjamin Raymond, a Wiltshire artist and the group's 'roving ambassador' who forged links with extremists across Europe and the US. Others associated with NA include Jack Renshaw, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, who admitted preparing an act of terrorism by buying a machete to kill the West Lancashire MP Rosie Cooper. Raymond was in close contact with a neo-Nazi called Zack Davies shortly before Davies attacked an Asian dentist in a supermarket in north Wales with a machete. Among those convicted of membership have been Mikko Vehvilainen, a British soldier and Afghanistan veteran, and Ben Hannam, a former Met police probationary officer. Supt Anthony Tagg, the head of the West Midlands' counter-terrorism unit, which led the investigation, said: 'National Action were incredibly dangerous, and the ideology they espoused was an ideology of hatred, which caused division in communities across the country. 'They sought to identify individuals in what they considered to be positions of authority; within the British army, within policing. They sought to utilise those positions to further their ideological cause.' Davies is the 19th member of the group to be convicted, and Tagg said he believed it had now been dismantled. At its peak NA is estimated to have had 100 members. It was discovered by chance when security guards at Aston University in Birmingham spotted stickers with hate messages and called local police, who referred it on to counter-terrorism specialists. Judge Mark Dennis QC said Davies would be sentenced on 7 June at the Old Bailey. He said: 'The defendant must appreciate it's inevitable a custodial sentence will follow.'", "79b8c4407a38c18b43bfe5f5bf0006ef1111e2af13fa63e698229a11": "The US Congress held its first open briefing on UFOs in more than 50 years on Tuesday, but those seeking explanations for the numerous military sightings of unexplained objects were left disappointed, as defense officials appeared to hold their juiciest information for closed door hearings. During a 90-minute briefing in Washington a highlight was the release of two new videos showing unidentified aerial phenomena, although one of them was immediately debunked by Scott Bray, the deputy director of navy intelligence. The hearing, the first of its nature since 1966, came after a bumper year for UFO enthusiasts. In 2021, US intelligence released a landmark report which found 144 reports of unidentified aerial phenomenon, only one of which could be explained. The report followed US navy pilots publicly discussing their encounters with UAPs, with one retired lieutenant claiming he saw objects in the sky above the east coast 'every day for at least a couple years'. On Tuesday Bray sought to defend the government's investigation of UAPs - following accusations that the Pentagon is not taking the issue seriously enough - but also showed members of an intelligence subcommittee videos of airborne objects. One video, filmed during daylight, showed an object appearing to whiz past a military jet. The fleeting appearance of the object - it appeared on screen for less than a second - showed the difficulty in gathering data on some UAPs, Bray said. Another clip, recorded at night from a military plane at some time in 2019, showed triangle shapes appearing to hover in the sky. Bray then played another video that captured the same phenomena, but followed it up with a mundane explanation: the objects were drones, rendered triangular in shape and other-worldly in motion because of a quirk in the way video was captured through night-vision equipment. The debunking did little to counter accusations - including one leveled by Andre Carson, the committee chair - that the Pentagon has little interest in investigating the inexplicable. 'One of Congress's concerns is that the executive branch, the administration, both parties, have been sweeping concerns about UAPs under the rug by focusing on events that can be explained, and avoiding them that cannot be explained,' Carson, a Democratic congressman from Indiana said. 'What can you say to give the American people confidence that you aren't just focusing our attention on low-hanging fruit, the easy explanations?' The line of questioning followed concerns that while the Pentagon has established a UAP office - the bureaucratically titled Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group - research in this field is still far from a top priority. Bray acknowledged the intelligence community had 'had to sometimes be less forthcoming with information', adding, 'we do not want potential adversaries to know exactly what we're able to see or understand or how we come to the conclusion.' The answer revealed an attitude that has long frustrated those seeking fuller disclosure - and has prompted a range of conspiracy theories about what the government may be hiding. Bray and Ronald Moultrie, the defense under secretary for intelligence and security, soon provided an example of that aversion to disclosure, when asked if the Pentagon has 'any sensors underwater to detect on submerged UAPs - anything that is in the ocean or the seas'. 'I think that would be more appropriately addressed in closed session,' Moultrie said. While nuggets of new information remained infuriatingly rare, Bray did report that the intelligence community has 'seen an increasing number of unauthorized and or unidentified aircraft or objects', which he attributed to destigmatizing military reporting of encounters and the use of new detection systems. The 2021 report acknowledged sightings of UAPs that 'appeared to remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly, or move at considerable speed, without discernible means of propulsion', and on Tuesday Bray ruled out a foreign adversary possessing such technology. Some politicians have openly expressed dissatisfaction with the progress of the new UAP office - which less than a month from its start date has yet to appoint a director - with an aide to Kirsten Gillibrand, the US senator from New York, telling Politico in May: 'Senator Gillibrand believes that the [department of defense] needs to take this issue much more seriously and get in motion.' The dissatisfaction is a far cry from the optimism that surrounded the government when it released its report in 2021. At the time amateur UAP organizations had hoped that the Pentagon would be more open in sharing its own data and more willing to examine videos and images recorded by amateur investigators. Moultrie made it clear, however, that this would not be the case, when he suggested that some groups 'are putting information out there that could be considered to be somewhat self serving'. As Carson brought the hearing to a close he noted to his Democratic and Republican colleagues that the topic of 'UAPs and UFOs' is 'one of the few times we can demonstrate some degree of bipartisanship'. For the watching public, however, it was clear that the briefing had mostly raised more questions - and frustration - than answers. As before, humans remain no closer to finding out whether alien life is out there. Alejandro Rojas, a researcher at Enigma Labs, an analytics and community platform for UFOs and a board member at the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies, tweeted: '[The hearing was] mostly a cordial conversation about how great AIMSOG will be one day. 'We got some answers, but I have much less confidence in AIMSOG as I did before the hearing.'", "482bf3c0040aa65af1c55856d400fc0a7e676a7650cce59c18bc970b": "", "7fc1a26c190593c1cce73d5331220ab904ad37f4889ef044b27172e9": "Mastercard is rolling out a controversial programme that will allow shoppers to pay at the till with a mere smile or wave of the hand, as it tries to secure a slice of the $18bn (PS14.4bn) biometrics market. While face recognition technology has long raised eyebrows among civil rights groups, the payments giant said it was pushing ahead with a biometric checkout programme it claimed would speed up payments, cut queues and provide more security than a standard credit or debit card. 'Once enrolled, there is no need to slow down the checkout queue searching through their pockets or bag,' Mastercard said. 'Consumers can simply check the bill and smile into a camera or wave their hand over a reader to pay.' Mastercard also claimed the new payment system would be more hygienic, tapping into health concerns that came to the fore in the Covid pandemic. The first pilots will launch in Brazil at five St Marche supermarkets in Sao Paulo, this week, with shoppers able to register for biometric payments in store or via an app with their local partner, Payface. A spokesperson for Mastercard said a UK rollout was part of its 'near-term plan', and that the company was having 'encouraging conversations with potential partners'. In the meantime, it will focus on launching the technology in markets including Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The scheme is part of Mastercard's efforts to enter the contactless biometrics technology market, which is expected to be worth $18.6bn by 2026, according to data by KBV Research. The payments giant is competing with big tech rivals such as Amazon, which has used palm readers at its stores, which have attracted criticism from US politicians due to data privacy concerns. Mastercard pointed to research suggesting that 74% of global consumers had a 'positive attitude' towards biometric technology, though activists have long raised concerns over data storage and tracking. Suzie Miles, a partner at lawfirm Ashfords said: 'Mastercard themselves have recognised the data and security concerns that come with the use of biometrics. A password can be changed, your smile and wave can not. If biometric data is hacked then the risk of fraudulent activity could be considerably higher than current payment methods.' There are also debates about how the data could be used to track, screen or monitor unsuspecting consumers. 'While it seems Mastercard have taken steps to protect and encrypt this data, as biometric payments become more commonplace the use of such data is likely to evolve and it will inevitably become harder to protect individuals rights to privacy,' Miles said.", "93cc9b369f9098300a1f5be4a85b5a6fb9b9fb1df30aaba472bb12bf": "The Queen has marked the completion of London's Crossrail project by attending the opening ceremony of the Elizabeth line. Accompanied by the Earl of Wessex, she was welcomed by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the commissioner of Transport for London, Andy Byford, at Paddington station. Using a walking stick, the Queen smiled as she met staff who have been key to the project and who will run the railway, including train drivers, station workers and apprentices. She was given an Oyster card and shown how to use it on a ticket machine. She walked slowly as she made her way around the station concourse. The Queen unveiled a plaque stating that she 'officially opened' the Elizabeth line and spent 10 minutes in the station before leaving in a lift. Johnson told guests: 'We're all incredibly touched and moved and grateful to Her Majesty for coming to open the Elizabeth line today. It was fantastic to see her.' It was a rare public engagement for the 96-year-old monarch, who missed the state opening of parliament last week. Announcing the Queen's intention to be at the ceremony, Buckingham Palace said: 'In a happy development, Her Majesty the Queen is attending today's event to mark the completion of the Elizabeth line. Her Majesty was aware of the engagement and the organisers were informed of the possibility she may attend.' The engagement is the Queen's first outside the Windsor area since she attended the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service in Westminster Abbey seven weeks ago. Kofi Duah, an Elizabeth line customer experience assistant, said he was 'thrilled' to present an Oyster card to the Queen and show her how it could be topped up on a machine. The Queen did not top up the card, which was preloaded with PS5 of credit. He said: 'I gave her an Oyster card and told her she can tap it on the yellow reader. I showed her the current balance and how to top up the Oyster. 'She said, 'Where can I use it?'. I said, 'You can use it across our line, so from Paddington to Abbey Wood. She said, 'Oh nice, splendid'.'  The Elizabeth line, named in the Queen's honour, will open to passengers on 24 May. It was hoped the head of state would be involved in the opening ceremony but her attendance was not guaranteed as she has missed a number of big events this year owing to mobility problems. She made a trip to the Royal Windsor horse show on Friday, and on Sunday was the guest of honour at the equestrian show A Gallop Through History near Windsor, the first big event of the jubilee festivities. Crossrail, the name of the project to build the new east-west railway, was delayed and over budget because of numerous problems, including construction difficulties and complications installing signalling systems. It was due to be completed in December 2018 and was set a budget of PS14.8bn in 2010. The total cost has been estimated at PS18.9bn, including PS5.1bn from the government. The Elizabeth line will boost capacity and cut journey times across the capital. It will stretch from Reading in Berkshire and Heathrow airport in west London to Shenfield in Essex and Abbey Wood in south-east London. Trains will initially operate in three sections, which are expected to be integrated in the autumn.", "d70e95ee3b2510b83ec6bc9387f58bc3e988c238e3a813d8885b580a": "A gunman motivated by hatred against Taiwan chained shut the doors of a California church and hid firebombs before shooting at a gathering of mostly elderly Taiwanese parishioners, killing a man who tackled him, authorities said. David Chou, 68, of Las Vegas, a US citizen who authorities say grew up in Taiwan, drove to Orange county on Saturday and the next day attended a lunch held by Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian church, which worships at Geneva Presbyterian church in the community of Laguna Woods. Though he knew no one there, he spent about an hour mingling with about 40 attendees and then executed his plot, authorities said at a news conference. Chou chained the doors and put super glue in the keyholes, according to authorities. He had two 9mm handguns - legally purchased years ago in Las Vegas - and three bags, containing among other things four molotov cocktail-type incendiary devices and extra ammunition. He opened fire and in the ensuing chaos Dr John Cheng, 52, tackled him, allowing other parishioners to subdue him and tie him up with extension cords. Cheng died and five people were wounded, the oldest 92. Sheriff Don Barnes called Cheng's heroism 'a meeting of good versus evil' that probably saved the lives 'of upwards of dozens of people'.  Prosecutors on Tuesday charged Chou with one count of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder. Todd Spitzer, the Orange county district attorney, also announced that Chou faces an enhancement for 'lying in wait' as well as four counts of possessing destructive devices with intent to kill or harm. Chou's arraignment is expected later Tuesday. 'We typically think of the person who hides in the bushes,' Spitzer said. 'This case is about the person concealing themselves in plain view.' It was not immediately clear whether Chou had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. A federal hate crimes investigation is also ongoing. If convicted as charged and a jury finds the enhancements to be true, Chou would face a sentence of either life in prison without possibility of parole or the death penalty, Spitzer said. Chou had worked as a security guard in Las Vegas, authorities said. There was no immediate word on why Chou chose to target the church in Laguna Woods, a scenic coastal area about 50 miles south-east of Los Angeles whose population mainly consists of retirees and is near a large gated community. Barnes said the motive for the shooting was Chou's hatred toward Taiwan that was documented in handwritten notes that authorities found. Chou's family apparently was among many forcibly removed from mainland China to Taiwan some time after 1948, Spitzer said earlier this week. Relations between mainlanders forced to flee a communist takeover and native Taiwanese were frequently tense as the new arrivals crowded into slums and military communities. Separated by language and lifestyle, bullying and confrontation were frequent as President Chiang Kai-shek tightly restricted civil liberties under nearly four decades of martial law. The Presbyterian church is the most prominent of the Christian denominations in Taiwan and was closely identified with the pro-democracy movement during the martial law era and later with the Taiwan independence cause. Barnes referred to Chou as an immigrant from China but Taiwan's Central News Agency says it interviewed Louis M Huang, director general of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Los Angeles, and he confirmed that Chou was born in Taiwan in 1953. Taiwanese media also said Chou had ties to an organization opposed to Taiwan's independence from China. Barnes said Chou acted alone and was 'not believed to be associated with any specific church or any religion, and there's no direct connection to the church or any member of the church that we're aware of'. Balmore Orellana, a former neighbor, said Chou's life unraveled after his wife left him last year and moved to Taiwan. Before, Chou had been a pleasant man who used to own the Las Vegas apartment building where he lived until February, Orellana told the Associated Press. Chou also received a head injury and other serious injuries in an attack by a tenant, the neighbor said. Last summer, a gun was fired inside Chou's apartment and the bullet entered Orellana's apartment, although nobody was hurt, Orellana said. Police reports about the assault and the shooting were not immediately available on Monday. Tensions between China and Taiwan are at the highest in decades, with Beijing stepping up its military harassment by flying fighter jets toward the self-governing island. China has not ruled out force to reunify with Taiwan, which split from the mainland during a civil war in 1949. Taiwan's president has condemned the deadly shooting. Taiwan's chief representative in the US, Bi-khim Hsiao, offered condolences on Twitter. 'I join the families of the victims and Taiwanese American communities in grief and pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded survivors,' Hsiao wrote on Sunday. A Chinese embassy spokesperson, Liu Pengyu, told the AP via email that the Chinese government has 'consistently condemned incidents of violence. We express our condolences to the victims and sincere sympathy to the bereaved families and the injured.' Those wounded by gunshots included an 86-year-old woman as well as four men, ages 66, 75, 82 and 92, the sheriff's department said. Authorities on Monday said two of the wounded were in good condition, two were in stable condition and the status of the fifth patient was undetermined. Jerry Chen, a longtime member of the church, said about 40 congregants had gathered in the fellowship hall for a luncheon after a morning service to welcome their former Pastor Billy Chang, a beloved and respected community member who had served the church for 20 years. Chang moved back to Taiwan two years ago. This was his first time back stateside, Chen said. Barnes said Cheng, a sports medicine doctor who is survived by a wife and two children, charged at the shooter and attempted to disarm him, allowing others to intervene. Chang hit the gunman on the head with a chair before other parishioners subdued him.", "eebae3c67d3ea63c97063e1a6162dcfdfee7aecc1bcbc6b7761238ec": "", "0522f482eaa22a14fbed0c60b2165e8fa0a10d13294276fafb1f3c4e": "", "d970c968c8a76002deac7423e6a48142fcd89fa868b1ac4e51d73bc1": "", "fd259ac719f6d8bea46fbb06653c7404a7957fa522a8156f0cba45ab": "", "f9cda4a6557abc1b573f0e434335e048c9aea91b612a9586a515dc67": "", "b9a106fca35ecb2efee356531af5798be412b2733778ebd278932568": "Lacy Hollings watched the billowing black smoke rise a hundred feet from her door and sensed a disaster waiting to happen. It was 2006, and she had been deployed to the Ghazi province in Afghanistan as an interrogator and linguist with the United States army. Every day, the dark cloud lingered, stinging her eyes, charring her lungs, and making it difficult to breathe. What Hollings was seeing was a burn pit, an area roughly the size of a basketball court where all the waste from the base - human sewage, food, tires and metal - was discarded, doused in fuel, and then set on fire with a match. It had a pungently chemical smell and would sizzle and crackle.  The smoke lingered for months, making Hollings's one-mile runs around the base increasingly unpleasant. She knew there was no way she could live so close to the burn pit and not go home sick, referring to it among friends as 'a ticking timebomb'. Dark soot would spray into her tissue whenever she blew her nose, an ominous sign that the smoke had entered her body. And indeed, only a year after she returned home she discovered her first of five cancerous tumors. Congress has finally recognized the dangers of burn pit exposure in the form of the Honoring Our Pact Act, a sweeping bipartisan bill that passed the House on 3 March 2022. The bill extends healthcare to 3.5 million veterans affected by burn pit exposure, but it has yet to become law and will only protect veterans with 23 registered conditions. For female veterans like Hollings, who make up about 17% of the US military, their exposure symptoms are often outside this list. And even in cases when they are included - like that of Catherine O'Connors, who deployed to Iraq with the marines in 2005 - it can take female veterans years to access the benefits they deserve. 'This is just another instance where women veterans are not acknowledged for their specific needs within the system,' said Jennifer Pacanowski, founder of the non-profit Women Veterans Empowered and Thriving. 'Or, where their service-connected disabilities are not associated with where they were stationed.' Rosie Torres, the founder of BurnPits360, an organization that supports veterans suffering from toxic exposure and who worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs for 23 years, says that even though the VA is a government administration, it could do more to help. 'I can't even imagine what veterans outside the system are going through against the bureaucracy within,' Torres said. 'Even if they pass the Honor Our Pact, we will be adding illnesses to our list and calling on Congress to make these changes.' When Hollings was told in the Bay Pines VA medical center in March 2021 that she needed yet another surgery, she felt nothing. A frank, unemotive voice in her head intoned, 'OK, great, another tumor, where's it at this time?' as her collected, outward self agreed to have the operation on 4 April. This was the fifth serious health problem Hollings had since returning from Afghanistan in 2007 at the age of 27. The first was an ovarian cyst, the size of a softball, which was removed during her pregnancy. The next was a melanoma on her back, then came a parathyroid tumor, a rare growth in the four glands located around her neck. And finally, two blood clots the size of golf balls, the most recent of which Hollings was treated for last year. 'I know I am going to keep on finding tumors,' she said. 'It's just a matter of time until I find one too late.' When Hollings graduated from the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, at 21, she was excited to join the army and put her years of linguistic training to good use. Although frustrated at being assigned to Afghanistan, where she couldn't practice Arabic, she quickly fell in love with the place and the people. Her optimism waned, however, when it was time to return to Indiana and deal with the arduous VA disability services. As advised, Hollings claimed everything she could, noting the mental health problems she suffered as well as her exposure to burn pits, which she thought would lead to later health complications. She heard nothing for a year. Then she received a denial for the burn pit-related problems. She was given no chance to talk to anybody or get an explanation for her case. Several times, she tried arguing on the phone, saying: 'Look, these burn pits have caused these issues, caused my fibromyalgia. Here is the documentation, and here is why.' Yet Hollings remembers the disability services responding, 'Absolutely, you have these conditions; absolutely, they are disabling and terrifying. But there is no connection between these illnesses and burn pit exposure.' Hollings does receive medical compensation for depressive disorder and chronic hip pain but says the VA still refuses to consider or acknowledge the causes of her other conditions. Now that her tumors have been removed, she says it is no longer considered a problem to the VA. But if she could get one more chance to talk to them again, she would say, 'Quit dodging the bullet; it happened, do the right thing and pay for our injuries.' On 12 March 2022, Catherine O'Connor left the Memorial Sloan Kettering cancer hospital on New York's Upper East Side and walked into Central Park with her yellow labrador. Her clothes were her usual, old, even - boots, sweatpants and a waterproof green jacket - but the scar that ran along her neck, visible still under the shadow of her chin, was new. As was the swelling of her right cheek caused by the operation she had just undergone. O'Connor deployed to Iraq aged 20 as a cyber networks operator in the Marine Corps. Those days, the military seemed unconcerned about the toxicity of setting carcinogens on fire. Her job was to make sure that no one was stealing from the burn pits at the Al Asad airbase in which she was living, and where sensitive documents were destroyed. For 12 hours a day, O'Connor would drive around the vicinity, making sure no one stole from the dump. To the best of her memory, she remembers thinking this couldn't be good for her. 'At 20, though,' she said, 'everyone feels invincible.' It wasn't until O'Connor returned home in 2006 to continue her studies that she began to think about the consequences of living near the burn pits. Fourteen years later, there were repercussions. In November 2021, O'Connor started feeling pain in her ear, as if she had been punched. When she went to a doctor, he said her ears were fine, but there was a lump in the back of her mouth that needed attention. A biopsy revealed salivary gland cancer, common only in people above 60. O'Connor was 38. 'This is incredibly surprising,' said the oral surgeon.  O'Connor spent entire days on hold with the VA, trying to figure out whom to talk to or how to move forward. Luckily, as she worked as a lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, the firm covered her medical bills. When she checked in for treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering, one of the best cancer hospitals in the world, O'Connor asked her surgeon about the burn pit connection. The Honor Our Pact legislation had been in the media frequently, and she wanted an expert opinion. 'Environmental exposure may entirely be the cause,' he responded. 'There is no hereditary explanation for your cancer.' Surprisingly, his answer helped O'Connor cope with her condition. 'There's a feeling of 'what did I do wrong?' that comes with getting cancer,' she said. 'The randomness of my diagnoses seemed so unfair, but knowing there could be a cause made me feel better.' While O'Connor's cancer was slow-growing, she often wishes she had found it earlier. The surgery took 12 hours, with the surgeon taking grafts from her hip and arm. 'This could have been avoided' is a thought that often tortures her. 'While I know the science is just not there yet to confirm, I think if I could turn back time, and you could tell me that conclusively and absolutely that my condition was linked to my exposure, I would not have deployed.'", "466f50c542f4d9e591fee4c8d878e152648a94ce187ef9fb6474be01": "It was grimly poignant that the first Black person to hold a briefing as White House press secretary should begin by naming victims of white supremacist violence. Karine Jean-Pierre, standing at the famed blue lectern, took a moment to 'remember lives lost and forever changed in Buffalo' with brief and evocative biographies of the 10 victims of Saturday's mass shooting in New York state. Evidently, whereas Joe Biden's first press secretary, Jen Psaki, could ride a wave of optimism at the start of a new administration - and benefit by comparison to Donald Trump's mendacious messengers - Jean-Pierre is inheriting a world of trouble. Her 64-minute debut on Monday ranged from Buffalo to baby formula, from Somalia to Ukraine, but first she used her opening remarks to reflect on the new chapter of White House history she was writing. 'I am a Black, gay, immigrant woman,' said Jean-Pierre, born in Martinique to Haitian parents and raised in New York. 'The first of all three of those to hold this position. I would not be here today if it were not for generations of barrier-breaking people before me. I stand on their shoulders.' Expressing gratitude to the sacrifices those who came before her, the 47-year-old added: 'Representation does matter. You hear us say this often in this administration, and no one understands this better than President Biden.' Biden, she would go on to remind the briefing more than once, had been motivated to run for president by white nationalists clashing with civil rights activists in Charlottesville, Virginia, nearly five years ago. And it surely did mean something that, whereas Trump had told the media there were very fine people on both sides, and had been defended by a white press secretary, Sarah Sanders, here was a Black press secretary insisting that hate will have no safe harbour. Composed and genial, Jean-Pierre was successful in observing the first rule of media briefings - do no harm - but did appear a little too cautious on one point. She was repeatedly asked if she would 'call out' individuals such as Fox News host Tucker Carlson or Republican members of Congress who fan the flames of extremism and the 'great replacement' theory. Time and again she refused. 'It doesn't matter who it is,' she insisted. 'If a person espouses hatred, we need to call that out. I'm not going to get a back and forth on names and who said what.' One reporter asked if Biden sees a connection to Trump's 'ultra-Maga' movement. Again she dodged. When the press secretary said, 'We're not going to get into politics here,' another journalist loudly objected that this seemed to be letting the culprits off the hook. Jean-Pierre protested that Biden had always condemned hate: 'Once you get into calling out people's names then you move away from that issue.' Critics will say the Biden administration is pulling its punches. How can the scourge of white supremacy, which the president describes as a stain on the soul of America, be addressed if he will not identify its tribunes? Is Biden, once again, living in a sepia-tinted age of bipartisanship? Jean-Pierre's reticence was thrown into sharp relief down Pennsylvania Avenue where Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, did name names. 'In a craven quest for viewers and ratings, organisations such as Fox News have spent years perfecting the craft of stoking cultural grievance and political resentment that eerily mirrors the messages found in replacement theory. 'According to one measure by the New York Times, Fox's top political pundit - most widely watched - Tucker Carlson, has spewed rhetoric that echoes replacement theory at least 400 times on his show since 2016.' The contrast was illustrative: the job of White House press secretary is often about ducking controversies and not making headlines. Psaki was masterful at promising to 'circle back' and 'not get ahead of the president'. Now, like the TV time traveller Doctor Who, the press secretary has regenerated in different and diverse form but with essentially the same character. Devoted Psaki fans might gripe that Jean-Pierre, who entered 38 minutes late with a smile and a briefing book under her arm, has not yet got the knack of riffing spontaneously. For example, Psaki's tussles with Peter Doocy of Fox News would sometimes go viral when she delivered an off-the cuff '#Psakibomb'. When Doocy challenged Jean-Pierre on Monday, she did not seem quite so nimble. He noted that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos had criticised Biden for a tweet the president wrote suggesting that taxing wealthier corporations could help bring down inflation. Jean-Pierre read from her notes: 'Look, it's not a huge mystery why one of the wealthiest individuals on Earth, right, opposes an economic agenda that is for the middle class, that cuts some of the biggest costs families face, fights inflation for the long haul, right ...' It went on in wonky fashion. But Monday will be remembered as the day that Jean-Pierre shattered multiple glass ceilings. Asked to reflect on her history making role, she said she had not read many of the things written about her. 'But there was something that moved me,' she said, referring to a media story about her elementary school in Hempstead, New York. 'They talked to the students about me and this moment and this administration ... and these kids wrote me a letter and, in the letter, they talked about how they can dream bigger because of me standing behind this podium. And that matters.'", "5017f52071326347587924251c157a0e86e587ec7b86625b7595e706": "", "88ab0870916a32b6a4ee48d8004b407875b174a27da5ada533c10f20": "", "2e3578edbf8af2087134b25c9246b9f69d6ded85cea652a1014d3a37": "", "8e110be9b8038f2dbe7be17a71f3a0764bcae139a5cd726fc7bdc2cb": "Joe Biden attacked the 'hateful and perverse ideology' behind the Buffalo massacre as he and first lady Jill Biden visited the city and paid tribute to the victims. In an emotional but powerful address to mourners, officials and first responders, the president called on Americans to 'enlist' in the fight against racial hatred: Biden condemned years of racially-based attacks across the country. We're closing our live blog now, but it's far from the end of our political coverage for the day. It's primary day in several states, with prominent Republican Senate and governor candidates in Pennsylvania notably going head to head. Please watch for my colleague Lauren Gambino's coverage later, including TV doctor Mehmet Oz's bid to advance his chase for a Senate seat and North Carolina extremist Madison Cawthorn's efforts to hold on to his in the House of Representatives. The day was otherwise dominated by Joe Biden's visit to grieve with the families of victims and survivors of the weekend's massacre of 10 people at a grocery store in Buffalo. 'Evil will not win. Hate will not prevail,' Biden said, calling white supremacy 'a poison' that had no place in America.  Here's what else we followed: Donald Trump has received a savage Twitter smackdown from George Conway, a constant bete noire of the former president as co-founder of the Lincoln Project, and husband to his former adviser Kellyanne Conway. The Tuesday afternoon insult likening Trump to a caged monkey throwing feces came as part of a chain that began with news the 6 January committee was not expecting to call him as a witness in public hearings this spring. Lawyer Elizabeth de la Vega decided it was not something she wanted to see: And Conway followed up with this: Thousands of ballots from several counties in today's Pennsylvania primary election might not be able to be read 'for several days', the Associated Press reports, because of a printing error. Officials in Lancaster county, the state's sixth most populous, said the problem involved at least 21,000 mailed ballots, only a third of which were scanning properly.  The glitch will force election workers to redo ballots that can't be read by the machine, a laborious process expected to take several days, the AP says. Officials in the Republican-controlled county pledged that all the ballots will be counted eventually. 'Citizens deserve to have accurate results from elections and they deserve to have them on election night, not days later,' Josh Parsons, Republican vice chair of the county board of commissioners said at a news conference.  'But because of this, we're not going to have final election results from these mail ballots for probably several days'.  John Fetterman, frontrunner in today's Democratic senate primary in Pennsylvania, is undergoing what campaign staff say is 'a standard procedure' to install a heart pacemaker. The state's lieutenant governor announced on Sunday he had suffered a minor stroke two days previously, but said he was recovering and his campaign 'isn't slowing down one bit'. 'John Fetterman is about to undergo a standard procedure to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator. It should be a short procedure that will help protect his heart and address the underlying cause of his stroke, atrial fibrillation (A-fib), by regulating his heart rate and rhythm,' the statement from his campaign said. Fetterman tweeted that he used 'an emergency absentee ballot' to cast his vote today (presumably for himself) from his bed in Penn Medicine Lancaster general hospital. Buffalo's mayor Byron Brown has just been talking about Joe Biden's visit to his city today, and what he sees as the president's 'sense of resolve' to get something done about gun reforms following the grocery store massacre. Brown told reporters that the president and first lady Jill Biden spent considerable private time with the families of the 10 killed by an alleged white supremacist, which he said he thought strengthened Biden's 'commitment to try to bring change': Brown also paid tribute to police officers and fire fighters who responded to Saturday's shooting, and credited Aaron Salter, the former police officer and Tops market security guard who lost his life in a firefight with the killer, for saving lives: The US Congress held its first open briefing on UFOs in more than 50 years on Tuesday, but those seeking explanations for the numerous military sightings of unexplained objects were left disappointed, as defense officials appeared to hold their juiciest information for closed door hearings. During a 90-minute briefing in Washington a highlight was the release of two new videos showing unidentified aerial phenomena, although one of them was immediately debunked by Scott Bray, the deputy director of navy intelligence. The hearing, the first of its nature since 1966, came after a bumper year for UFO enthusiasts. In 2021, US intelligence released a landmark report which found 144 reports of unidentified aerial phenomenon, only one of which could be explained. The report followed US navy pilots publicly discussing their encounters with UAPs, with one retired lieutenant claiming he saw objects in the sky above the east coast 'every day for at least a couple years'. On Tuesday Bray sought to defend the government's investigation of UAPs - following accusations that the Pentagon is not taking the issue seriously enough - but also showed members of an intelligence subcommittee videos of airborne objects. One video, filmed during daylight, showed an object appearing to whiz past a military jet. The fleeting appearance of the object - it appeared on screen for less than a second - showed the difficulty in gathering data on some UAPs, Bray said. Another clip, recorded at night from a military plane at some time in 2019, showed triangle shapes appearing to hover in the sky. Bray then played another video that captured the same phenomena, but followed it up with a mundane explanation: the objects were drones, rendered triangular in shape and other-worldly in motion because of a quirk in the way video was captured through night-vision equipment. The debunking did little to counter accusations - including one leveled by Andre Carson, the committee chair - that the Pentagon has little interest in investigating the inexplicable.

It moved to secure the properties Tuesday, according to the Associated Press, after determining Afghanistan 'formally ceased conducting diplomatic and consular activities in the United States' at noon yesterday. In reality, there have been no formal diplomatic ties between Washington and Kabul since the Taliban assumed power after the chaotic US withdrawal last summer. The US does not recognize the Taliban as a legitime government. An official notice will be published in the federal register on Wednesday stating that the department had assumed responsibility for 'protection and preservation' of the properties the AP said. Nobody will be allowed to enter the buildings without state department official, it said. The day has been dominated so far by Joe Biden's visit to grieve with the families of victims and survivors of the weekend's massacre of 10 people at a grocery store in Buffalo. The president and first lady Jill Biden met with the families, then he delivered a powerful address in which he called out the racial hatred behind the killings, and urged Americans to unite in the fight against 'hateful and perverse ideology'. 'Evil will not win. Hate will not prevail,' Biden said, calling white supremacy 'a poison' that had no place in America. Elsewhere: Republicans in Wisconsin who attempted to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 victory in the state, by submitting false electoral ballots to Congress declaring Donald Trump the winner, are facing a lawsuit. The legal action in Dane county circuit court says the decision by a Republican slate of electors to send the ballots saying Trump had won was 'as legally baseless as it was repugnant to democracy', the Associated Press says.  Biden won the state, and its 10 electoral college votes, by almost 21,000 votes.  The lawsuit, filed by three Democratic voters, names 10 Republicans and two attorneys it says were responsible and seeks up to $2.4m in damages, as well as disqualifying the Republicans from serving as electors in the future. 'It's essential to have accountability and to make sure this doesn't happen again,' Jeffrey Mandell, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told the AP. 'We have heard in the more than a year since the fraudulent electors met the excuse that what they did was not wrong, it was totally fine. We want a court to make clear that is not true'. Republican electors who have spoken publicly have argued they weren't trying to change the Wisconsin result but attempting to 'preserve legal options' if a court ruled in favor of Trump. Wisconsin was among a number of heavily contested swing states that Biden won to deny Trump a second term in office.  The twice-impeached Trump has since expounded the big lie that the election was fraudulent and victory was stolen from him, and incited the 6 January Capitol riot by his supporters to try to cling on to power. Numerous conservative groups pushing the big lie are facing legal actions is several states, the Guardian reported last week.

An emotional Joe Biden, who received several bursts of applause during his Buffalo address, closed with a powerful call for Americans to come together to defeat what he said was a 'hateful minority': And he widened his comments to include the divisiveness of the current political climate: The president said Americans had a duty to call out the hatred and racial bigotry behind the massacre in Buffalo, and countless other mass shootings. Then he turned to gun laws, and a call for Congress to pick up the baton: Biden went on the address the peril he said the US is in, if urgent action is not taken: Joe Biden attacked the 'hateful and perverse ideology' behind the Buffalo massacre as he and first lady Jill Biden visited the city and paid tribute to the victims. In an emotional but powerful address to mourners, officials and first responders, the president called on Americans to 'enlist' in the fight against racial hatred: Biden condemned years of racially-based attacks across the country. Joe Biden has just begun his remarks at the scene of the mass shooting in Buffalo that claimed 10 lives on Saturday. 'We've come to grieve with you,' the president said, after being introduced by first lady Jill Biden. 'The feeling like there's a black hole in your chest, you're suffocating, you're unable to breath. The anger, and the pain, the depth of a loss that's so profound'. Biden is naming the victims one by one, and telling his audience a little about them. He is expected to move on shortly to a call for Congress to tighten gun laws.", "3f7e2035aa8f6d5bc06e1f7b9ffb3c687d57f80cc18f81b8f9c23357": "", "d700095576e744d3255d03c540926052892967d482da21b0b18da364": "Growing numbers of refugees are being made homeless, and in many cases destitute, after relationship breakdowns with their Homes for Ukraine hosts in the UK, community organisations have said. Some predict the system could crash entirely after reports of Ukrainian refugees being asked to leave the homes of their sponsors with only one day's notice, leaving them with no option but to be referred to local authorities as homeless or, if they can afford to, attempt to seek last-minute rented accommodation. Community leaders said such incidents were happening among typically well-meaning hosts who may have failed to anticipate the enormity of the commitment until refugees arrived in their homes, adding to the stress and trauma of the newcomers. Other factors cited include costs, personality and cultural clashes, hosts not setting house rules, misunderstandings and communication problems. Iryna Terlecky, a board member of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, said: 'Our community is seeing these cases frequently and our perception is that they're increasing.' They also report similar issues among those who arrived on the Ukraine family scheme - either caused by space problems or relationship breakdowns. 'We are finding that sponsorship relationships are breaking down - in spite of the very clear desire of people to help,' Terlecky said. A 43-year-old Ukrainian woman told the Guardian she was left homeless, terrified and not knowing where to turn after being asked to leave by her Homes for Ukraine hosts after little more than a week. After Russia's invasion she fled her 22nd-floor flat in Kyiv for Spain but she found it difficult to find work. She met her UK hosts, a couple from Exeter, on Facebook who arranged her flights and documentation. At first, she said, they all got on well and she felt 'loved and cared for'. But their dynamic shifted dramatically when she went to visit a man she had met online. Her hosts have accused her of lying. 'It's a terrible feeling,' she said, speaking from emergency council accommodation in a hotel. 'You feel really happy, loved and cared for and then you feel like you've been thrown from a high-rise building to the ground.' Meanwhile, the Local Government Association said there had been a 'concerning increase' in Ukrainian arrivals presenting as homeless, and it urgently called for a rematching process so refugees were not left in limbo. Government sources told the Observer they were working on a 'rematching' service. Marta Mulyak, who has hosted several Ukrainian families since the start of the war and is chair of 1st London Plast, a Ukrainian Scout group, said: 'A lot of people say, 'Of course I can give a room to a Ukrainian'. But then bills, cost of food - people maybe don't think about that until they have come.'  Many newly arrived refugees are still experiencing the trauma of having lived in a war zone. Mulyak has seen children fall to the floor after mistaking a loud noise for a bomb. 'The Homes for Ukraine scheme has a lot of problems and eventually will lead to a total crash,' she said. Anya Abdulakh, from Families4Peace, a charity helping Ukrainians in north London, said she was recently contacted by a woman who came to the UK with her daughter to live with a woman she met on Facebook.  But when they arrived, the host was going through a divorce and it transpired that she was a strict vegetarian who did not want meat in the house - leading to tension. 'The situation now is that she [the host] wants her to move as quickly as possible,' she said. Sara Nathan, the co-founder of Refugees at Home, expects the problems with the scheme to 'stay quite acute for some time' - especially once placements hit six months, the minimum time hosts must commit to. A Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: 'We do not recognise these claims - more than 46,100 people have arrived through both Ukraine schemes and the vast majority of these are settling in well. 'There are stringent safeguarding measures in place for the Homes for Ukraine scheme and, according to council data reports, very few of these sponsorships are breaking down. Where they do, councils are able to provide support or find a more suitable sponsor.'", "20b4790f579eb9203470b8782acd531099df30124cc6b1ce977a3172": "More than 260 Ukrainian soldiers, many of them wounded, have been evacuated from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol, appearing to cede control of the city to Russia after 82 days of bombardment. Ukraine's deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said late on Monday that 53 heavily wounded soldiers were evacuated to a hospital in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk. More than 200 others were transported through a corridor to Olenivka, Maliar said. The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said that the soldiers defending the steel plant had 'performed their combat task' and now the main goal was to save the lives of personnel. By holding the steelworks, they stopped Russian forces from rapidly capturing the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, its statement on Facebook said. It was unclear how many soldiers remained in the steel plant, but Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: 'We hope to save the lives of our boys'. 'I want to underline: Ukraine needs its Ukrainian heroes alive. This is our principle,' he said in a video statement. The evacuation is likely to mark the end of the longest and bloodiest battle of the Ukraine war and a significant defeat for Ukraine. Mariupol is now in ruins after a Russian siege that Ukraine says killed tens of thousands of people in the city. For Ukrainians, the Azovstal plant has become a symbol of resistance, with hundreds of troops continuing to fight on there even after the rest of the city had fallen to Russian forces. Some 600 troops were believed to have been inside the steel plant. The Azov regiment said it was fulfilling orders to save the lives of its troops. The regiment, which has in the past had nationalist far-right affiliations, was a militia formed to fight the Russians after the invasion of Ukraine in 2014 but has become a unit of the Ukrainian national guard. It said its troops in Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov in the south-east, had held out for 82 days, buying time for the rest of Ukraine to battle Russian forces and secure western arms needed to withstand Moscow's assault.  Hours before the evacuation, Russia said it had reached an agreement to remove the wounded soldiers. 'A humanitarian corridor has been opened through which wounded Ukrainian servicemen are being taken to a medical facility in Novoazovsk,' Russia's defence ministry said. Azovstal's last defenders had been holding out in bunkers and tunnels built deep underground to withstand nuclear war. Civilians were evacuated from inside the plant, one of the largest metallurgical facilities in Europe, earlier this month. The wife of an Azov regiment member described conditions at the plant earlier on Monday: 'They are in hell. They receive new wounds every day. They are without legs or arms, exhausted, without medicines,' Natalia Zaritskaya said. As the Azov evacuations were under way, fighting continued on frontlines across Ukraine. In eastern Ukraine, the focus of Russia's military campaign, nine civilians were killed in attacks on Donetsk, the region's governor said. A series of explosion also struck the western Ukraine city of Lviv, with reports of about 10 blasts in quick succession. Ukraine said troops defending its second-largest city, Kharkiv, had repelled Russian forces and advanced as far as the border with Russia. The reports could not be immediately verified. With Moscow showing no sign of relenting nearly three months into its invasion, Finland and Sweden were poised to give up decades of military non-alignment by joining the Nato military alliance. The move faces resistance from Turkey, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirming his country's intention to block the applications, accusing Finland and Sweden of harbouring terror groups, including outlawed Kurdish militants. Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Tuesday it respected Sweden's 'serious decision' to apply for Nato membership as Russia's invasion of Ukraine was an issue affecting not only Europe but also the Indo-Pacific region. Russian president Vladimir Putin said that while Finnish and Swedish membership of Nato posed 'no direct threat for us', he warned 'the expansion of military infrastructure to these territories will certainly provoke our response'. In other developments: Reuters and Agence-France Presse contributed to this report", "70584d8e3e70136a89f9a44248842689a98bfe48f985ae595e07c88a": "", "e44d8d9c4e83bc82bcb8052f0b40699b3c0adcd79c0db9358df41068": "Russia has told Finland and Sweden that their decision to join the Nato military alliance is a serious mistake with far-reaching consequences and that they should not assume that Moscow will not respond. The Finnish government on Sunday confirmed its intention to join Nato while Sweden's ruling party agreed to drop its longstanding opposition to the idea, paving the way for a joint membership application within days. The decision by the two governments, both of which have remained neutral or non-aligned since the end of the second world war, herald a historic redrawing of Europe's security map prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. 'The situation is, of course, changing radically in light of what is happening,' Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Monday. 'The fact that Finland and Sweden's security will not be strengthened as a result of this is very clear to us.' Ryabkov added that the two Nordic nations 'should have no illusions that we will simply put up with it', warning that the move was 'another grave mistake with far-reaching consequences' and the 'general level of military tension will increase'. Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) land border with Russia and Sweden a maritime border. Both countries have for decades considered that joining the 30-member, US-led Nato alliance would represent an unnecessary provocation of Moscow. However, Putin's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has led to a profound change in Nordic thinking, with public support for Nato accession in Finland more than trebling to about 75% and rising to between 50% and 60% in Sweden. The Swedish and Finnish parliaments on Monday began debating the issue, with the session in Helsinki likely to last several days. While 85% of Finland's 200 MPs back membership, 150 have requested to speak and a vote was not expected on Monday. 'Our security environment has fundamentally changed,' the prime minister, Sanna Marin, told parliament as she opened the debate on Monday. 'The only country that threatens European security, and is now openly waging a war of aggression, is Russia.' In Stockholm, where the parliamentary vote is also expected to be a formality, the prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, said on Sunday after her Social Democratic party came out in favour of joining Nato that she would consult MPs before announcing her government's official intention to apply later in the day. The Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, is due in Stockholm on an official visit on Tuesday and Wednesday, suggesting a joint application by the two Nordic neighbours to join the alliance could be formally submitted within the next three days. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said both countries would be 'welcomed with open arms' and their accession would be quick, although Turkish objections could delay the process, which requires unanimity among members. Sweden's defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, said on Monday Stockholm was working to overcome Ankara's reservations, which centre on Swedish support for the Kurdish PKK group, designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the EU and the US. 'We will send a group of diplomats to hold discussions and have a dialogue with Turkey so we can see how this can be resolved and what this is really about,' Hultqvist said. Speaking before a meeting with EU foreign ministers in Brussels, the Canadian foreign minister, Melanie Joly, called for Finland and Sweden's speedy accession. 'Our goal is to be amongst the first countries to be able to ratify the accession of Sweden and Finland, because we know that the interim period between the accession demand and the ratification must be shortened,' she said. Joly added that she had held discussions with Turkey, saying: 'We need to meet this moment, this is historic and it is way more important than any bilateral issues.' Nato and the US have both said they were confident Turkey would not hold up the Nordic nation's accession. 'I'm confident we will be able to address the concerns Turkey has expressed in a way that doesn't delay the membership,' Stoltenberg said on Sunday.", "c4e1655eaacc0e83f1a6c83b160da1c1f8d250aab5a563e394e3ed08": "Vladimir Putin has become so personally involved in the Ukraine war that he is making operational and tactical decisions 'at the level of a colonel or brigadier', according to western military sources. The Russian president is helping determine the movement of forces in the Donbas, they added, where last week the invaders suffered a bloody defeat as they tried on multiple occasions to cross a strategic river in the east of Ukraine. The sources added that Putin is still working closely with Gen Valery Gerasimov, the commander of the Russian armed forces, in contrast to claims made by Ukraine last week that the military chief had been sidelined. 'We think Putin and Gerasimov are involved in tactical decision making at a level we would normally expect to be taken by a colonel or a brigadier,' the military source said, referring to the ongoing battle in the east of Ukraine. Moscow's armies have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough in the Donbas, where they have been mounting an offensive for a month that has failed several times encircle the smaller Ukrainian forces. No further detail to back up the statement was provided, although it was implied the assessment about Putin's close personal involvement was based on intelligence that had been received. Colonels in the US army and brigadiers in the British army typically command a brigade, units made up of a handful of battalions - the latter of which is equivalent to the smallest operating unit in the Russian army. Russia's military operates in a more top down fashion compared to western counterparts, with instructions typically sent to generals in the field. But Moscow's faltering invasion has meant that it has been forced to send generals closer to the frontline, where up to 12 have been killed, according to the Ukrainian armed forces. Ben Barry, a former brigadier in the British army, and a land warfare expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, said: 'A head of government should have better things to do than make military decisions. They should be setting the political strategy rather than getting bogged down in day to day activity'. Last week's failed attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets river at Bilohorivka led to the destruction of more than 70 Russian vehicles, and the loss of at least one batallion's worth of equipment, according to estimates based on aerial photography of the battle site. The defeat was so serious it led some Russian military bloggers to comment 'on the incompetence of the Russian military to their hundreds of thousands of followers', according to the Institute for the Study of War, a rare sign of internal dissent. In the past 24 hours, Russian forces shelled frontline positions in Ukraine's eastern Donbas area as fighting becomes increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region, said on Monday that Russian strikes had hit a hospital in the city over the weekend, killing two and injuring nine, including a child - and several other locations had been targeted. Ukrainian forces repelled 17 attacks on Sunday, he added, and destroyed 11 Russian armoured vehicles. The Russians are gradually mounting an assault on Severodonetsk, an industrial city that had a population of 100,000 before the war, as the effort to complete a wider encirclement of Ukraine's defending forces in the Donbas appears to have failed. Ukrainian forces also continued to push Russian forces back from Kharkiv, the country's second biggest city, with Volodomyr Zelenskiy congratulating soldiers who erected a new border post on Russia's border north of the city. 'I'm very grateful to you, on behalf of all Ukrainians, on my behalf and on behalf of my family,' he said in a video message. 'I'm very grateful to all the fighters like you.' Russia's withdrawal is a fighting retreat, however, with the outlying northern villages around Kharkiv being peppered with shelling on Monday, with one person confirmed killed in Tsyrkuny, 17 miles from the city centre and four injured in the districts of Shevchenkivskyi and Saltivka. Ukrainian officials said that Russian forces were concentrating on 'maintaining positions and preventing the advance of our troops toward the border'. Britain's chief of defence staff, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, said he believed that Ukraine was now winning the war because Putin had wanted to 'subjugate the whole of Ukraine' and 'impose his own rule on that country' and had failed. Giving a speech in to a parliamentary audience in Westminster, the head of the UK armed forces said Ukraine was winning because it had fought off 'an existential threat' and that 'its nation is going to survive,' he added. The Institute for the Study of War said it believed 'Russian forces have likely abandoned the objective of completing a large-scale encirclement of Ukrainian units from Donetsk City to Izium' in favour of capturing the remainder of the Luhansk region, of which Severodonetsk is part. A second smaller-scale encirclement of Severodonetsk also failed last week after Russian forces were defeated with heavy losses in a series of unsuccessful attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets River at Bilohorivka. The river is increasingly becoming a dividing line between the two sides in the Donbas - the name given collectively to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - and around Kharkiv to the north. Haidai said battles were taking place on Sunday to the north and south of Severodonetsk, which is one of the few locations held by Ukraine on the east side of the river. Analysts believe there may be a long struggle for the city. Konrad Muzyka, the founder of Rochan Consulting, which specialises in open source intelligence, said he believed the capture of Severodonetsk was weeks away. 'Moscow ... does not have the appropriate manpower and equipment levels to take the city swiftly,' he said in a weekly review of the fighting.", "db791bc6d1a11e62bb3143832eb14ceb596b2fb13e04c5b50431a5c9": "", "b46dcac732f05e23e448e22c8bb7e1122f5cdbf8c757235c6c22ae4e": "The white gunman accused of the massacre of 10 Black people at a Buffalo supermarket wrote as far back as November about staging a livestreamed attack on African Americans. He also practised shooting from his car and travelled hours from his home to scout out the store in March, according to detailed diary entries he appears to have posted online. The author of the diary posted hand-drawn maps of the grocery store along with tallies of the number of Black people he counted there, and recounted how a Black security guard at the supermarket confronted him that day to ask what he was up to. A Black security guard was among the dead in Saturday's rampage. The diary, taken from the chat platform Discord, came to light two days after 18-year-old Payton Gendron allegedly opened fire with an AR-15-style rifle at the Tops Friendly Market. He was wearing body armour and used a helmet camera to livestream the shootings on the internet, authorities said. He surrendered inside the supermarket and was arraigned on a murder charge over the weekend. He pleaded not guilty and was jailed under a suicide watch. Federal authorities are contemplating bringing hate crime charges. Copies of the online material were shared with the Associated Press by Marc-Andre Argentino, a research fellow at the London-based International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence. A transcript was apparently posted publicly sometime before the attack. It was not clear how many people might have seen the diary entries. Experts said it was possible but unlikely the diary could have been altered by someone other than the author. The FBI's top agent in Buffalo, Stephen Belongia, indicated on a call with other officials on Monday that investigators are looking at Gendron's Discord activity, citing posts last summer about body armour and guns and others last month in which he taunted federal authorities.  Belongia gave no details in the call but in a 17 April post apparently by Gendron he exhorted readers to kill agents from the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Messages seeking comment were left with Gendron's lawyers. No one answered the door at his family's home. The online diary details an 8 March reconnaissance visit the writer made to Buffalo, about 200 miles (320km) from Gendron's home in Conklin, New York. Joseph Gramaglia, the Buffalo police commissioner, said at a news conference there was information indicating Gendron was in Buffalo in March, but he declined to say more. The commissioner said numerous investigators were working to obtain and review Gendron's online postings. 'There's a lot of social that's being looked at, or that's being verified, captured,' Gramaglia said. 'Some of that takes warrants that have to be served on various social media platforms.' The author of the diary talked about checking out targets including the Tops Friendly Market and said a security guard asked what he was doing after his second visit of the day. He gave an excuse about collecting data and soon left - 'a close call', he wrote. A 180-page document purportedly written by Gendron said the attack was intended to terrorise all minority ethnic, non-Christian people and get them to leave the country. Federal authorities said they were working to confirm the document's authenticity. Gendron had briefly been on authorities' radar last spring when state police were called to his high school over a report that the then 17-year-old had made threatening statements. Belongia said Gendron had responded to a question about future plans by saying he wanted to commit a murder-suicide. A December Discord post that Gendron apparently made said he had given that answer to a question about retirement in an economics class and ended up spending 'one of the worst nights of my life' in a hospital. Gramaglia said Gendron had no further contact with law enforcement after a mental health evaluation. On the call with Belongia, Gramaglia said state police 'did everything within the confines of the law' at that time. It was unclear whether officials could have invoked New York's 'red flag' regulation, which lets law enforcement, school officials and families ask a court to order the seizure of guns from people considered dangerous. Federal law bars people from owning guns if a judge has determined they have a 'mental defect' or they have been forced into a mental institution. An evaluation alone would not trigger the prohibition. At the White House, Joe Biden paid tribute to the dead security guard, retired police officer Aaron Salter. Salter fired repeatedly at the attacker, striking his armour-plated vest at least once before being shot and killed. The president, due to visit Buffalo on Tuesday, said Salter 'gave his life trying to save others'. Authorities said that in addition to the 10 Black people killed, three people were wounded: one Black person and two white people.", "afb5af672e9f8b104e3aa2459bfb7c8287e2c8feed24c3d7b0910d15": "Japan will start conducting 'test tourism' in the form of limited package tours in May ahead of a full reopening to tourism. Though tourism was a major pillar of Japan's economy, tourists have not been permitted to enter since it adopted strict border controls in 2020 at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Regulations have been loosened slightly to allow students and some business travellers to enter. But, individual tourists remain barred despite calls from industry leaders hoping to restart tourism to take advantage of the yen, which has fallen to 20-year lows. Japan's Tourism Agency said it would start allowing small group tours to enter from later this month as 'test cases' to gain information for a broader resumption of tourism at an unspecified future date. Tourists who have been triple-vaccinated and come from the United States, Australia, Thailand and Singapore will be allowed to take part in the tours, which will be strictly planned in conjunction with travel agencies and accompanied at all times by tour conductors, it added. 'This venture will allow us to verify compliance and emergency responses for infection prevention and formulate guidelines for travel agencies and accommodation operators to keep in mind,' it said. Japan's prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said earlier this month in London that he would bring Japan's border controls into line with other wealthy democracies in June, but no further details have been given, including when the country will fully open its borders to tourists again. In 2019, Japan hosted 31.9 million foreign visitors, who spent 4.81tn yen ($37.2bn).", "5f822637fee2e96afa8c53c7c27d4e9f0badb33461bb8d5091a9189a": "As the US was rocked by deadly gun violence over the weekend, a shooting at an Orange county church on Sunday left southern California reeling when a gunman motivated by hate for Taiwanese people fired on congregants who managed to put a stop to the bloodshed. Authorities on Monday identified the suspect, who is accused of killing one person and wounding five others at the Geneva Presbyterian church, as David Chou of Las Vegas. The Orange county sheriff's department booked the 68-year-old on a felony count of murder and five felony counts of attempted murder. The violence in Irvine, about 50 miles south-east of Los Angeles, unfolded amid a weekend of horrific gun violence across America, including in Buffalo where an 18-year-old white supremacist killed 10 people at a grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood. In Los Angeles, a man died in a shooting at Grand Central Market on Saturday. Some of the patrons had been discussing the shooting in New York when the shots started and forced them to flee for cover. More people could have died in the Laguna Woods church shooting on Saturday were it not for churchgoers, authorities said. The shooter opened fire during a lunch banquet at the Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian church, which worships at Geneva Presbyterian, but was stopped when a pastor hit him on the head with a chair and parishioners used electrical cords to restrain him until police arrived. John Cheng, 52, was killed in the shooting, authorities said at a Monday news conference. Don Barnes, the Orange county sheriff, said the motive of the shooting was a grievance between the shooter, identified as a Chinese immigrant, and the Taiwanese community. China claims Taiwan is a part of its national territory and has not ruled out force to bring the island under its rule. Barnes said Chou drove to the Orange County church, where he was not a regular attendee, secured the doors and started shooting. He had also placed four molotov cocktail-like devices inside the church, the sheriff said. Chou lawfully purchased the two 9mm pistols used in the shooting in Las Vegas, said Stephen Galloway, ATF Los Angeles assistant special agent in charge. Barnes said Cheng, survived by a wife and two children, heroically charged at the shooter and attempted to disarm him, allowing others to intervene. A pastor hit the gunman on the head with a chair and parishioners hog-tied him with electrical cords. But Barnes said Cheng was hit by gunshots. 'Understanding that there was elderly everywhere and they couldn't get out of the premises because the doors had been chained ... he took it upon himself to charge across the room and to do everything he could to disable the assailant,' said Todd Spitzer, Orange county district attorney. Jerry Chen, 72, a longtime member of the church, said he had just stepped into a church kitchen when he heard gunshots and people began screaming. Peeking around the corner, he saw people running and hiding under tables. 'I knew someone was shooting,' he said. 'I was very, very scared. I ran out the kitchen door to call 911.' Chen said he was so shocked that he couldn't tell the operator the church's location and had to ask someone else for the address. About 40 people had gathered in the fellowship hall for a luncheon after a morning service to welcome their former Pastor Billy Chang, Chen said, who worked at the church for 20 years. Chang, a beloved and respected community member, moved back to Taiwan two years ago, Chen said, adding that this was his first time back in the US. 'Everyone had just finished lunch,' he said. 'They were taking photos with Pastor Chang. I had just finished my lunch and went into the kitchen.' Then he heard the gunshots and ran out to the parking lot. Fellow congregants told Chen that when the gunman stopped to reload, Pastor Chang hit him on the head with a chair. Others quickly went to grab the shooter's gun, and subdued him and tied him up, Chen said. 'It was amazing how brave (Chang) and the others were,' he said. 'This is just so sad. I never, ever thought something like this would happen in my church, in my community.' Most of the church's members are older, highly educated Taiwanese immigrants, Chen said. 'We're mostly retirees and the average age of our church is 80,' he said. All of those wounded in the shooting were senior citizens and four of them suffered critical gunshot injuries. Those wounded by gunshots included four Asian men, ages 66, 75, 82 and 92, and an 86-year-old Asian woman, the sheriff's department said. The majority of those inside the church at the time were believed to be of Taiwanese descent, said Carrie Braun, a sheriff's spokesperson. Laguna Woods, where the shooting occurred, was built as a senior living community and later became a city. More than 80% of residents in the city of 18,000 people are at least 65. The shooting took place in an area with a cluster of houses of worship, including Catholic, Lutheran and Methodist churches and a Jewish synagogue. The sheriff's office has said the investigation was in its early stages, and that investigators are looking into he was known to church members and how many shots were fired. The afternoon lunch reception was to honor a former pastor of the Taiwanese congregation, according to a statement from the Presbytery of Los Ranchos, a church administrative body. 'Please keep the leadership of the Taiwanese congregation and Geneva in your prayers as they care for the those traumatized by this shooting,' the presbytery's Tom Cramer said in a statement on Facebook. On its website, Geneva Presbyterian Church says its mission is 'to remember, tell, and live the way of Jesus by being just, kind, and humble'. 'All are welcome here. Really, we mean that! Geneva aspires to be an inclusive congregation worshipping, learning, connecting, giving and serving together.' The governor's office said on Twitter that he was closely monitoring the situation. 'No one should have to fear going to their place of worship. Our thoughts are with the victims, community, and all those impacted by this tragic event,' the tweet said. The US has seen multiple shootings inside houses of worship in recent years. The deadliest incident was in 2017 in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where a gunman opened fire during a Sunday service at First Baptist Church and killed more than two dozen people. In 2015, white supremacist Dylann Roof fired dozens of bullets during the closing prayer of a Bible study session at Charleston's Mother Emanuel AME Church in South Carolina. Roof killed nine members of the Black congregation and was the first person in the US sentenced to death for a federal hate crime. His appeal remains before the supreme court.

Investigators discovered the tunnel, which led to a warehouse in an industrial area on US soil, last week. The tunnel is located about half a mile (0.8km) from the Otay Mesa border crossing between Tijuana and San Diego, in an area where more than a dozen others have been discovered in the past two decades. After staking out a home that had recently been used as drug stash house, agents began making traffic stops of vehicles near the warehouse, turning up boxes full of cocaine, according to a federal criminal complaint filed in US district court in San Diego. They raided the properties - finding no other drugs at the warehouse, but a tunnel opening carved into the cement floor, federal prosecutors said. The tunnel ran one-third of a mile to Tijuana. It was 4ft (1.2 meters) in diameter and about six stories deep. Agents seized 1,762lb (799kg) of cocaine, 165lb (75kg) of meth and 3.5lb (1.6kg) of heroin from the vehicles and the residence, and they arrested six people on federal drug conspiracy charges. The cross-border tunnel was built in one of the most fortified stretches of the border, illustrating the limitations of Donald Trump's border wall. While considered effective against small, crudely built tunnels called 'gopher holes', walls are no match for more sophisticated passages that run deeper underground. Authorities have found about 15 sophisticated tunnels on California's border with Mexico since 2006. Many tunnels, including the one announced Monday, are in San Diego's Otay Mesa industrial area, where clay-like soil is conducive to digging and warehouses provide cover. The cross-border passages date back to the early 1990s and have been used primarily to smuggle multi-ton loads of marijuana. The US Drug Enforcement Administration said in 2020 that they were generally found in California and Arizona and associated with Mexico's Sinaloa cartel. By federal law, US authorities must fill the US side of tunnels with concrete after they are discovered.", "9604a1aecf384530b09e6330ea5cb375d107eebd880bdf159952e32f": "The UK will not 'shy away' from legislating to change the Northern Ireland protocol without agreement from the EU, the Northern Ireland secretary has said, as Liz Truss prepares to tell the Commons about plans to unilaterally lift checks. The foreign secretary will tell MPs of plans to bring forward the draft legislation after a cabinet discussion on Northern Ireland. However, the timetable for the draft laws has slipped, with the text now only promised before the summer break, according to Whitehall sources. Brandon Lewis denied plans had been delayed after an alarmed response from Dublin and Washington, saying there had been no intention to put the full legislation before parliament this week. 'Something like that this week was never on the cards. We're still debating the Queen's speech and won't finish debating the Queen's speech and voting on that until later this week, later tomorrow, so in that sense it was never on the cards,' Lewis told Sky News. 'But what we have always said is that we will not take anything off the table. We will do what we need to do to ensure that products can move to Northern Ireland in the way that they should be able to move to Northern Ireland from Great Britain as part of the United Kingdom internal market, something the protocol itself says it will respect but at the moment is not working properly. The plans to take unilateral action were causing a 'wobble' in Westminster on Monday night after the DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, went further than before in a press interview and warned he would not go back into the Stormont executive until new laws were 'enacted' . Truss is expected to tell MPs of plans to legislate before the summer should renewed negotiations fail. Lewis said legislation remained the fallback option and the government hoped to return to talks. 'We would like to do that by agreement with the EU but we reserve the right to do what we need to do to do the right thing for the people of Northern Ireland and the wider United Kingdom,' he said. Lewis said there were companies unable to operate under the current rules. 'There are too many companies, including major supermarkets, at the moment who have no stores in the Republic of Ireland, who are moving their products from their depots in Great Britain into Northern Ireland for sale and consumption in Northern Ireland, but going through checks as if they were going into the EU,' he said. 'That just doesn't work and there are products that can't travel that way.' He said there was an urgency to find a new solution because the EU proposals would increase the bureaucratic burden. The UK has already acted unilaterally to increase grace periods. 'What sometimes gets missed in this is that what the EU is proposing now is that some of the checks we've had grace periods for - we are at a standstill at the moment where we are not fully applying some of the checks the EU wants - they actually want to bring those in, so they want to make matters materially worse for the people of Northern Ireland, and that's just not viable,' Lewis said. Johnson said on a visit to Belfast that the UK did not want to scrap the Northern Ireland protocol, but believed it could be 'fixed'. He told broadcasters: 'We don't want to scrap it. But we think it can be fixed. And actually five of the five parties I talked to today also think it needs reform.'", "97917394e80ebe89cbe4da84ce6a2edb0cea76dc3a26924f06c60b72": "Nearly one in 25 people in a county of the Uyghur heartland of China has been sentenced to prison on terrorism-related charges, in what is the highest known imprisonment rate in the world, an Associated Press review of leaked data shows. A list obtained and partially verified by the Associated Press cites the names of more than 10,000 Uyghurs sent to prison in just Konasheher county, one of dozens in southern Xinjiang. In recent years, China has waged a brutal crackdown on the Uyghurs, a largely Muslim minority, which it has described as a 'war on terror'. The list is by far the biggest to emerge to date with the names of imprisoned Uyghurs, reflecting the sheer size of a Chinese government campaign that swept an estimated million or more people into internment camps and prisons. It also confirms what families and rights groups have said for years: China is relying on a system of long-term incarceration to keep the Uyghurs in check, wielding the law as a weapon of repression. Under searing international criticism, Chinese officials announced the closure in 2019 of short-term, extrajudicial internment camps where Uyghurs were thrown in without charges. However, although attention focused on the camps, thousands of Uyghurs still languish for years or even decades in prison on what experts say are trumped-up charges of terrorism. Konasheher county is typical of rural southern Xinjiang, and more than 267,000 people live there. The prison sentences across the county were for two to 25 years, with an average of nine years, the list shows. While the people on the list were mostly arrested in 2017, according to Uyghurs in exile, their sentences are so long that the vast majority would still be in prison. Those swept up came from all walks of life, and included men, women, young people and elderly people. They had only one thing in common: they were all Uyghurs. Experts say it clearly shows people were targeted simply for being Uyghur - a conclusion vehemently denied by Chinese authorities. Xinjiang spokesman Elijan Anayat said sentences were carried out in accordance with the law. 'We will never specifically target specific regions, ethnic groups, religions, much less the Uyghurs,' Anayat said. 'We will never wrong the good, nor release the bad.' The list was obtained by Xinjiang scholar Gene Bunin from an anonymous source who described themselves as a member of China's Han Chinese majority 'opposed to the Chinese government's policies in Xinjiang'. It was passed to the AP by Abduweli Ayup, an exiled Uyghur linguist in Norway. The AP authenticated it through interviews with eight Uyghurs who recognised 194 people on the list, as well as legal notices, recordings of phone calls with Chinese officials and checks of address, birthdays and identity numbers. The list does not include people with typical criminal charges such as homicide or theft. Rather, it focuses on offences related to terrorism, religious extremism or vague charges traditionally used against political dissidents, such as 'picking quarrels and provoking troubles'. This means the true number of people imprisoned is almost certainly higher. But even at a conservative estimate, Konasheher county's imprisonment rate is more than 10 times higher than that of the United States, one of the world's leading jailers, according to Department of Justice statistics. It's also more than 30 times higher than for China as a whole, according to state statistics from 2013, the last time such figures were released. Darren Byler, an expert on Xinjiang's mass incarceration system, said most arrests were arbitrary and outside the law, with people detained for having relatives abroad or downloading certain mobile phone applications. 'It is really remarkable,' Byler said. 'In no other location have we seen entire populations of people be described as terrorists or seen as terrorists.' China is using the law 'as a fig leaf of legality' in part to try to deflect international criticism about holding Uyghurs, said Jeremy Daum, a criminal law expert at Yale University's Paul Tsai China Center. The secretive nature of the charges against those imprisoned is a red flag, experts say. Although China makes legal records easily accessible otherwise, almost 90% of criminal records in Xinjiang are not public. The handful which have leaked show that people are being charged with 'terrorism' for acts such as warning colleagues against watching porn and swearing, or praying in prison.", "07f5ac890485de8611b95bb60e7aa2d0da0a79ae0e74b1111206b085": "Elon Musk has said his $44bn (PS35bn) takeover of Twitter cannot progress until the social media company proves that less than 5% of its users are spam accounts. The Tesla chief executive used his Twitter account to say that the deal will not move forward until the firm shows proof that only a small proportion of its users are fake. Musk had announced last week that the deal was on hold after he queried Twitter's claim in filings with the US financial regulator that a small proportion of its users are fake. 'My offer was based on Twitter's SEC filings being accurate. Yesterday, Twitter's CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%. This deal cannot move forward until he does.' On Monday, Musk suggested that he could seek to pay a lower price for Twitter, as the social media company's would-be owner continued to express concerns about the presence of fake accounts on the platform. He said reducing his agreed $54.20 a share offer wouldn't be 'out of the question', days after putting the $44bn deal 'on hold' after he queried the number of spam accounts on Twitter.

Pascal Lamy, a former director general of the WTO and a former EU trade commissioner, now president of the Paris Peace Forum, said governments were increasingly likely to explore the possibilities of geoengineering, as efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions have so far been inadequate. 'Given where we are, we have to seriously consider the risk of overshooting 1.5C,' said Lamy. 'That is a huge risk. All of the ways by which we can alleviate this risk must be evaluated. I think a global effort on geoengineering could work.' At present, there is little to stop a government experimenting with geoengineering. 'There should be ways of stopping countries from doing this alone,' Lamy told the Guardian. 'We should look at all options, including a moratorium.' But Lamy said the likelihood of an individual billionaire, such as Elon Musk, attempting to geoengineer the climate without government involvement was still remote. 'I don't think that is a danger. I think Elon Musk would need some kind of authority [from governments],' he said. 'I don't think he could try to do it alone. You need government clearance to send up a rocket, even.' Geoengineering would involve trying to change the earth's temperature or climate through methods such as whitening clouds, or injecting sulphur particles into the atmosphere to reflect more sunlight, or spreading iron in the ocean to absorb carbon dioxide. Ideas such as launching a giant sunshade into space have also been suggested, along with more prosaic options including painting roofs white. None of these possibilities have yet been tried, and some could be dangerous: for instance, spraying sulphur could cause acidification of the seas, cloud whitening could change rainfall patterns and deflecting the sun's rays could cause crops to fail. But Lamy said the world had to examine such methods, as countries were failing to cut greenhouse gases fast enough. 'It is tragic that we have to consider this [geoengineering]. Because we know we are not on the right path to avoid overshooting 1.5C,' he said. Scientists warned this month there was a 50:50 chance of global average temperatures rising to more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels within the next five years. If the earth's temperatures exceed 1.5C consistently, drastic and in some cases irreversible changes to the climate will follow, including melting of the ice caps, floods, droughts, heatwaves and sea level rises. Some methods of geoengineering could be cheap, Lamy added. 'Some could be economically rather cheap, whereas we know that carbon capture and storage is something very costly.' Lamy said the science behind geoengineering required careful investigation, but his concern is directed towards how any such attempts would be governed at an international level. Some forms of weather manipulation have already been tried: for instance, cloud-seeding to provoke rainfall has been used in China. Lamy, as president of the Paris Peace Forum thinktank, is leading a new initiative to establish potential governance structures for geoengineering. He has convened a panel of 16 global experts, called the Global Overshoot Commission. They will consider recommendations on how geoengineering can be governed, both within existing international structures such as the UN, and the potential need for new governance bodies. The commission will produce a report, probably consisting of a series of principles to be observed, that will be presented to governments in 2023, before the Cop28 UN climate summit. It will have no legal standing, but is intended to inform government thinking. As well as geoengineering, the commission will consider ways of helping countries to adapt to the ravages of the climate crisis, the potential for new technologies such as carbon capture and storage, and ways of 'repairing' the climate to reduce temperatures after they have breached the 1.5C limit.", "42d2edfbe4c50010913d6e5340b9fb3b505043b4f9b7a0933709fb99": "Millions of people with osteoporosis should not be afraid to exercise regularly, experts have said in guidance aimed at boosting bone health, cutting the risk of falls and improving posture. The condition, which weakens bones and makes them more likely to break, affects more than 3 million people in the UK and more than 150 million worldwide. The most common injuries are a broken wrist, hip and spinal bones. More than 500,000 people receive hospital treatment for fragility fractures every year on the NHS as a result of osteoporosis. Until now, there has not been any UK guidance on exercise and osteoporosis. There is some in the US, Australia, and Canada but even that is incomplete. Regular exercise strengthens bones, reduces the risk of fractures and falls, and improves posture, as well as bolstering overall mental and physical health, experts say, which is why it is important that people with osteoporosis do not miss out. But uncertainties about what type of physical activity is safe, particularly later in life or when bones have significantly weakened, have left doctors uncertain what to recommend and deterred some patients from regular activity. In an attempt to clear up the confusion, a multidisciplinary panel of experts reviewed existing evidence and drew on clinical and patient opinion to reach agreement on recommendations to maximise bone health while minimising fracture risk. The resulting consensus statement, endorsed by the Royal Osteoporosis Society, has been published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. People with the condition should be encouraged to do more rather than less, it says, by undertaking an exercise routine that focuses on muscle strengthening on two to three days a week and brief bursts of moderate-impact activities, such as jogging, aerobics or Zumba on most days. And for those who have previously sustained a vertebral fracture or who are frail/elderly, the advice is to include lower-impact exercise up to the level of brisk walking for 20 minutes a day. The chair of the panel, Dawn Skelton, a professor of ageing and health at Glasgow Caledonian University, said: 'Anyone who is new to regular physical activity, worried about their technique or unsure how to build their fitness can seek advice from any trained exercise instructor. Those with a history of falls or serious concerns about their balance can contact their local falls service.'", "acb69a155afb550d4ec33c3a92a53f16db0e3e3d640ebc790b280215": "Margaret Beckett's office - a calm and ordered room off an ancient courtyard - must be some of the most prime real estate in the Palace of Westminster. We meet there and the division bell rings constantly. Even when she doesn't have to dash off to vote, she stops talking immediately, because she knows I won't be able to hear her when I play back the recording. It gives her a hypervigilant air, like a spy at a cocktail party, pretending to small-talk. Periodically, she does have to leave to vote. There is typically a mic drop as she exits the room, for example: 'I think [Brexiters] thought the EU would entrench social democracy and they're agin it. Because they believe in them not paying any taxes at all and us not having any services.' Whenever she returns, she has a piece of fun gossip. While we are talking, Vladimir Putin announces sanctions against 200 named British MPs. I ask what that means in practical terms and she says: 'No idea, but everyone not on the list is terribly upset. Chris Bryant [the Labour MP for Rhondda] is fuming!' She has just announced her intention to retire from parliament at the next election, after a career so long that sometimes even she is surprised. It tells in her manner that this is her last parliament. She is as astonished at Conservative callousness as she has ever been - and she lived through 1983, Margaret Thatcher's bloodbath year, 'when they cut every single benefit; maternity grant to death grant and everything in between. Partway through, they guillotined the bill because they needed to put another whole section in to cut widows' benefits.' But in conversation, and hearing her later that week on the radio, she has total ease and authority. 'Can I come back to you on that?' she said to Chris Mason on Any Questions. 'I'm in the middle of a rant.' There is a woman, I thought, who has done her duty. Beckett was Britain's first female foreign secretary (Tony Blair appointed her in 2006) and is the longest-serving female MP, although Harriet Harman has the longest continuous service. Beckett lost her seat in the Tory landslide of 1979, but before that - it is astonishing to think of it now - had been a minister, having been appointed less than a year after being elected in Harold Wilson's snap vote at the end of 1974. It was a thrilling time to be in Westminster: 'Desperately exciting. We never had a majority.' Wilson had, in fact, 'scraped' a majority of three seats, after the February election had delivered a hung parliament (the first since 1929: think of the coalition government of 2010, then give the Lib Dems some spine, and you have an idea of the chaos). Post-October, any given vote could be scuppered by one (and a half) rebel Labour MPs. 'Every vote, you were watching to see who would win. There was a point when we won a vote by four. Ann Taylor [now Baroness Taylor] said to me: 'Walter [Harrison, the deputy chief whip] would have called that overkill.' We both fell about, because it was perfectly true. If you didn't need four votes, you only went for two, because you'd save the others for another time.' Whatever you think of Westminster now, nothing could match the late 70s for sheer delinquency. 'We used to be here till 11.30 every night. There was one occasion when in the house it was still Tuesday, because we'd been sitting since Tuesday. In the real world, it was Thursday. I remember once being on the terrace, in 1977, and seeing two Tory whips come out for an early breakfast, about four or five in the morning. And they each had a glass of red wine and a glass of tequila on their breakfast tray.' Wilson's government has, of course, gone into the collective imagination as a disaster, possibly even the origin of the increasingly ridiculous cliche that Labour can't manage the nation's finances. Ted Heath had presided over a relatively prosperous Britain until the oil price shock of late 1973, whereupon the economy started to cascade. 'Prices quadrupled; they even quintupled in places,' she says. This didn't instantly multiply all other prices, but it did cause unemployment and dizzying inflation rises, from single digits under Heath to 24% by 1975; Labour, having won, 'got the blame for all the fallout'. Has she no anxiety that we might be about to replay that very scenario? 'No,' she says. 'Don't get me wrong. I'll be very happy if Labour wins the next election.' Apart from four years as a journalist at Granada TV, Beckett has been representing a constituency since 1974, first Lincoln, then, after 1983, Derby South. Yet calling her a 'career politician', even though it is true, gives the impression of a silver-spooned insider, which is not the case. Her father, a carpenter, died when she was 12, leaving the family - her and two sisters, one who became a doctor, the other a nun - in poverty, despite her mother working as a teacher. Beckett, nee Jackson, and her (doctor) sister tried to get involved in the local Labour party, but it was tough even finding out where the meetings were. She will not refer or even allude to sexism in the party in the 70s, or indeed ever: it is not important why the local party never returned the sisters' calls; all that matters is that eventually they bust their way in and Beckett quickly established herself in the party's research unit. 'I said: 'Surely you only want Oxbridge economists? I'm a metallurgist from Manchester.' They said: 'Well, as a matter of fact, our head of department is a metallurgist from Birmingham.'' The final heave to becoming an MP came when she met Leo Beckett at the Labour party's conference. He was an engineer by trade, after having served in the RAF, but his passion was behind-the-scenes manoeuvring in the Labour party, which was putting together a shortlist for the Lincoln constituency and needed 'either a woman or a trade unionist'. He was nearly 20 years older than her, which might help you to understand why such a forceful person might accept such a life-changing suggestion so lightly. 'He said: 'Why don't you go for it? It would be good experience. But just so you know, you won't win this time. And just warning you, when it comes to the next time, I want to be the candidate.'' That was February 1974 - and she duly lost. What Leo didn't know was that the next election would be nine months later, after a mad period of inflation and other crises, and that she would win. They married in 1979. Leo never stood for parliament and instead ran her office for almost all of her career. Last year, 'out of the blue - and this sounds like a silly thing to say about somebody who was 95 - he got an infection, then he got pneumonia and he died'. She has an absolute fear of self-pity. Beckett was elected again in 1983. She says politics in opposition wasn't as bad back then: she still got things done. She refers to an amendment she got away - a safety measure for child agricultural workers. Thanks to Beckett, there are probably 50-year-olds walking around today with two arms because they didn't lose one in a thresher. While it is not a thing she would make a huge song and dance about, she has a precise and detailed mind - and she hasn't forgotten it, either. It was as John Smith's deputy, between 1992 and 1994, that she was most dominant in the party. 'He thought the leader's job was to have the vision. But there was a whole lot of stuff that the leader always did that he didn't think the leader needed to do. And I did all of that. When I ceased to be the deputy leader, my jobs were distributed among five people.' That sounds like quite a bit of, ahem, emotional labour, I float. She flashes me a look and doesn't need to say: 'Don't be ridiculous,' out loud. The death of John Smith, in May 1994, and its impact on Labour and the UK, has passed into lore. He was as popular as anyone could remember a Labour leader being, an almost unimaginable figure of unity in the post-Kinnock years. His health had been an issue since his first heart attack in 1988, but privately. No one expected this deft, persuasive, confident, whip-smart 55-year-old to have a medical emergency, let alone a fatal one. It has spawned so many counterfactuals and alternative timelines (what would 21st-century British politics have looked like without Blair as PM?) that the human tragedy of it is often lost. 'It had a huge effect on the whole of politics. The Scottish Tories adjourned their conference,' Beckett says. She led the party for a short time, guiding it to victory in the European elections in 1994 with the largest vote-share Labour had received for more than 20 years. 'I don't take credit for that. That was a sympathy vote.' She stood against Blair as leader, which annoyed him ('They wanted a coronation'), simultaneously standing against John Prescott for deputy, a job she didn't want ('Tony already had two best friends, Peter Mandelson and Gordon Brown. I would never have had any influence or relationship'). It is all a bit mysterious: why stand for either, let alone both? 'I allowed my name to go forward, because I thought the party has got to have what it wants.' She is a Labour loyalist from a different era, before that was code for 'expel your opponent', back when it meant, above all, duty and, second, flexibility. A lot of her decisions don't make sense unless you remember that. She takes a huge amount of pride in 1997. 'We were good. We were a strong team. Person for person, and as a team, we were better than they were. And we knew it.' She does have regrets about the Blair years, complex ones around the creation of a social atmosphere. 'We did a lot of good things for people who are poor. But we shied away from making the case. If you stand for the poor, people might think that's a good thing, but they don't think they're included, including the people who are poor. They don't think that means them. And they don't want it to be them.' They never took on the stigma of poverty, which allowed George Osborne to weaponise it later. 'He was evilly clever about making people dislike people on benefits.' And there were more material weaknesses - voices in cabinet wanted to build more council houses to replace Thatcher's sell-off, but there was 'a fear of sounding old-fashioned and not relevant to the times. So we'd only talk about social housing.' She stands by the war in Iraq. 'What everybody's forgotten is that, at the time, everybody in the world believed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.' That plainly wasn't so: there were people in the cabinet who didn't believe it, such as Robin Cook (then the leader of the house) and Claire Short (international development secretary). 'Robin and Claire had their own reasons for leaving,' she says. 'And Robin never said to cabinet: 'If we don't get a second resolution, I will feel I have to resign.' It might have had an effect on people. But he didn't say it till afterwards.' (Beckett is referring to the second UN security council resolution, which was withdrawn before going before a vote. The lack of a second resolution means most legal scholars, as well as keepers of the international order right up to Kofi Annan, see the war in Iraq as illegal, a breach of the UN Charter.) After the star of the war, which she accepts 'went sour', she became foreign secretary in 2006 and pulled off something spectacular - or at least it would have been, and we would be glad of it now, had it realised its ambition. She made the UK the first nuclear power to commit to multilateral disarmament. 'It was a sensation. I gather that's how Global Zero got off the ground.' (Global Zero was an attempt to get all nuclear powers to pledge 'no first use', which would have obviated nuclear arsenals before their 100th anniversary.) When she left the job, 'I absolutely expected that David [Miliband] would pick up the baton [of nuclear disarmament] and run with it, and I would never get an ounce of credit for having had anything to do with it. But David didn't do anything about it.' The younger reader may have experienced their first Beckett controversy when she called herself 'a moron' for nominating Jeremy Corbyn in the 2015 leadership election. It was a bit more complicated than that. A grandee had called the Corbyn-nominators 'morons'. 'I happened to be doing an interview the next morning, when this was quoted, so I said: 'Full disclosure - I was one of them.' The message was: 'You called yourself a moron.' But his argument was that the debate had to include austerity. I agreed with that very strongly. I also immediately said: 'Oh, but don't vote for him.'' Beckett voted for Andy Burnham that time around, and is very supportive of Keir Starmer, defending even his war against the left of the party, of which she would once have considered herself a member. 'I think the total figure is something like 80 people have been expelled. People talk as though there are hundreds or thousands.' Beckett made the decision to retire with Leo. 'I came to the conclusion that I could do another parliament, but he probably ought not to.' When he died, he was the only person she had discussed it with.

Spain led the way, with 108 structures taken out of the country's rivers. 'Our efforts to expand dam removals across Europe are gathering speed,' said Pao Fernandez Garrido, project manager for the World Fish Migration Foundation, who helped produce Dam Removal Europe's annual report. 'An increasing number of governments, NGOs, companies and communities are understanding the importance of halting and reversing nature loss, and buying into the fact that dam removal is a river-restoration tool that boosts biodiversity and enhances climate resilience. We're also seeing lessons being learned from previous dam removals, new countries kickstarting removals, and new funds, including crowdfunding.' More than 1m barriers are estimated to exist on Europe's rivers, with many built more than a century ago. At least 150,000 are old, obsolete barriers that serve no economic purpose. Dams, weirs and other river obstacles block fish migration routes, often leading to the loss of breeding areas and reduced numbers of species such as salmon, sturgeon, trout and eel, which affects the wider biodiversity of ecosystems, including species ranging from eagles to otters. Free-flowing rivers also transport sediments and nutrients. 'Removing dams is a real need,' said Fernandez Garrido. 'We have hundreds of thousands of abandoned barriers, which is a safety problem. Dams affect water quality and underground water levels, cause channel and coastal erosion and beach disappearances, generate greenhouse gas emissions and lead to declines and even extinctions of migratory fish populations, with a 93% decline of migratory fish in Europe in the last 50 years. Dams have a negative impact on the environment, so if a dam or weir isn't strictly necessary any more, we mustn't pass the burden to future generations.' Dam Removal Europe is a coalition of seven organisations, including the World Fish Migration Foundation, WWF, the Rivers Trust and Rewilding Europe, working to restore healthy, free-flowing rivers across the continent. The latest report found that 76% of the removals were of small dams and weirs, but 24% were higher than 2 metres. Three countries - Portugal, Montenegro, and Slovakia - recorded their first ever dam removals in 2021. In Finland, a functioning hydropower dam was also dismantled, the first of three on the Hiitolanjoki River, which, when completed, is expected to allow landlocked salmon to return to spawning grounds. 'This is the perfect example to show that when an operating hydropower dam isn't needed, and energy can be supplied by other sources, it's worth removing it and recovering the river,' said Fernandez Garrido. 'The river will be totally free of dams for the first time in over 120 years.' Spain removed 108 barriers from its rivers in 2021, including the 13m-high Anllarinos dam, the tallest European dam taken out last year. 'Spanish law is one of the best for dealing with dams,' said Rafael Seiz from WWF-Spain's Freshwater Programme. 'Spain has legislation that obligates the owner to pay for its infrastructure removal once they stop using it.'  'Spain, France, Denmark, Finland and the UK are blazing a trail,' said Fernandez Garrido. 'There are other countries that need to make strong efforts to start, such as Italy, Portugal and Greece, and almost all countries in eastern Europe, where many proponents of dam removals are still afraid to openly talk about it.' With dramatic declines in freshwater fish populations, restoring free-flowing rivers is seen as urgent. 'We truly think 2022 will beat 2021, [because] financial aids are being created to help cover the removal costs, like the new Open Rivers Programme, which will invest EUR42.5m over the next six years to help remove river barriers in Europe,' said Fernandez Garrido. 'We really want to see governments from all countries taking action and creating national grants and plans to completely free some of their rivers from obstacles, so there is, at least, a free and healthy river per country. We're talking about creating a big shift.'

Workers in hi-vis began dismantling stages and pulling down scaffolding, as the departing representatives of nearly 200 countries exchanged weak high-fives and wry grins. After two weeks of gruelling climate talks, there was a broadly successful outcome: the world had agreed, at last, to make concrete plans to limit global heating to 1.5C. True, the deal reached in Glasgow was fragile. Most countries came to the Cop26 climate summit without carbon-cutting plans of the level of stringency scientists said was needed. They left the talks with targets that would imply heating of about 1.9C - a 'historic' achievement compared to the 6C of heating we were heading towards a decade ago, but still far off 1.5C, the figure scientists say is the threshold of safety. That left plenty to do in the months to come. Alok Sharma, the UK cabinet minister who presided over Cop26, summed up the agreement soon after as one that was 'on life support'. He wrote in the Guardian: 'The 1.5C limit lives. We brought it back from the brink. But its pulse remains weak.' But the pace and brutality of the geopolitical changes since mid-November have been to a climate deal on life support like a cluster bomb dropped on a hospital. In just six months, a world slowly recovering from a pandemic has been wracked by war which, in turn, has created chaos in energy markets, sent food prices surging and threatened shortages, raised inflation and the spectre of recession and unrest, and has upended geopolitical relations. Fossil fuel companies are enjoying a bonanza when they were supposed to be dying out. World leaders, who six months ago were pledging net zero carbon emissions, are now licensing new oil and gas drilling. Coal demand has surged and investors are sitting on scores of 'carbon bombs' - high-stakes oil, gas and coal projects that, if followed through, would eliminate any hope of a 1.5C world. It would be easy to think of the Glasgow climate deal and the chance of a 1.5C limit as another casualty of Vladimir Putin's invasion and brutal war. Russia is the world's biggest exporter of oil and gas, and one of the largest sources of minerals and coal. Putin has shown he is prepared to weaponise that dominance for his own ends, whatever the consequences. But it is not quite that simple, and perhaps not quite that bad. 'Things haven't fallen apart,' says John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy on climate. 'This is not easy, but it hasn't fallen apart. It has met with an unexpected barrier, the war, and it has met with an unfortunate and dangerous resurgence of business as usual by some parties, that threatens the acceleration necessary to get the job done. It's going to be up to us to push back and continue with the process.' Six months from now, the world will meet again for the next round of climate talks in Egypt, which is yet to set out a clear programme. Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a UN climate adviser, says that Cop27 must focus on 'implementation, implementation, implementation'. That means ensuring that the promises made in Glasgow are not forgotten about or fought over, but put into practice as swiftly as possible. 'Putting off tomorrow that which needs to be done today has come back to bite us,' she says. 'Decades of under-investment in infrastructure, of too slow progress on protecting nature, faltering responses to rising inequality, undervaluing energy efficiency. Now we find ourselves scrambling to swing away from fossil fuels, ramp up renewables, respond to famine and food price shocks and with inflation on the rise and growth stalling, and very little of the policy frameworks we need to make the transitions move smoothly at speed. 2021 was about ambition - 2022 is about following through.' But the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has upended expectations for 2022, and nothing is quite as expected. Russia is likely to attend Cop27, whatever the state of the invasion by autumn. Egypt has long been friendly to Russia which, along with Ukraine, supplies most of the country's grain. Thirty years of climate negotiations have seen and weathered plenty of previous conflicts, and insiders say countries are practised at keeping discussions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the parent treaty to the Paris agreement, separate from other geopolitical upheavals. Outright hostility at the summit is unlikely. A worse danger is the 'indifference' and 'love of the status quo' Kerry fears countries are reverting to, under cover of the war. For the countries that want progress, the key will be to keep international focus on the effects of the Ukraine crisis on national security in the developed world, and of the climate crisis in the developing world, such as the record heatwaves in India and Pakistan. Soaring energy prices as a result of the invasion have prompted a rapid reappraisal of energy policies across the world, particularly in Europe. Before the invasion, Germany depended on Russia for about two-thirds of its gas supplies, and the EU for about 40%. The bloc's attempts to wean itself off these sources are likely to be painful in the short term, but have accelerated a move that needed to be made in the long term to reach the target of net zero emissions by 2050. There are three clear answers to this energy crisis, according to Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, and one of the world's foremost energy economists: countries must seek to replace Russian fossil fuels in the short term by squeezing more out of their current supplies. Urgent measures, such as turning down thermostats, imposing speed limits on cars and installing home insulation, must be taken to cut down on demand. And renewable energy must be ramped up fast by removing barriers such as planning problems and grid connections. 'I believe we have the chance to make this a historic turning point, towards a cleaner and more secure energy system,' said Birol. 'This is the first time I have seen such momentum behind change in the energy sector.' This optimistic view depends on countries seizing the opportunities of renewables and ignoring the pleas of big oil, however. Fossil fuel companies have pledged to plough a proportion of their cash into clean energy, but many are just as likely to pour it into fresh extraction. The Guardian has uncovered nearly 200 examples of new fossil fuel projects now under development that, if brought to fruition, would result in a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, or about 18 years of emissions at current levels. That would put paid to any hope of staying within 1.5C. Support for renewable energy, however, may come from a new and unexpected quarter. Soaring energy prices, and the accompanying high food prices, threaten social stability. Energy has become a political and economic weapon wielded by Russia against Europe, and dependence on fossil fuels has been revealed as a vital strategic vulnerability. Vladimir Putin has succeeded where decades of argument from green campaigners failed: he has made generals and national defence chiefs around the world see that the climate crisis is a national security priority. Birol notes: 'National security is now a very important driver, and this makes a very powerful combination, with the economic factors, in leading towards clean energy.' Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Republic of the Marshall Islands, who played a key role at Cop26 in bringing together the High Ambition Coalition, agrees, and says developing countries must press home this argument. 'I hope that it is now clear that investing in renewable energy is an investment not just in energy but also in resilience and political independence,' she told the Guardian. 'The evidence that climate is a national security issue is mounting higher and higher.' Countries must also understand that their vulnerability to energy shocks is inevitable as long as they rely on fossil fuels, even if the current crisis is resolved, says Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who presided over the Paris agreement who is now a founding partner of the thinktank Global Optimism . 'Fossil fuel prices will always be affected by geopolitical swings,' she says. 'Some would have us think these events are black swans - improbable, hard-to-predict events. But this is not so. The volatility of fossil fuel prices is constant and pernicious.' While Europe appears to be moving towards cleaner energy, the US is facing a continued logjam in Congress. Legislation proposed by Joe Biden, crucial to fulfilling the promises he made in Glasgow on reducing emissions, is stuck because of the refusal of one Democratic Senator, Joe Manchin, to agree. 'It's depressing,' says Emmanuel Guerin, executive director for the international group at the European Climate Foundation. 'It is not a rosy picture. I don't want to pretend [the Ukraine war] is a crisis that can be easily turned into an opportunity.' Nevertheless, the Biden administration is determined to push forward, according to Kerry. 'I'm hopeful that in the next weeks maybe Congress can be able to pass some kind of climate legislation, which will be helpful,' he says. 'President Biden is committed to moving forward and obviously he has administrative powers and can issue certain executive orders and do certain things.' Meanwhile, this year has already seen record heatwaves in India and Pakistan that have caused widespread misery, disruption, damage to crops and fears for people's health. These devastating events are happening at 1.2C of global heating and, according to new research from the Met Office and the World Meteorological Organisation, we are likely to see global temperatures top 1.5C above pre-industrial levels within the next five years. That does not spell the end of the 1.5C goal - temperatures could overshoot the limit in some years without settling above it for the long term - but the conclusions are inescapable. The kind of disasters we are seeing in South Asia, the flooding in Australia and South Africa, and the droughts and wildfires in North America will rapidly become the norm, with consequences for humanity that will far outstrip the effects of any war yet experienced. In the final moments of Cop26, Frans Timmermans, vice-president of the EU Commission, brandished a picture of his one-year-old grandson, Kees, warning that by 2050 the boy would be 'fighting with other human beings for water and food' if the talks failed. That image, like the heart-rending images of children living through the war in Ukraine, holds the key to comprehending, and acting on, the problem. 'In Sharm El-Sheikh, we need to see progress on the commitments made in Glasgow,' Timmermans told the Guardian. 'This is about humanity's very survival, and the future of our children and grandchildren. My grandson Kees is now walking around. We have all the tools we need to make this happen. So let's use them.'", "80a97a0e4de1bb361c80bb36c96b031ceb1107fbd814a1a1d90f48a7": "Cuba's parliament has approved a new penal code officials say modernizes the country's laws but human rights groups warn tightens already strict limits on dissent. The law approved late on Sunday controls unauthorized contacts with foreign organizations and individuals and explicitly bans foreign financing. Supreme court president Ruben Remigio Ferro called it 'a modern, very inclusive code', telling state television that it favors 'prevention and education before repression' while imposing 'sanctions with sufficient rigor' against crimes that affect 'social peace and the stability of our nation'. It will take effect after going to a drafting commission and then being published in the official gazette. Cuban authorities have never had trouble punishing dissent they see as dangerous. Hundreds of people were arrested for taking part in July 2021 protests across the island and some were sentenced to 20 years in prison on charges such as sedition. Independent journalists have sometimes been jailed on various charges, often choosing eventually to leave the island. Under the new law, penalties of 10 to 30 years - in extreme cases even death - can be imposed on those who give information to international organizations, associations or even people who have not been authorized by the government. It eliminates the vague, widely offense of 'precriminal dangerousness' that was sometimes used against dissidents, but creates new categories of crimes. Those who insult or attack officials or civilians who are doing their 'citizens' duty' can be imprisoned for up to five years. A similar punishment can be imposed on those who 'incite' against socialist order - and 10 years for those who use communications media to do so. Among the most questioned clauses is the ban on any unauthorized financing from international or domestic sources that contributes to the commission of a crime. That section does not affect remittances from Cubans living abroad. 'With the new penal code, Cuban authorities continue to build an intricate and perverse legal regime of censorship and deal a devastating blow to independent journalists and outlets,' said Ana Cristina Nunez, the senior researcher for Latin American and the Caribbean for the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. The new code reinforces penalties for corruption, speculation and hoarding. Despite some complaints, it maintains a potential death penalty for 23 crimes - though that has not been applied since 2003 - and adds to sentences when crimes involve gender violence or crimes against minors and disabled people. The age of criminal responsibility remains at 16. This law 'is a more direct way for the government to armor itself against civil society, against political dissidence,' said Saily Gonzalez, an activist prominent in monitoring response to the 2021 protests. The lawmakers declined to include a measure backed by Mariela Castro, daughter of former President Raul Castro, to make femicide an explicit crime. Another deputy, Teresa Amarelle, leader of the Federation of Cuban Woman said that was not needed because of newly toughened punishment against gender violence.", "92be8409622528852d7d8ec46abe2e0dcc0f78da7cd0bb3640d2dd3b": "Taliban authorities in Afghanistan dissolved five key departments of the former US-backed government, including the country's human rights commission, deeming them unnecessary in the face of a financial crunch, an official said. Afghanistan faced a budget deficit of 44bn Afghanis ($501m) this financial year, Taliban authorities said as they announced their first annual national budget since taking over last August. 'Because these departments were not deemed necessary and were not included in the budget, they have been dissolved,' said Innamullah Samangani, the Taliban government's deputy spokesperson. Also dissolved was the high council for national reconciliation (HCNR), the once high-powered national security council, and the commission for overseeing the implementation of the Afghan constitution. The HCNR was last headed by former Afghan president Abdullah Abdullah, and was working to negotiate a peace between the US-backed government of former president Ashraf Ghani and the then-insurgent Taliban. In August 2021, 20 years after invading Afghanistan, foreign forces withdrew leading to the collapse of the government and a Taliban takeover. Samangani said the national budget was 'based on objective facts' and intended only for departments that had been active and productive. He added that the bodies could be reactivated in the future 'if needed'. After taking over in 2021, the Taliban assured the world they would be more moderate. However, they are yet to allow older girls to restart education, and have also introduced rules that mandate that women and girls wear veils and requiring them to have male relatives accompany them in public places.", "d33be2f7fe2adc39dfd1cbc27d51000cafc0212bb472ff8366d714b0": "The UK's hottest day of the year so far is expected on Tuesday, with spells of sunshine across the country and temperatures forecast to rise to 26 degrees in London offering an early glimpse of summer. The Met Office said the hottest temperatures would be in south-east England as a plume of warm air arrives from the continent, although much of the country will have warm weather. The temperatures are expected to break the record set so far this year of 23.6C recorded in Faversham, Kent on 6 May. Average highs for the south of England in May are 17 degrees, although Met Office spokesperson Ollie Claydon said temperatures in the late-20s were not unusual, especially towards the end of the month. He added the forecast did not constitute a heatwave, which the Met Office defines as three successive days of temperatures above 28 degrees. However, not all regions will see blue skies. A band of rain is passing across Northern Ireland, where temperatures will reach about 14 degrees in Belfast and will become more widespread and heavier across the west and then the north, bringing winds and a cooler feel. In south-east England, the good weather is set to continue on Wednesday, with fresher temperatures and some showers arriving on Thursday, bringing temperatures down to the early 20s over the weekend. Most parts of the UK will have above-average temperatures for May over the week, but blue skies will be broken up with potentially heavy or thundery showers, especially in the north and west.Claydon said the outlook for next week remained 'borderline' as high pressure was looking to make its way in to the UK over the weekend, but it was unclear whether it would succeed.Towards the end of May, the Met Office is predicting lots of fine and dry weather, with near-average temperatures and more summery spells in the east and south-east.NHS hot weather advice recommends that people stay cool indoors, stay hydrated, keep out of the sun between 11am and 3pm, apply sunscreen regularly and avoid exercising in the hottest parts of the day.", "e7260eef18e30dabf6a44f9051ca88f44cd90661952de2f51202673d": "Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. Regular pay in the UK continues to lag behind inflation, as workers - particularly in the public sector - are hit by the cost of living squeeze, even as the unemployment rate hits the lowest since 1974. Figures just released by the Office for National Statistics show that regular pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 4.2% per year in the three months to March.  That means basic pay shrank in real terms, as CPI inflation hit 7% in March, and may have soared over 9% in April. But total pay was stronger up - up 7% per year, with bonuses swelling some pay packets. The Office for National Statistics reports that: Today's labour market report also shows a stark difference between workers in the public and private sector.  Average total pay growth for the private sector was 8.2%, but just 1.6% for the public sector.  The finance and business services sector showed the largest growth rate (10.7%), partly because of strong bonus payments, the ONS says. The jobs report also shows that the UK's unemployment rate dropped from 3.8% to 3.7% -- the lowest since 1974. The UK's employment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points on the quarter to 75.7%, while the number of job vacancies remained at a record high.  The data comes a day after Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey reiterated his call for workers to show restraint on wage rises, particularly the better paid. Bailey told MPs: Unions hit back at Bailey, with Unite saying he should not 'lecture' workers about wage restraint. TUC Deputy General Secretary Paul Nowak pointed out that: With the cost of living crisis intensifying, the CBI is calling for immediate assistance for 'people facing real hardship', adding to the pressure on the government to help those hardest hit by Britain's cost of living crisis. CBI Director-General, Tony Danker, said the Government must move on two fronts right away. European stock markets are set to open higher: In the financial markets, sterling is strengthening against major currencies after UK unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to a 48-year low of 3.7%. The pound is up 1.5 cents against the US dollar to $1.247, its highest level since tumbling almost two weeks ago when the Bank of England slashed its growth forecasts. Sterling is up a cent against the euro too, at EUR1.19. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, says traders are expecting further UK interest rate rises, with inflation forecast to have hit 9% in April. Elon Musk's deal to buy Twitter is looking increasingly troubled. The billionaire has tweeted that the deal, agreed last month, 'cannot go forward' unless company can show that less than 5% of accounts are fake or spam.  Yesterday, Musk suggested that he could seek to pay a lower price for Twitter, as he expressed further concerns about the presence of fake accounts on the platform. The Tesla CEO said reducing his agreed $54.20 per share offer wouldn't be 'out of the question', days after putting the $44bn ($36bn) deal 'on hold' after he queried the number of spam accounts on Twitter. Musk told the All-In Summit in Miami that the deal going through depended on Twitter's response to his concerns about fake accounts.'It really depends on a lot of factors here,' he said in comments reported by the Financial Times.  Musk also failed to distinguish himself with an exchange with Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal over spam on the platform: Twitter's share price fell 8% yesterday, to $37.39, back to levels before Musk revealed he has build a stake in the company, and then launched his $54.20 per share offer.  They're down another 1.7% today in premarket trading at $36.70, as traders conclude the deal is very unlikely to happen at the original price, or possibly at all. Today's jobs report shows that there are around 460,000 more people 'economically inactive' than before the pandemic -- neither in work, nor looking for a job. The total economically inactive rose by by 65,000 in January-March, to 8.829m. As this chart shows, there has been a rise in long-term sickness, as well as in people leaving the jobs market to care for family: Many of those are over 50s, as Emily Andrews, Deputy Director for Work at the Centre for Ageing Better, explains:  Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, says there is a recruitment crisis: Back on the UK jobs report, and Resolution Foundation's Torsten Bell points out that real regular pay is falling at the fastest pace in a decade, in the tightest jobs market on record: M&S chairman Archie Norman also warned that food price inflation in Britain could hit 10% this year. He told Radio 4's Today programme that global prices are rising, such as wheat and freight costs, oil and energy, so all retailers will 'reluctantly' have to lift their prices. But will it be an 'apocalyptic' extent, as Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned yesterday? Norman says he wouldn't use that term -- but concedes it will be a tough time for consumers. It will be 'very negative for consumer discretionary income', but not apocalyptic, at least not for M&S's customers, Norman adds. The chairman of Marks & Spencer has backed the British government's efforts to make changes to the Northern Ireland protocol.  Archie Norman told the Today Programme that M&S is in the front line of the problem at the UK border since Brexit, which is adding to its costs and creating much more paperwork.  It has to close its French business because of customs rules, and it is proving very tough to make its business in the Republic of Ireland work, he says. Norman explains the new frictions at the borders, following Brexit. At the moment, M&S wagons arriving in the Republic have to carry 700 pages of documentation covering the items on board, which takes eight hours to prepare. Some of the descriptors, particularly of animal products, have to be written in Latin, and in a certain typeface, Norman says.  M&S employs 13 vets in Motherwell to prepare it all, and it pushes up driver time by 30% -- meaning it all costs around PS30m. Currently, there's an easement in Northern Ireland, so the controls aren't the same. But the EU are looking for comparable controls to be introduced. Were that to happen, Norman says, 'quite a lot of products' wouldn't get to Northern Ireland, and what did get in would be very expensive. Right now, Norman says, it is managing to supply Northern Ireland without a shortfall, although it costs more money. The paperwork for Northern Ireland takes one hour, compared with eight for Dublin. Norman (a former Conservative MP) argues that tougher safety checks on shipments to Northern Ireland aren't needed, as UK food standards by law, are 'equivalent or higher' than in the EU. The Commission want every product from Great Britain going into Northern Ireland to be labelled as being meant for UK consumption only -- that would cost M&S PS9m per year, Norman says, and be impossible for small producers. Q: Do you think, why on earth did the UK sign up to this? Norman argues that EU is obsessed with the letter of the rules, while the UK looks at the the purpose of the rules. Q: So should the UK try and agree a shorter, time-limited deal? Norman suggests that train has 'left the station', and the priority now is to solve the problem on Northern Ireland, so its people get the food they deserve and require. Soaring inflation means the wage squeeze is going to get 'far worse', even though some firms are paying bonuses to attract or hold onto staff in a tight labour market. So warns Hannah Slaughter, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: Jonathan Boys, labour market economist for the CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, is struck by the wide gap between public and private sector pay growth. The drop in the unemployment rate to 3.7%, and the record vacancies, shows firms are strugging to hire workers, says the Institute of Directors. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the IoD, said: Labour are also calling for an emergency budget.  Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, says: There are fresh calls for an emergency budget to help workers, after basic pay fell further behind inflation. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady says millions of working families are at breaking point: Ben Harrison, Director of the Work Foundation think tank at Lancaster University, says the government should help the poorest families, by uprating benefits in line with the surge in inflation. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, says he knows it's an anxious time -- but still hasn't announced any fresh help with the cost of living squeeze. Sunak says: But groups from charities to the CBI insist that more help is needed. Action for Children, for example, has warned this morning that strugging families are skipping meals, wearing coats indoors to stay warm, and living in the dark because they can't afford energy bills. In one case, it said, a boy it worked with had been off school with sore feet caused by chilblains: Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), says the UK labour market is a 'mixed picture'. Although unemployment has dropped, underlying regular earnings are 'now falling sharply in real terms.' (ie, after inflation).  The number of UK workers on payrolls continues to hit new highs, rising by 121,000 between March and April to 29.5 million. BUT.... there are still more than half a million fewer people in employment than before the pandemic, at 32.569m people (up 83,000 in the last quarter). Total job-to-job moves increased to a record high of 994,000 in January-March, today's jobs report says, 'driven by resignations rather than dismissals'. For the first time since records began, there are fewer unemployed people than job vacancies, says the ONS. While the unemployment rate dropped to 3.7%, the lowest since 1974, the number of job vacancies in February to April 2022 rose to a new record of 1,295,000. That's 33,700 more than in the previous quarter and an increase of 499,300 from the pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic level in January to March 2020. The ONS says: That could encourage the Bank of England to keep raising interest rates in the coming months, to prevent a wage-price spiral: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. Regular pay in the UK continues to lag behind inflation, as workers - particularly in the public sector - are hit by the cost of living squeeze, even as the unemployment rate hits the lowest since 1974. Figures just released by the Office for National Statistics show that regular pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 4.2% per year in the three months to March.  That means basic pay shrank in real terms, as CPI inflation hit 7% in March, and may have soared over 9% in April. But total pay was stronger up - up 7% per year, with bonuses swelling some pay packets. The Office for National Statistics reports that: Today's labour market report also shows a stark difference between workers in the public and private sector.  Average total pay growth for the private sector was 8.2%, but just 1.6% for the public sector.  The finance and business services sector showed the largest growth rate (10.7%), partly because of strong bonus payments, the ONS says. The jobs report also shows that the UK's unemployment rate dropped from 3.8% to 3.7% -- the lowest since 1974. The UK's employment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points on the quarter to 75.7%, while the number of job vacancies remained at a record high.  The data comes a day after Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey reiterated his call for workers to show restraint on wage rises, particularly the better paid. Bailey told MPs: Unions hit back at Bailey, with Unite saying he should not 'lecture' workers about wage restraint. TUC Deputy General Secretary Paul Nowak pointed out that: With the cost of living crisis intensifying, the CBI is calling for immediate assistance for 'people facing real hardship', adding to the pressure on the government to help those hardest hit by Britain's cost of living crisis. CBI Director-General, Tony Danker, said the Government must move on two fronts right away.

An advisory issued by the state and treasury departments and the FBI said the effort was intended to circumvent US and UN sanctions, and bring in money for North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. The officials said companies who hired and paid such workers may be exposing themselves to legal consequences for sanctions violations. 'There are thousands of DPRK IT workers both dispatched overseas and located within the DPRK, generating revenue that is remitted back to the North Korean government. 'These IT workers take advantage of existing demands for specific IT skills, such as software and mobile application development, to obtain freelance employment contracts from clients around the world, including in North America, Europe, and east Asia.' North Korean workers pretended to be from South Korea, Japan, or other Asian countries, the advisory said. It laid out a series of red flags that employers should watch for, including a refusal to participate in video calls and requests to receive payments in virtual currency. US officials said the North Koreans were mostly based in China and Russia, with smaller numbers operating out of Africa and south-east Asia. Much of the money they earned was taken by the North Korean government. The advisory says that while much of the surreptitious job-seeking is to earn foreign exchange or to access virtual currency exchanges, some of the workers have helped Pyongyang's government-backed hacking operations. The workers also 'may steal the customer account information of US or international banks to verify their identities with freelance platforms, payment providers, and companies employing' contract workers, it said. Hiring the North Koreans 'poses many risks, ranging from theft of intellectual property, data, and funds to reputational harm and legal consequences, including sanctions under both US and United Nations authorities', it said.

For years, the country has been plagued by a runaway housing market. The cities of Wellington and Auckland have some of the least affordable property markets in the world, and homeownership rates have been falling since the early 1990s across all age brackets, but especially for people in their 20s and 30s. Now, New Zealand is in the midst of some of the largest drops and slowdowns since the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The number of houses sold in April was down 30% from the month prior, according to the Real Estate Institute and, according to Westpac, prices fell by 1.1% in April - now down 5% from their peaks in November. Price drops and supply increases will be welcome news for prospective buyers, but recent first homebuyers who spent up large now to own an asset that is less valuable, and increasing interest rates due to inflation, could make paying off a hefty mortgage more challenging, as a cost of living crisis also bites. Two of the country's largest banks, Westpac and ASB, have now both sounded the alarm about dramatic drops in house prices over the next year, with ASB economists citing the 'three big housing nasties' as the reason behind the receding prices: tighter credit conditions, higher mortgage rates and increased supply of new housing. 'However, the bulk of the house price impact from the mortgage rate surge is yet to come. About 60% of all mortgages rates will be reset over the coming 12 months,' ASB said. Interest rates could nearly double for some households, ASB economists said, but it does not expect the change to lead to widespread mortgage distress or forced sales. 'But the rate shock will siphon a bunch of extra disposable income out of Kiwis' wallets this year, hitting discretionary retail spending hard.' Westpac's acting chief economist, Michael Gordon, told news website Stuff that while 20% sounded like a big drop, it would put prices back only on par with where they were at the start of 2021. Median house prices rose 31% in the year to July 2021. 'That illustrates the ferocity of the rise in house prices during what turned out to be a brief period of super-low interest rates,' he said. Gordon added that increasing incomes and a rise in household savings would take the edge off a downturn. 'The slowdown we're forecasting looks more likely to be a soft landing, rather than a crash.'", "152a34ad4a47dae884224eb495bcadb31afba28cab7141e52ccc9f09": "The images of a besuited Ferdinand Marcos Jr, clad in a top hat and leaning nonchalantly on a Rolls-Royce, dating from his time in Britain in the 1970s are as you may expect from the playboy scion of a kleptocratic dictator. Yet as the Marcos family returns to power in the Philippines after a landslide presidential victory by Marcos Jr, he is facing calls to stop misrepresenting the circumstances of his studies at Oxford. The university has confirmed that he did not complete his BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics after enrolling in 1975. 'According to our records, he did not complete his degree, but was awarded a special diploma in social studies in 1978,' Oxford said in a response to a freedom of information request lodged by a UK-based Filipina supporter of Marcos Jr's nearest rival in last week's election. Marcos Jr, nicknamed 'Bongbong', has claimed in interviews that Oxford issued him with a bachelor's degree, while his official spokesperson has said that the politician and his team 'stand by the degree confirmation which was issued by the University of Oxford'. His website states: 'He completed his undergraduate studies at Oxford University and graduated with a special diploma in social studies.' But a UK-based Filipina supporter of Marcos Jr's rival Leni Robredo, who lodged the FoI request, said of Marcos: 'He should stop misrepresenting his special diploma, which is clearly not a degree. It's clear he did not complete undergraduate studies.' She added: 'In the grand scheme of things, it may not seem so important, as our constitution states that presidential candidates only have to be literate and be a citizen of a certain age. But it's a big thing in the Philippines if you have studied abroad and people are impressed by that. What he has been saying about that is a reflection on his personality and character. It's also a reflection of a pattern of disinformation that a lot of researchers have pointed out recently.' After years of rebranding its image, the Marcos family seems to be back in power. Ongoing counts on Friday also showed that his political allies were set to capture most of the 300-seat House of Representatives and half of the 24-seat senate, which was also up for election. Marcos Jr received more than 31 million votes in the unofficial count, with projections showing one of the largest majorities in decades. The result comes after an onslaught of disinformation designed to revise history, enhance the reputation of the family and undermine their opponents. The issue of Marcos Jr's Oxford degree first emerged seven years ago when his profile on the website for the Philippines senate stated that he had obtained an Oxford degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). Newly published letters last year revealed that the envoys for his father had lobbied senior figures at Oxford University's St Edmund Hall to preserve the son's academic career after he failed examinations on a number of occasions. After university, Marcos Jr became the vice-governor of his home province, Ilocos Norte, on the north-western tip of Luzon, at the age of 23, and later governor. He was 29 when his father - who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989 - was ousted and the family was forced to leave the Philippines. Previously published documents revealed that Marcos failed two of his three preliminary exams at Oxford in the summer of 1976, later doing only enough to pass one of two resits - failing politics for a second time. Discussions followed between emissaries of Marcos Sr and John Kelly, the principal of St Edmund Hall, who was asked if they could 'think of any special circumstances which would warrant the college departing from its normal rule'. A deal was eventually hammered out in which Marcos was allowed to continue his PPE studies but was transferred to a special diploma in social sciences, a programme that has since been discontinued.  Marcos Jr is not the only famous person to have presented a well-seasoned CV.", "096140916ac3b2003fd15af93dcce7dd944fe16cdc62e2ae8c1d4624": "The US's most powerful pro-Israel lobby group is pouring millions of dollars into influencing Democratic congressional primary races to counter growing support for the Palestinian cause within the party, including elections today in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee's money is focused on blocking female candidates who, if elected, are likely to align with 'the squad' of progressive members of congress who have been critical of Israel. But it is funneled through a group, the United Democracy Project (UDP), that avoids mention of its creation by Aipac and seeks to decide elections by funding campaign messages about issues other than Israel. The UDP has thrown $2.3m in to Tuesday's Democratic primary race for an open congressional seat in Pennsylvania - one of a handful of contests targeted by the group where a leading candidate is overtly sympathetic to the Palestinians. The money has mostly been spent in support of a former Republican congressional staffer turned Democrat, Steve Irwin, in an attempt to block a progressive state representative, Summer Lee, who is leading in opinion polls in the solidly Democratic district which includes Pittsburgh. Lee has spoken in support of setting conditions for the US's considerable aid to Israel, has accused Israel of 'atrocities' in Gaza, and has drawn parallels between Israeli actions and the shooting of young black men in the US. She is endorsed by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, members of 'the squad' who support the Palestinian cause. Irwin has defended Israeli government policies and questioned whether Lee has 'a strong conviction that Israel has a right to exist'. The UDP has also spent $2m in support of North Carolina state senator Valeria Foushee in today's Democratic primary in an attempt to block Nida Allam, the political director of Senator Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign and the first Muslim American woman to hold elected office in North Carolina. Allam has participated in pro-Palestinian rallies and has been endorsed by members of the squad. She has also spoken out against antisemitism. Aipac launched the UDP in December as a super political action committee, or Super Pac, which is permitted to spend without restriction in support of candidates but cannot make direct donations to campaigns. The lobby group's move into financial support for political campaigns for the first time in its 70 year history was prompted by alarm in Washington and Israel at the erosion of longstanding bipartisan support for the Jewish state in the US. Opinion polls show younger Democrats are growing more critical of Israel, including American Jews, and that there is rising support for the Boycott, Sanctions and Divest (BDS) movement. Israel is also concerned by the breaking of a longstanding taboo on comparing Israel's domination of the Palestinians to apartheid South Africa after the publication of a series of international and Israeli human rights groups reports accusing Israel of practicing a form of apartheid. The UDP has also spent $1.2m to protect the Texas Democratic congressman, Henry Cuellar, who faces a run-off later next week against Jessica Cisneros, a 28-year-old immigration lawyer who has spoken in support of the Palestinians and is endorsed by members of the squad. Cuellar is described as an ally by Aipac and co-founded the Congressional Caucus for the Advancement of Torah Values to combat 'anti-Israel bigotry'. After Amnesty International joined other human rights groups in accusing Israel of imposing apartheid, Cuellar accused the group of endangering Jews. 'Israel is not an apartheid state. Full stop. These inaccuracies incite antisemitic behavior against the Jewish people,' he tweeted. A smaller and more liberal pro-Israel group, J-Street, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of Cisneros, saying she is committed to a more just solution to the conflict with the Palestinians. J-Street's spokesperson, Logan Bayroff, accused Aipac of being a Republican front organisation that strongly supported Donald Trump, and of attempting to intimidate candidates into avoiding criticism of Israel by implicitly threatening to fund campaigns against them. 'Aipac are taking all this money from Republican donors, and they're obfuscating the fact that they're a very Republican-aligned organisation while trying to persuade Democratic voters who they should support,' he said. 'The United Democracy Project sounds innocuous and the advertising that they're running in these districts is about healthcare and reproductive rights and things that have nothing to do with Israel. Which makes sense because those are the things that decide elections, not Israel. But the reason that they're aligning with certain candidates is because they are more aligned with their more hawkish positions on Israel, and because they fear that other candidates will be more progressive and aligned with the Palestinians.' A UDP spokesman, Patrick Dorton, said the group was doing no more than running legitimate political advertising. 'All we are doing is talking about candidate's public record and that is something voters deserve to know,' he said. Dorton said the group will be funding more campaigns. 'Our goal is to build the broadest bipartisan coalition in congress that supports the US-Israel relationship. We are proud to support pro-Israel progressive candidates including women of color,' he said. 'We are looking at 10 to 15 other races where there is a pro-Israel candidate and a candidate that, if elected, would undermine the US-Israel relationship.' Earlier this year, Aipac was accused by other leading supporters of Israel of being 'morally bankrupt' and of putting Israel's interests ahead of American democracy after it launched a separate political action committee that endorsed 37 Republicans candidates who voted against certifying Biden's victory after the 6 January 2021 storming of the Capitol. Aipac said that it supports politicians from both parties who will 'advance the US-Israel relationship. 'It requires bipartisan support in Congress to adopt legislation that would advance that relationship. Consequently, we support members from both parties in their election races. In addition to the Republicans we have supported, we have made contributions to over 120 House Democrats, including half of the Congressional Black Caucus, half of the House Progressive Caucus, and the top Democratic leaders in the House,' Aipac said in a statement.", "320ab4ea16d16809abddfbd077e8beb258cce8e89f7f0f035c323116": "The French city of Grenoble has authorised the wearing of the burkini in state-run swimming pools, reigniting one of France's most contentious debates on religious dress. The all-in-one swimsuit, used by some Muslim women to cover their bodies and hair while bathing, has become a controversial talking point during the holiday season in recent years. It is prohibited in most state-run pools, where strict swimwear rules apply to all, including men, who are required to wear tight-fitting trunks. The move applies across the board, meaning that men will able to wear long shorts and women can also bathe topless in the Alpine city's pools. Grenoble's mayor, Eric Piolle, one of the country's highest-profile Green politicians, who leads a broad leftwing coalition at the city council, championed the move, but ran into a fierce campaign of opposition. He managed to rally enough votes at a city council meeting to approve the measure, despite not having the support of his own EELV party, which distanced itself from the measure. It was carried by the slimmest of margins with 29 votes for, 27 against and 2 abstentions after two and a half hours of tense debates. 'All we want is for women and men to be able to dress how they want,' Piolle told broadcaster RMC on Monday. Opponents see it differently, including the influential conservative head of the wider Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region, Laurent Wauquiez, who has promised to withdraw funding from the city. 'I am convinced that what M Piolle is defending is a dreadful dead end for our country,' Wauquiez said at the beginning of May, accusing him of 'doing deals with political Islam' to 'buy votes'. At the council meeting, the former rightwing mayor Alain Carignon urged a local referendum on the issue. 'You can't force through such a sensitive subject. You have no legitimacy, you weren't elected for that,' he said. The regional spat has put the burkini back in the headlines nationally, animating French talkshows and the political class ahead of parliamentary elections next month. The issue of how people dress for the pool touches on highly sensitive topics in France, including fears about the influence of Islam and threats to the country's cherished secularism. 'It seems to me that [Piolle] doesn't realise the harm he is doing to our Republican values,' Prisca Thevenot, a spokeswoman for President Emmanuel Macron's party, told Radio J on Monday. 'This would be breaking with the rules to respond to political desires based on religion,' she added. Attempts by several local mayors in the south of France to ban the burkini on Mediterranean beaches in the summer of 2016 kicked off the first firestorm around the bathing suit. The rules, introduced after a string of terror attacks in France, were eventually struck down as discriminatory. Three years later, a group of women in Grenoble caused a splash by forcing their way into a pool with burkinis, leading the prime minister at the time to insist that the rules should be followed. French sports brand Decathlon also found itself at the centre of a similar row in 2019 when it announced plans to sell a 'sports hijab' enabling Muslim women to cover their hair while running. Grenoble is not be the first to change its rules, however. The northwestern city of Rennes quietly updated its pool code in 2019 to allow burkinis and other types of swimwear.

But Newsom also directed some of his most pointed remarks toward fellow Democrats. 'Where the hell is my party? Where's the Democratic party?' Newsom said. 'This is a concerted, coordinated effort, and yes, they're winning. They are. They have been. Let's acknowledge that. We need to stand up. Where's the counter-offensive?' Even as Democrats have denounced the court's provisional decision to overturn Roe and vowed to defend abortion rights, their efforts at the federal level have largely failed to live up to their rhetoric. A vote last Wednesday in the Senate to codify Roe and protect abortion rights nationwide was once again blocked, as Democrat Joe Manchin joined all 50 Republican senators in opposing the bill. The failure of Democrats in Washington to shore up abortion rights, even as they control the White House and both chambers of Congress, has complicated the party's messaging to voters about the likely end of Roe. Some frustrated Democrats are instead turning their attention to state and local policies that could protect reproductive rights even if Roe falls. Abortion rights supporters' frustration with Democratic inaction at the federal level has been on display since the draft opinion leaked earlier this month. At a protest outside the supreme court last week, abortion rights demonstrators chanted: 'Do something, Democrats.' Progressive members of Congress have also argued for the urgent need to pass federal abortion rights legislation, calling on senators to amend the filibuster to get a bill approved. 'People elected Democrats precisely so we could lead in perilous moments like these - to codify Roe, hold corruption accountable, [and] have a President who uses his legal authority to break through Congressional gridlock on items from student debt to climate,' progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter.  The stakes of Democratic inaction are high, as abortion is certain or likely to be outlawed in 26 states if the court follows through with overturning Roe. Last weekend, the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, warned that Republicans may go even further if they regain control of the White House and Congress, floating the idea of a national abortion ban. Republicans would probably face widespread public outcry if they advanced a nationwide ban. A poll %09https:/www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_051122/'>released by Monmouth University last week found that just 9% of Americans support the idea of a national ban, while 64% support keeping abortion legal. However, abortion rights advocates warn that the threat of a nationwide ban will be real if Republicans take back Congress and the White House. 'Republicans are definitely passing a national abortion ban once they have the power to do it,' said Shaunna Thomas, co-founder and executive director of the reproductive rights group UltraViolet. 'They've been signaling they were going to pack the supreme court in order to overturn Roe. I don't think people took them seriously enough. And so people really need to learn the lesson here and take them very, very seriously on this point.' Progressive groups like UltraViolet have called on Democrats to amend the Senate filibuster, which would allow a bill codifying Roe to get through the upper chamber with a simple majority of support. But Manchin and fellow Democrat Kyrsten Sinema have made it clear they will not support a filibuster carve-out, and the vote last Wednesday failed to even attract the 50 votes that would be necessary if the Senate rules were changed. 'Our constitutional right to abortion has to be more important than their loyalty to arcane Senate procedures that are not even laws,' Thomas said. 'People watched them carve the filibuster out to raise the debt ceiling. If they can do it for that, they should be able to do it for this.' Democratic congressional leaders have encouraged members of their party to direct their criticism toward Republicans rather than each other. In a 'Dear colleague' letter to House Democrats last week, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, warned of Republicans' wish for a national abortion ban and said their policies could even 'criminalize contraceptive care, in vitro fertilization and post-miscarriage care'. 'Make no mistake: once Republicans have dispensed with precedent and privacy in overturning Roe, they will take aim at additional basic human rights,' Pelosi said.  Christina Reynolds, vice-president of communications at Emily's List, which promotes pro-choice female candidates for office, insisted that voters who support abortion rights will know to hold Republicans accountable in the midterm elections this November. 'Republicans have gotten us here in a large number of ways,' Reynolds said.  But Democratic candidates running for office this fall will have to paint a longer-term picture of how the party plans to protect abortion rights, even if they cannot prevent the court from overturning Roe. 'The Democratic party has to move away from this message about how we can fix everything right away,' said Kelly Dietrich, CEO of the National Democratic Training Committee. 'This is a lifetime struggle. Government is hard. We will need you to vote this November, next November and every November after that because the people who want to take away your rights aren't going to stop.' In the meantime, Democrats have an opportunity to turn their attention to the state and local offices that may be able to help protect abortion rights if Roe falls, Dietrich argued. 'The fight for the next 10-plus years is going to be at the state and local levels,' he said. 'It's going to be in the state legislatures. It's going to be in the city councils and at all the different local government forums we have around the country that aren't big and sexy.' Some of those efforts are already under way across the country. In Michigan, where a 1931 abortion ban is still on the books and could go back into effect if Roe is overturned, the Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has filed a lawsuit to block implementation of the law. Several county prosecutors also signed on to a statement saying they would not pursue criminal charges in connection to the 1931 law. One of those prosecutors was Democrat Karen McDonald in Oakland county, the second-largest county in Michigan. She said that, despite her despair over the likely end of Roe, she was committed to finding ways to ensure her neighbors' rights and healthcare access. 'It is a sad, tragic moment,' McDonald said. 'But I am not going to spend one minute of my energy letting that tear me away from what I think is absolutely critical right now, which is we all need to pay attention and support and fund and help elect [those candidates] who want to protect our right to choose.' Oakland county was once a Republican stronghold, but it has become increasingly Democratic in recent years. McDonald said she has heard from members of her community who previously supported Republicans and are now rethinking their politics in light of the supreme court's expected decision. 'I know a lot of women who voted for Trump and are now saying I will never, ever ever, vote for a pro-life candidate. They just didn't think it would happen,' McDonald said. 'So I think this is really turning politics on its head.' Thomas agreed that many Americans who support abortion rights seem to have been taken aback by the provisional decision to overturn Roe, even after Republicans obtained a 6-3 majority on the court. Conservatives have also been calling for the end of Roe for decades, and Trump promised to nominate anti-abortion justices to the supreme court. 'I don't think it's surprising that people had to see it to believe it, despite having heard this, particularly from Black and brown women who have been bearing the brunt of these attacks at the state level for a long time,' Thomas said. 'As an organizer, I will tell you, it's never too late to join the fight. And the time is really now.'", "2861da60ec18cbd9e1234789a25136693bc30d991e5e3a3bc46abd9f": "A young woman sits on the stairs, hair scraped back, lower lip trembling. She starts to talk about being slapped in the face, and something about the words is instantly familiar. They're taken from the actor Amber Heard's gruelling court testimony earlier this month, describing the abuse she claims to have suffered at the hands of her ex-husband, the film star Johnny Depp. Only now these words are being mockingly rehashed - and not just by this one account, belonging to a Canadian beauty business owner using the handle @sansanjovs, but across the social media platform TikTok. Exaggerated re-enactments of iconic movie scenes are popular on the site, and the same trick has been used to skewer statements from politicians. But there's something more disturbing about seeing it applied to a court case involving allegations of domestic violence. Depp is suing his ex-wife in the US for defamation over a newspaper essay she wrote in 2018. Although the Washington Post article named no names, Depp argues it clearly implicated him and that his ex-wife was 'not a victim of domestic abuse, she is a perpetrator'; she is countersuing for alleged smears against her. Wall-to-wall coverage of this case, televised in the US and live-streamed worldwide on YouTube, will have reawakened painful memories for many survivors. Yet for some on social media, the sight of Heard breaking down on the witness stand as she accused her ex-husband of sexually assaulting her with a bottle (claims he denies) seems to be just another form of entertainment, a juicy box set or episode of Love Island to be chewed over with friends. Posts debunking supposed inconsistencies in Heard's evidence have gone viral, alongside footage of a Starbucks in California that reportedly put out two tip jars - one labelled with Heard's name, the other Depp's - so customers could 'vote' for their favourite, as if on a reality TV show. While Depp's jar appears stuffed with dollar bills, Heard's looks forlornly empty. As the psychologist Dr Jessica Taylor, of the anti-victim-blaming group Victim Focus, tweeted last week: 'The fact that a man going into court to face his ex-wife giving extremely graphic testimony of sexual assault and abuse is met with gifts, fans, banners, women crying and men high-fiving him is pretty jaw-dropping no matter your views on this case.' Perhaps it's the sight of two Hollywood actors facing off on screen that has encouraged this sense of almost theatrical unreality, with Depp's team dismissing Heard's testimony as 'the performance of her life'. But few of those sharing the Twitter hashtags #Justiceforjohnny or #amberheardisaliar seem bothered that two years ago Depp lost a libel case over an article in the Sun claiming he was a 'wife-beater', with a British judge ruling the story to be 'substantially true'. Teenagers getting their news from TikTok memes or out-of-context clips on Instagram, meanwhile, may have no idea of the longer legal history. And while this excruciatingly public trial is in some ways uniquely American - British courtrooms aren't televised, sexual assault victims here have a right to anonymity, and witnesses in domestic abuse cases can testify from behind screens - British domestic violence campaigners now fear the public mockery of Heard risks deterring victims here from coming forward, for fear of being belittled and disbelieved. 'A woman recounting [what she claims is] her experience of domestic violence in itself is traumatic for many survivors. But that evidence being not just denied, but ridiculed, is deeply harmful and humiliating,' says Ruth Davison, chief executive of the domestic violence charity Refuge. 'This is a real trial. The humorousness [around] what's actually deeply offensive worries me.' Whatever the ultimate verdict in this case, the public response to it sheds a disturbing light on how misogyny persists even in a supposedly 'woke' generation. For many working in the field, that response illustrates some wearily familiar tropes: that if it was really so bad she should have left sooner (on average it takes seven attempts before a woman leaves an abusive partner, according to Refuge); that she's a 'crazy ex', seeking attention or a hefty divorce settlement; that he is so likable he couldn't possibly have done it. Yet it's far from unusual, Davison says, for perpetrators to seem 'nice'. 'These are all characteristics of abusers - that they can lovebomb you, that they're incredibly charming.' And, while well-loved celebrities may seem more likely to enjoy the benefit of the doubt, she points out that in real life victims themselves can initially find it hard to acknowledge that the man they love is abusive, telling themselves his behaviour was simply out of character. Perhaps the most pervasive trope, however, is that there is such a thing as a 'model' victim against whom others can - and should - be judged. Heard has been criticised for crying too much, or not crying enough; one popular online theory is that her occasional glances in Depp's direction and his reluctance to make eye contact show he's more frightened of her than the other way round. London's victims commissioner, Claire Waxman, is a regular observer of family courts. She frequently meets abuse survivors and has been the victim of stalking in the past. There is, she says firmly, no such thing as a typical way to behave on the witness stand. 'Some victims are completely devoid of any emotion, and that doesn't mean it didn't happen. They are disconnected - it's quite a normal response to trauma. Whereas others can't even put a sentence together because they're crying so much, and that's normal, too.' But when Waxman tweeted that she had found aspects of the public response to the case 'nothing short of shocking', she was bombarded with comments accusing her of being 'trash', or 'schizophrenic like her'. (A psychologist hired by Depp's team gave evidence that she had diagnosed Heard as suffering from a borderline personality disorder and so-called histrionic personality disorder, only for the psychologist hired by Heard's team to testify that she had diagnosed instead post-traumatic stress disorder triggered by abuse). The suggestion that survivors are mentally unstable is also familiar, says Waxman, with even problems triggered by the abuse itself sometimes twisted and weaponised against women in court. 'It's quite common for women who allege abuse in the family courts to be told they've got personality disorders, they're mentally unwell, they're unbalanced. It's misunderstanding the impact of abuse, the response to it and the trauma that they may have.' The minimising and mockery of Heard's allegations online are already, Waxman thinks, making women hesitate over reporting similar stories. 'It feels like we're undoing years of work. I've been contacted by victims who are deeply distressed by the coverage, and professionals supporting victims who are really questioning 'Am I worthy of being believed? Would I want to disclose and get that response that [we're] seeing?'' 'I've had pushback from some people saying: 'Well, if she made a false allegation then we have to call it out',' says Waxman, 'but it's fuelling the misconception that false allegations of abuse and sexual abuse are rife. They're not.' Home Office research suggests only around 3% to 6% of rape allegations are false, she says; in such cases the truth should be established by police and courts in possession of all the evidence, not amateur trial by social media. While Waxman praises the government's recent 'Enough' campaign, encouraging Britons to challenge coercive and abusive behaviour where they see it in public, she worries about teenagers' broader attitudes being shaped by the virulent attacks on Heard by Depp supporters. Men's rights activists have also been vocal in support of the Pirates of the Caribbean star, and see this case as opening wider conversations about divorce or illuminating the plight of battered men. (The 2018 ONS Crime Survey for England and Wales found 4.3% of men experienced domestic abuse in the previous year, compared with 7.5% of women, although men were less likely to report it to police; according to the separate Scottish Crime and Justice Survey, most perpetrators of domestic violence against men were female.) More startling, however, is that many of the Heard-baiters on social media or fans mobbing Depp outside court are young women closer to Heard's age of 36. To Davison, that's not so surprising. 'We live in a misogynistic world, and therefore what we accept is normal, what we think is normal, is misogynistic, whether we're male or female.' Arguably, the pro-Depp hashtag #abusehasnogender, shared online by both men and women, may also have particular resonance for younger people used to rejecting crude gender stereotypes. Certainly one thing that makes this case particularly incendiary is that Heard herself was arrested in 2009 on suspicion of assaulting her then girlfriend, Tasya van Ree. All charges were dropped and van Ree has subsequently insisted Heard was 'wrongfully' accused, by police who 'misinterpreted and over-sensationalised the incident'. But a recording played in court of Heard apparently admitting to hitting Depp has also prompted widespread debates about whether so-called mutual abuse - where both partners are violent towards each other - genuinely exists, or whether it's an accusation largely levelled by perpetrators to muddy the waters. Without passing judgment on what may or may not have happened in this particular marriage, Davison says domestic abuse classically involves an imbalance of power, allowing one partner to control the other. 'We don't subscribe as Refuge to the idea that a relationship is abusive - that starts to muddle things. A perpetrator can be abusive, and it is always a perpetrator's choice to abuse. I think once you start to call a relationship abusive or toxic, it starts to apportion blame to the victim.' She adds: 'What's also commonly known in domestic abuse is the concept of DARVO - the perpetrator Denying, then Attacking, then Reversing the Victim-Offender role.' The key lesson Davison draws from the furore surrounding the trial, however, is social media's growing role in amplifying abuse and manipulation. It's rare now for reports of domestic violence not to include attempts to threaten, humiliate or pursue victims online, says Davison, and persuading tech platforms to take down more subtle forms of harassment isn't always easy. Posting a picture of a woman standing outside her own house, for example, might seem harmless - but not if the message is that an abuser knows where she now lives. Davison recalls the story of a woman who went on one date with a man she met via a dating app, in a public place well away from home. 'She didn't want to see them again. But they managed to identify where she lived by cyberstalking effectively, [using] information that was in the public domain, and started posting photos on social media of her front door. You can't say how terrifying that must be, and yet that is an everyday experience that we're finding.' Refuge now has a specialist tech team that can help survivors get abusive material taken down, working closely with the major platforms. But Davison is hoping an online safety bill being taken through parliament by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, which seeks to regulate behaviour deemed 'legal but harmful', could strengthen such protection. And in the meantime, what would she like abused women following the case to know? 'If you're feeling distressed by this, if it's making you realise your own situation is abusive, if you're feeling retraumatised - Refuge does believe you. We are here for you.' It may be some time, sadly, before the rest of society can say the same.", "9e31b459e6eef9d1806c620e7c1a3ad66a0f9a1ec094d7247a5d90e4": "", "070430757806ab291a232b099a252c49f91a63de9b5c3bca00ec2f17": "For more than two years, the people of Japan and South Korea have been united by their embrace of little white rectangles. While the US and countries in Europe debated the efficacy of masks at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, Japanese and South Koreans quickly covered up, uncomplainingly and with few exceptions. Explanations for the wildly contrasting coronavirus death tolls in developed countries are many and varied, but in north-east Asia - more than anywhere else - mask-wearing has been at the forefront of the public health response to the virus. But with cases stabilising in Japan and South Korea, are people now willing to live without their masks? This month, South Korea, which has recorded 23,606 Covid-19 deaths in its population of 52 million, ended a requirement for masks to be worn outdoors - except for gatherings of 50 or more people - but kept the mandate for indoors and public transport. Choi Il-woo, a Seoul office worker, said he had enjoyed removing his mask last week. 'With summer approaching, it feels so nice to finally be able to take off my mask when I go for a walk,' he said. 'But there are still a lot of people wearing masks on the streets, so I think we still have to be careful.' Government officials cited a downward trend in daily cases of Covid-19 after its most recent wave, driven by the Omicron variant, peaked in mid-March. In Japan, where just over 30,000 people have died from the virus, the imminent arrival of a long, humid summer and the increased risk of heatstroke prompted some experts and officials to call for an end to advice to wear face coverings outdoors. 'We recommend that people take off their masks outside as long as sufficient distance is maintained, especially when temperatures and humidity are high,' said Hirokazu Matsuno, the chief cabinet secretary. Despite the wide acceptance of face coverings in Japan, some have voiced frustration that, more than two years into the pandemic, there are few signs of a return to a largely maskless existence, even as restrictions are eased or abandoned in other countries. Akino Yoshihara, an interpreter living in Kyoto, said she would feel 'much more comfortable' without a mask but would continue to wear hers to prevent the spread of the virus. 'Even if the government encourages us to remove our masks, I'm sure many people would still wear them,' she said. Toshio Nakagawa, president of the Japan Medical Association, suggested face coverings could remain the norm for the foreseeable future. 'I believe that the day people can stop wearing masks will never come in Japan so long as the country continues seeing coronavirus cases,' he said. Japan's government recommends face coverings at schools and workplaces and in other settings with large numbers of people, and encourages them to avoid the 'three Cs' - close-contact settings, closed spaces and crowded places. The country has depended on high levels of public acceptance for mask-wearing and other anti-virus measures, since its government does not have the legal power to impose lockdowns or make face coverings mandatory. In a country where mask-wearing is common during the flu and hay fever seasons, few complained about continuing the habit throughout the pandemic. And with summer approaching, there are few signs that people are ready to abandon their masks, however uncomfortable they may be at the hottest time of the year. According to a survey by Nippon Information, more than 50% of respondents wanted to continue using masks, with 22% saying they would wear theirs 'all the time'. Only 13.5% said they wanted to cast them off altogether. Misae Minami only removes hers during her morning runs, when there are few people around. 'I always keep my mask on outdoors if there are people within 2 metres of me,' said Minami, a teacher in Osaka, adding that she had no plans to change her behaviour. 'We still feel a lot of pressure to wear masks, and as a teacher I always have to tell my students to keep theirs on. I have to be a role model.' Kim Ki-kyung, an office worker in Seoul, said he barely noticed his mask, given that it had been an essential accoutrement for so long. 'Also, I don't need to think about grooming or my facial expressions, and it helps protect against pollution such as fine dust. And you have to wear one when you go indoors, so it's annoying to take it on and off.' While Japan has a tiny anti-mask movement, peer pressure to stay covered up could be overwhelming, said Yuki Nakagome, a Tokyo-based writer who has started lowering his mask on warm days when no one else is around. 'There is a certain pressure to keep wearing masks that may be peculiar to Japanese society, and I don't see that pressure moving in the opposite direction,' he said. 'No one wants to be the first person to remove their mask.'

The court has previously heard that Vardy and her agent, Caroline Watt, had lengthy WhatsApp exchanges about Rooney's personal life, in which Rooney was allegedly branded a 'nasty bitch' and a 'cunt'. Rooney told the high court she spent months posting fake Instagram stories and restricting their audience to just Vardy's account, in an effort to work out who was passing stories about her private life to the tabloid newspaper. She said did not inform anyone - including her husband, Wayne - that she was conducting a months-long sting operation into who was leaking stories from a private Instagram account to the Sun. Rooney said she stayed quiet because she did not want to suggest Vardy was leaking stories to the paper without being certain: 'I don't like to do something if I'm not 100% sure myself. I wouldn't mention it to someone with the smallest little bit of doubt.' Rooney said Vardy had told a 'lot of lies' during the legal proceedings and insisted she only made the public accusation that Vardy was the leaker as a last resort to try to finally stop stories about her private life appearing in the newspaper. Vardy denies being responsible for the leaks and is suing Rooney for libel. Rooney concluded that Vardy's account was responsible after another story apparently sourced to her private Instagram appeared in the Sun in October 2019. She then wrote her post accusing Vardy in longhand with a pen and notepad, before sending it to her brother to format for uploading to the internet. Vardy's legal team have repeatedly criticised Rooney's failure to follow standard journalistic practice, such as requesting a comment from Vardy before publishing her accusation. Rooney said she decided not to go to Vardy before posting the accusation in public, saying: 'I know it sounds tough - but at the time I didn't think she would tell the truth even if I confronted her.' She also feared Vardy would try to brief friendly journalists if she had advance warning. Rooney said her suspicions were raised further when she briefly blocked Vardy from the private Instagram account in early 2019 and Vardy messaged to complain about the decision. At one point the court heard an extensive discussion of whether it was correct that photographs uploaded directly to Instagram stories are automatically saved as a copy on an iPhone's camera roll. Rooney told the court she found the entire 'Wagatha Christie' label baffling and regularly monitored her own press coverage: 'I do Google News and put my name in and read any relevant articles that come up.' She said the WhatsApp messages involving Vardy and her agent that had been disclosed to the court were: 'just evil and uncalled for, speaking about something you don't know'. 'There's no need for them to be stalking and monitoring me,' she said. Rooney said anyone could have carried out her sting operation and it did not take much technical knowhow: 'It wasn't hard. Anyone could do it. It worked for me and I found out which account was doing it at the end of it.' The court also heard from other witnesses for Rooney's defence. A former Football Association official, Harpreet Robertson, said that during an England match at the Euro 2016 football tournament, Vardy sat in different seats to her allocated places - potentially to ensure she was 'right in the eye line of anyone looking at, or photographing, Coleen'. Robertson said: 'The following morning, the tabloid papers were full of photographs of her sat directly behind Coleen. This was precisely the kind of media attention that the FA, and I, had tried to avoid.' Rachel Monk, who helped Rooney with PR on an ad-hoc basis, also told the court she had been baffled when she was approached by the Sun journalist Ellie Henman with a story that the footballer's wife was visiting a gender selection clinic. Rooney alleges this fake story was leaked to the Sun from her private Instagram account by Vardy. Acting on her client's orders, Monk - who was not aware of the sting operation - phoned back Henman and said there would be no comment on the story but it sounded 'bonkers'. Monk told the court this did not stop the tabloid: 'Ellie replied and told me that the Sun would be running with the gender selection story because 'they had a screenshot', which confirmed their source.' The trial continues, with Wayne Rooney due to be called as a witness on Tuesday, along with a number of technical experts who are expected to discuss the data retrieval issues that have plagued the case.", "e5790263cf560bbce640f54b69696b9b4b7307ac9177709ffbdc8dd4": "Ukraine could receive loans, grants and possibly the proceeds of seized Russian oligarch property to help pay the multibillion-euro cost of rebuilding the country after the ruinous war launched by the Kremlin, according to a leaked EU reconstruction plan. In the plan drafted in Brussels, the European Commission states that the Ukrainian government will have to take out loans to pay for rebuilding its war-ravaged country. Non-repayable grants from EU member states would provide another tranche of the funds needed to rebuild destroyed homes, schools, roads, railways, airports and bridges. The EU also proposes assessing the feasibility of using assets seized from sanctioned Russians and Belarusians after a proposal from the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, earlier this month. 'I am absolutely convinced that this is extremely important not only to freeze assets, but also to make possible to confiscate it, to make it available for the rebuilding of the country,' he told Ukraine's Interfax news agency. Lawmakers in the UK and the US have also proposed seizing Russian property to aid Ukraine's reconstruction and ease the plight of the country's refugees. Brussels officials have also called for the EU to borrow as a bloc on international capital markets to finance loans for Kyiv, according to the leaked report. If agreed, it would be only the second time in its history that the EU has borrowed as a whole rather than as individual member states, after funding the landmark EUR750bn (PS635bn) Covid recovery plan in 2020. The idea is floated in a Ukraine relief and reconstruction plan seen by the Guardian that the commission is expected to publish on Wednesday. Figures have been left blank in the document, pending further discussions in Brussels. The paper notes, however, that the financial needs 'are expected to be substantial' and that reconstruction would take more than a decade. It also estimates that damage to physical infrastructure alone may run to more than EUR100bn. To pay the bill, the commission proposes a mix of grants and cheap loans in which EU member states and non-EU countries could make contributions via the bloc's reconstruction programme.  Ukraine will need 'significant short-term financial relief' to sustain basic services, provide humanitarian aid and fix essential infrastructure, the EU document states. To meet these urgent needs, the commission proposes loans at low interest rates with long-term repayment deadlines. The US president, Joe Biden, proposed a $33bn (PS27bn) aid programme for Ukraine last month, which includes more than $20bn in military spending. The EU has provided EUR4.1bn in emergency loans and humanitarian aid since the start of Russia's invasion and agreed to fund weapons and other non-lethal military assistance worth EUR1.5bn. This does not include the money that individual EU member states have provided. The EU's reconstruction plan would be jointly led by Brussels and Kyiv, according to the document. Although it does not explicitly mention Ukraine's hopes of joining the EU, the plan would be intended to bring the aspirant member in line with EU standards, including on the rule of law, anti-corruption, energy and the climate.", "48975dcdc80e9ffa61c93e86aeb8ea75f841b9086abd72f704afc2a9": "", "c1a29488792df67da8e0fa4f72ef6748e426630195cb315e31f174ee": "Workers in America's fast-food and retail sectors who worked on the frontlines through the dangers of the Covid-19 pandemic are continuing a trend of strikes and protests over low wages, safety concerns and sexual harassment issues on the job. The Covid-19 pandemic has incited a resurgence of interest and support for the US labor movement and for low-wage workers who bore the brunt of Covid-19 risks. The unrest also comes as corporations have often reported record profits and showered executives with pay increases, stock buybacks and bonuses, while workers received minimal pay increases. Workers at billion-dollar corporations from Dollar General to McDonald's still make on average less than $15 an hour while often being forced to work in unsafe, grueling conditions. On 2 May, Dollar General workers at a store in Marion, North Carolina, walked off the job over low wages. Ashley Sierra has worked at Dollar General for two years and makes just $11 an hour, while only receiving part-time hours. A mother of three, she relies on family members to barely make ends meet. 'My weekly paycheck is no more than $200, $260 at the max. I have three children, I cannot survive on $260 a week, it's just not working. It needs to get upped to at least $15 an hour, the bottom is $15, because we work so hard for so little,' said Sierra. Dollar General reported a profit of $3.2bn and their CEO was paid over $16.4m in 2021, 986 times the median pay of the company's workers. Sierra said the store was often understaffed and overstocked with items that block aisles, and that she feared for her safety over potential robberies and theft when she and just one other co-worker are working the entire store. Dollar General did not comment on the company's low wages. In regards to the walkout, a spokesperson said in an email: 'We understand a small number of employees chose to express their personal opinions about the company earlier this week by walking off the job. We respect our employees' right to engage in protected activities and as is our practice, we plan to listen, and are listening, to their feedback.' Workers at a McDonald's in Los Angeles began a strike on Monday, 2 May, in response to plumbing issues at the restaurant that recently worsened, emitting odors that have made workers sick. 'It gives me headaches, stomachaches and nausea, and it's been happening to my co-workers also,' said Jasmina Alfaro, one of the striking workers at the McDonald's location. 'It has become a horrible smell all over the kitchen and store and we've noticed there's water also leaking with disgusting debris.' She explained for the past year a foul odor had been emanating from pipes near the drive thru window, but severely worsened over the past week throughout the entire restaurant. Despite the odor, workers were still expected to conduct business as usual. Alfaro said she had missed days of work due to getting sick from the odor and had not been compensated for that time missed from work. Alfaro said the strike will continue until the problem is fixed, and the issue is an example of why fast-food workers in California need local proposed law AB 257 to pass, which would establish a statewide fast-food council with worker representation to set wage and other industry standards, including safety protections. 'This is the only way we're going to have a voice that represents us, so we can be listened to and not be ignored. We shouldn't have to risk our health to make a living,' Alfaro said. A spokesperson for McDonald's did not comment on the strike but claimed in an email: 'This restaurant underwent a recent health inspection and was found to be in good standing. We have already begun repairing a plumbing issue that recently arose at the restaurant and expect it to be resolved shortly.' At a Jack in the Box location in Sacramento, California, workers went on strike for three days at the end of April 2022 over faulty equipment and safety concerns, and short staffing. Workers at a Wendy's in Weaverville, North Carolina, went on strike on 23 April through 1 May over sexual harassment and abuse from the restaurant's general manager toward employees that upper management had not addressed. Charity Bradley, a Wendy's manager at the restaurant, claimed she was retaliated against for reporting complaints about the general management to corporate, as she was taken off the schedule and locked out of the crew app used to communicate with co-workers. Bradley was reinstated by the end of the strike and returned to work on 2 May. Bradley said the strike began the very next day after she was removed from the schedule and the app. 'When we reported it to upper management, they pretty much just blew it off, they really didn't do anything. We called the corporate hotline several times and never received any response,' said Bradley. She added: 'Wendy's could be a good place to work. They need to get it together and start taking care of their people and start doing what's right, not sweeping it under the rug.' The CEO of Tar Heel Capital Corp, which operates several Wendy's franchises in North Carolina, said in a statement in regards to the strike: 'We are aware of the allegations being made and are taking this very seriously, following our policy of conducting a thorough investigation into the matter. As an organization, we strive to create a safe and comfortable work environment free from harassment. If, at the conclusion of our investigation, we find that any of the accusations are true, we will take swift disciplinary action.'", "fd0e6ee4f93c629dbd2a4fa63bf1932f30ebff9dffa6a7e8ef0ae73a": "The suspected perpetrator of the deadly shooting in Buffalo, New York, on Saturday may have been the latest mass killer to be motivated by a growing fixation of rightwingers - environmental degradation and the impact of overpopulation. The attack, that left 10 people shot dead and three wounded, has been described as a 'hate crime and a case of racially-motivated violent extremism' by the FBI. The 18-year-old suspect allegedly began firing his weapon in the car park of the Tops supermarket in Buffalo, before entering the store and continuing his murderous rampage inside, streaming the attack live online. Authorities believe the killer chose the supermarket due to the surrounding area's sizable Black community, with an 180-page manifesto believed to have been written and posted online by the suspect referencing his desire to 'kill as many Blacks as possible' and his belief in the 'great replacement theory', which holds that white people are at risk of losing their status and traditional culture because of immigrants. The manifesto, also, however, includes theories on the environment that are similar to screeds espoused by other recent mass murderers. The Buffalo suspect calls himself an 'eco-fascist' and blames migration for harm to the environment in the document posted online. 'For too long we have allowed the left to co-opt the environmentalist movement to serve their own needs,' the Buffalo manifesto states. 'The left has controlled all discussion regarding environmental preservation whilst simultaneously presiding over the continued destruction of the natural environment itself through mass immigration and uncontrolled urbanization, whilst offering no true solution to either issue.' This invocation of eco-fascism, or green racism, echoes that of a white nationalist who killed 51 people in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. 'The invaders are the ones over-populating the world,' the Christchurch murderer wrote in his own manifesto. 'Kill the invaders, kill the overpopulation and by doing so save the environment.' Just a few months after the New Zealand attack, a gunman killed 23 people in El Paso, Texas, leaving behind a note that also blamed overpopulation for causing pollution. 'If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can become more sustainable,' he wrote. Studies have repeatedly shown that migration itself does not cause an increase in carbon emissions or other pollution - indeed, American-born people are far larger consumers of resources than new immigrants - and that voracious consumption, rather than population per se, is the primary driver of the climate and ecological crises that currently grip the world. However, the latest shooting shows that a dangerously warped vision of environmentalism is now becoming an increasingly common animating force for rightwing extremists, according to Betsy Hartmann, an expert in the environment and migration at Hampshire College. 'It's extremely frightening,' she said. 'Eco-fascism has always been a part of white supremacy, even going back to Hitler, but it would seem to me in white supremacist circles it's becoming a more accepted part of the ideology. It's not an outlier anymore.' Hartmann said the rise of Donald Trump and Republicans' embrace of anti-immigrant rhetoric is fueling the spread of so-called eco-fascism, as well as growing alarm, particularly among younger people, over the climate emergency. 'For younger people, the more apocalyptic images of climate change can fit into the white supremacist view of apocalypse, too,' she said. 'It's scary how much this person is taking from the Christchurch and El Paso killings, how he's inspired by those things. It shows how powerful this has become, given how explicit it is now.' A recasting of environmental concern in a racist context has been embraced by several prominent figures in the US, such as the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has called immigrants 'unclean' and a threat to America's environment, and the Republican attorney-general of Arizona, who has called for a border wall to be erected to avoid migrants not just arriving in the US via Mexico but allegedly worsening climate change. Meanwhile, several rightwing political parties in Europe have resorted to what academics call 'ecobordering', where restrictions on immigration are touted as vital to protect the nativist stewardship of nature and where the ills of environmental destruction are laid upon those from developing countries, ignoring the far larger consumptive habits of wealthy nations and that impact on other countries, creating climate refugees. In an analysis of 22 far-right parties in Europe, researchers found this thinking was rife and 'portrays effects as causes and further normalizes racist border practices and colonial amnesia within Europe'.

The centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of the incumbent state premier, Hendrik Wust, emerged as the strongest party on the night in North Rhine-Westphalia, with 35.7% of the vote, while the Social Democratic party (SPD) came second with its worst postwar result in the former stronghold state in the industrial west. With the liberal Free Democratic party (FDP) halving its vote and the Green party gaining 11.8 percentage points to emerge as kingmaker for the influential state's next coalition government, a power-sharing agreement between the conservative and ecological parties is the most likely outcome. Electoral trends in North Rhine-Westphalia mirrored those the previous weekend in Germany's northernmost state, Schleswig-Holstein, where the CDU and Greens also managed to score significant gains and are expected to continue governing in a three-way coalition with the FDP. Here too, the SPD achieved its worst result of the postwar era, with only 16% of the vote. In a marked contrast to the recent French election showing the far right and far left increasing in strength, both German state polls accentuated an erosion of support for the far-right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) and the leftwing Die Linke. The AfD saw losses of two percentage points in North Rhine-Westphalia and dropped below the 5% electoral threshold in Schleswig-Holstein, while the left party will be represented in neither state parliaments. Accusations of appeasing Putin may have been a contributory factor: the parliamentary groups of the AfD and Die Linke were the only ones to vote against sending heavy weapons to Ukraine in the Bundestag at the end of April. The struggles of the two parties, whose positions are diametrically opposed on most issues other than Russia, predates the war in Ukraine, however. The AfD, which surged on to Germany's political scene by promising a populist backlash after the eurozone crisis and an influx of Syrian refugees in 2015, has now suffered losses in the last eight consecutive state votes, including those in eastern parts of Germany such as Berlin, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Saxony-Anhalt. Die Linke, meanwhile, has looked rudderless after scraping into the federal parliament last September only thanks to a special provision for parties with at least three direct mandates. Internally divided between the noisily populist messaging of the prominent Sahra Wagenknecht and a more pragmatic but also less prolific faction, it has lost votes in seven elections in a row. The double blow for the Social Democrats, meanwhile, comes just over six months after Scholz and his party stormed to a triumphant photo finish at national elections, in which the taciturn northerner managed to successfully offer himself up as a leader in the calm, pragmatic mould of the outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel. Russia's war in Ukraine, however, has turned some of Scholz's selling points into negatives, as commentators accuse him of failing to adequately explain his position on weapons exports or energy embargoes. 'Scholz is trapped in the role of the crisis chancellor,' wrote the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Monday. 'For weeks the war in Ukraine has almost completely overshadowed all other issues.' 'Scholz's hesitant course on delivering heavy weapons to Ukraine is being interpreted by a section of society as weak leadership, while others consider it prudent.' As Scholz has looked hamstrung by an internal SPD debate on the failures of its historical policy of economic rapprochement with Russia, the Greens of the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and the economic minister, Robert Habeck, who have managed to communicate their positions more convincingly. 'The way Habeck and Baerbock are ushering the country through these times of war appears to convince people,' wrote Der Spiegel, 'with clear words, emotion and the odd admission that they too struggle with actions demanded of them'. In Germany's federalised political system, not every vote at state level can be interpreted as a verdict on the conduct of the national government. A month into the Ukraine war, the SPD also managed to score an absolute majority in the small state of Saarland, a rarity in contemporary Germany.", "57bb688834030defc534b2e9bc7461979ad765598905473a21ca71fe": "", "01ae43244003a47e814e1873ce9fe7cdd784b43bd38b508e771e6140": "The governor of Ukraine's Kharkiv region has said that Ukrainian troops defending Kharkiv have reached the state border with Russia. Reuters said it could not independently verify the comments made by Kharkiv region governor Oleh Sinegubov on the Telegram messaging service. It was not immediately clear how many troops had reached the Russian border and where. Kharkiv region governor Oleh Sinegubov wrote on the Telegram messaging app that troops of the 227th Battalion had restored a sign on the state border. 'We thank everyone who, risking their lives, liberates Ukraine from Russian invaders,' Sinegubov said. If confirmed, it would suggest a Ukrainian counter-offensive is having increasing success in pushing back Russian forces in the northeast after Western military agencies said Moscow's offensive in the Donbas region had stalled. Ukraine has been retaking territory in its north-east, driving Russian forces away from Kharkiv, the second-largest Ukrainian city. Ukraine's defence ministry said in a Facebook post that the 227th Battalion of the 127th Brigade of Ukraine's armed forces had reached the border with Russia, adding: 'Together to victory!' EU foreign ministers sought to publicly pressure Hungary to lift its veto on a proposed oil embargo on Russia, with Lithuania saying the bloc was being 'held hostage by one member state'.Reuters reports: Russia has said its forces shot down three Ukrainian fighter jets, one near Snake Island in the Black Sea and the others in the Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions, while its missiles continued to pound targets in the east of the country.Reuters reports: A tweet in Ukrainian from Hromadske Radio, meaning public radio in Ukrainian, quotes the head of the Sumy region, Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, as saying: The Kastus Kalinouski Battalion, comprising Belarusian volunteers fighting for Ukraine, has suffered its third loss, according to a tweet from Nexta, a Belarussian news channel. Next quotes a tweet from the battalion, which said: A missile strike by Russian strategic aircraft in the Odesa region has damaged the region's tourist infrastructure and injured two adults and a child, Interfax news agency in Ukraine reports.The report cites Odesa city council's Telegram channel as its source. The message reads:  Many forgotten women in Ukraine are living alone in dire conditions or are unable to care for themselves, and are among those least able to escape, writes Angelina Kariakina in Kyiv and Luba Kassova. The Institute for the Study of War in the US has some analysis on Russia's movements in Ukraine. Forces have probably abandoned the objective to encircle Ukrainian units in Donetsk and Izium, and are shifting focus to completing the seizure of Luhansk province, the institute writes. The report adds: The EU will impose a sixth sanctions package on Russia, but the bloc will need more time to find agreement. Luxembourg's foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, told reporters on Monday ahead of a meeting with his counterparts in Brussels. Meanwhile, Austria's foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, said: Sweden is sending diplomats to Turkey to try to overcome Ankara's objections to its plan to join Nato, defence minister Peter Hultqvist has said.Turkey has surprised its Nato allies by saying it would not view applications by Finland and Sweden positively, with President Tayyip Erdogan saying: 'Scandinavian countries are guesthouses for terrorist organisations.' Defence minister Peter Hultqvist told public service broadcaster SVT: Turkey said it wanted the Nordic countries to halt support for Kurdish militant groups present on their territory, and lift bans on sales of some weapons to Turkey.Nato and the US said they were confident Turkey would not hold up membership of Finland and Sweden.Any decision on Nato enlargement requires approval by all 30 members of the alliance and their parliaments, but diplomats said Erdogan would be under pressure to yield as Finland and Sweden would greatly strengthen Nato in the Baltic Sea. Sweden's parliament will hold a debate on its membership application on Monday, a formality as there is already a broad majority in favour. The government will take the formal decision to apply later in the day, Hultqvist said. Turkey must maintain a delicate diplomatic balance following Russia's invasion of Ukraine so that it remains able to help facilitate an eventual negotiated end to the war, President Tayyip Erdogan's spokesperson said in an interview. Ibrahim Kalin, who is also Erdogan's chief foreign policy adviser, said that while Ankara has criticised Moscow's invasion and actions on the battlefield it would do no good to take a more punitive stance against Russia. Nato member Turkey, a Black Sea neighbour of both Russia and Ukraine, has good ties with both and has opposed western sanctions on Moscow. It has seen tens of thousands of Russians - and some oligarchs' sanctioned yachts - arrive since war began.Yet it has also supplied Kyiv with armed drones and blocked some Russian naval passage to the Black Sea, and stands alone as having hosted talks between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers and separately between their teams.'We have opposed this war from the beginning' but also maintained contact with Moscow, Kalin said at the weekend.Kalin told Reuters: There are some lines from Russia's foreign ministry coming out on Sweden and Finland's decision to join Nato, which is one of today's big stories.  The deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabko, said the decision was a mistake with far-reaching consequences, which will radically change the global situation.The Guardian's full report on the Nordic nations' decision, which represents a radical shift in foreign policy, is here:", "e148da8786db804f112e7018d79b6a6447a3ab3ea91a1e88f112809f": "Russia has attacked positions in eastern Ukraine as it tries to encircle Ukrainian forces in the Donbas and fend off a counteroffensive around the city of Izium. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Russia's offensive in Donbas had stalled and Ukraine could win the war, an outcome few military analysts predicted at the outset of the conflict.  'Russia's war in Ukraine is not going as Moscow had planned,' Stoltenberg said. Finland on Sunday confirmed it would apply to join Nato, while Sweden's ruling Social Democrats backed Nato membership, paving the way for an application and abandoning decades of neutrality. Nato and the US said they were confident both countries would be accepted, and that reservations from Turkey could be overcome - it wants them to halt support for Kurdish militant groups present on their territory. British military intelligence said Russia had lost about a third of the ground combat force deployed in February, and its Donbas offensive had fallen 'significantly behind schedule'. As well as losing large numbers of men and much military equipment, Russia has been hit by economic sanctions, while western states have provided Ukraine with military aid. Ukraine has deployed many of its new US M-777 howitzers at the frontlines, and Washington has delivered all but one of the 90 artillery pieces it was due to send, according to the US embassy in Kyiv. Washington lawmakers are set to press ahead this week with efforts to send more aid. Ukraine has scored a series of successes since Russia invaded on 24 February, reversing an advance on the capital, Kyiv, and in the last few days driving Russian forces out of Kharkiv in the east. Since mid-April, Russian forces have focused on trying to capture two eastern provinces known as the Donbas. Moscow recognised the independence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic in the Donbas days before it launched its invasion of Ukraine. The most intense fighting appeared to be around the eastern Russian-held city of Izium, where Russia said it had struck Ukrainian positions with missiles. Ukraine's military said its troops had repelled 17 attacks on Sunday and destroyed 11 pieces of Russian equipment. The command of Ukraine's air force said Ukrainian forces downed two helicopters, two cruise missiles and seven drones. Russia continued to target civilian areas along the entire frontline in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, firing at 23 villages and towns, the Ukrainian military added. Reuters was not able to independently confirm the reports. Russia denies targeting civilians. If Ukraine can sustain pressure on Izium and Russian supply lines, it will be harder for Moscow to encircle Ukrainian troops in the Donbas. Ukraine's military also acknowledged setbacks, saying Russian forces 'continue to advance' in several areas in the Donbas region. In western Ukraine near Poland, missiles destroyed military infrastructure and were fired at the Lviv region from the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials said. Another 10 civilians were wounded in the southern region of Mykolaiv, the regional council said, without providing details. There was also no let-up on Sunday in Russia's bombardment of the Azovstal steelworks in the southern port of Mariupol, where a few hundred Ukrainian fighters are holding out weeks after the city fell into Russian hands, the Ukrainian military said. Brightly burning munitions were shown cascading down on the steelworks in a video posted by a pro-Russian separatist commander. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has spoken of 'very difficult and delicate negotiations' to save Ukrainians in Mariupol and Azovstal. In the port city, some residents ate and talked outside their burnt-out apartment building, which was shelled and caught fire in early April. 'I was in the kitchen when the smoke appeared,' one resident named Natalya said. 'I started carrying out my belongings, saving what I could.' She said three neighbours had died in the fighting. 'We could not bury them because of the shelling. Each day we've been putting a person into a grave, but we could not cover it up with soil because of the shelling.' Ukrainian troops received a morale boost from the country's win in the Eurovision song contest on the weekend, with some saying it was a sign of battlefield victories to come. 'We have shown that we can not only fight, but we can also sing very nice,' said Vitaliy, a soldier bunkered down north of Kyiv.

The development, which was met with ridicule by Russians with long memories, follows Renault's decision to join the wave of western companies such as McDonald's and Siemens leaving the Russian market as the war in Ukraine nears its fourth month. Renault has ceded its 68% stake in Russia's biggest carmaker, AvtoVAZ, with an option to buy it back within six years. According to media reports, the company's Russian assets were sold for one rouble, meaning the city of Moscow has effectively taken control of the factory free. Renault's CEO, Luca de Meo, said in statement that the company was protecting its future business in Russia. 'Today we have taken a difficult but necessary decision, and we are making a responsible choice towards our 45,000 employees in Russia while preserving the group's performance and our ability to return to the country in the future.' Hawkish commentators such as the head of Russia Today, Margarita Simonyan, have said foreign companies that leave the Russian market should have their local assets seized. Moscow's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, appeared to defend Renault's decision and said the city would take over the factory to prevent unemployment. 'The foreign owner decided to close the Moscow Renault plant,' said Sobyanin. 'This is its right, but we cannot allow thousands of workers to be left without work. Therefore, I decided to take the plant under control of the city and resume the production of passenger cars under the historical Moskvitch brand. We will try to keep most of the team working directly at the plant and its associates.' For Russians who have joked about the country's return to Soviet isolation, the revival of the Moskvitch was the perfect punchline. 'Russia has invented a time machine,' wrote one. 'It can move the whole country through time, but only back into the Soviet Union.' The satirical website Panorama predicted the revival of the Moskvitch a month ago when it wrote a fake headline that the Renault factory had 'assembled its first Moskvitch in 20 years'. 'Panorama does not make predictions, we report exclusively on real news from the future,' it wrote on Monday after the deal was announced. McDonald's announced on Monday that it would be leaving the Russian market and selling its 850 locations to a local buyer. 'The humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, and the precipitating unpredictable operating environment, have led McDonald's to conclude that continued ownership of the business in Russia is no longer tenable,' the company said. The opening of the first McDonald's on Moscow's Pushkinskaya Square in 1990 was a major event. More than 30,000 Soviet citizens formed a queue kilometres long to sample the burgers, fries and soft drinks. Russian state news agencies said the stores would reopen by mid-June. 'McDonald's will return to Russia in June under a new brand,' Tass cited a source as saying. 'The restaurant chain and menu will be preserved, as will the jobs. More than 90% of suppliers are Russian, cooperation with them will continue. In fact, only the name will go.'", "d541ed5b360a4550609d7015d37802841908022d16c4df64c27e7c76": "McDonald's has initiated a process to sell its business in Russia after 30 years of operating its restaurants in the country, after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. In March, McDonald's closed all its restaurants in Russia including its site in Pushkin Square in the capital, which was the first in the country. As part of the exit, the company expects to record a non-cash charge of about $1.2bn (PS980m) to $1.4bn. 'The humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, and the precipitating unpredictable operating environment, have led McDonald's to conclude that continued ownership of the business in Russia is no longer tenable,' McDonald's said.

In his first address to the country since he was appointed as interim prime minister on Thursday, after Mahinda Rajapaksa stepped down from the role amid Sri Lanka's worst economic crash since independence, Wickremesinghe was blunt as he described the conditions of the country's finances as 'extremely precarious'. 'In November 2019, our foreign exchange reserves were at $7.5bn. However, today, it is a challenge for the Treasury to find $1m,' he said. Wickremesinghe said the country had 'run out of petrol ... At the moment, we only have petrol stocks for a single day.' He warned that the power outages, which have already lasted up to eight hours a day, were likely to worsen in the next two months. While there are ships carrying fuel in the harbour of the capital city, Colombo, the prime minister admitted that the government could not currently afford to pay for them, even as people queued in desperation for hours outside petrol stations. 'We must prepare ourselves to make some sacrifices and face the challenges of this period' said Wickremesinghe. His speech was the most upfront given by a ruling figure about the financial disaster gripping Sri Lanka, which has spiralled from an economic crisis into a mounting political crisis. With the country's foreign reserves shrinking to almost nothing, and its foreign debt totalling more than $51bn (PS42bn), Sri Lanka is on the verge of bankruptcy. It has been unable to import fuel, food and medicines, leading to dangerous shortages, and has temporarily defaulted on its foreign loans. Wickremesinghe confirmed in Monday's speech that supplies of 14 critical medicines on the island were running out. The financial crisis has led to a mass protest movement against the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and other members of his powerful ruling family who have been held responsible for catastrophic economic mismanagement. While Mahinda Rajapaksa, the president's older brother, resigned as prime minister last week, Gotabaya Rajapaksa has continued to refuse to bow to the demands of the majority of the electorate and has held on to power. It was Gotabaya Rajapaksa who appointed Wickremesinghe as the interim prime minister last week with the task of overseeing a cross-party government to help steer the country out of the crisis and secure emergency bailouts from international organisations. While Wickremesinghe, who has been prime minister five times before, belongs to a party in opposition to the Rajapaksas, he is also seen as close to the family as well as being a steady pair of hands for the economy. His appointment angered many protesters who view him as part of the old political establishment and he was accused of propping up the Rajapaksa family by taking on the position. However, Wickremesinghe has insisted he supports the buoyant protest movement and over the weekend set up a committee to look after the protest camp they have set up in Colombo. In his speech, Wickremesinghe also admitted he would have to temporarily continue with some problematic economic policies. 'Against my own wishes, I am compelled to permit printing money in order to pay state-sector employees and to pay for essential goods and services,' he said. On Monday, Sri Lanka's main opposition party said they would offer support for Wickremesinghe's new government in any progressive policies they put forward, but would refuse to hold any seats in the cabinet until Gotabaya Rajapaksa agreed to step down.", "d3f4363c3f02bf1a45385c090e097131ba86cfd98e3720e83066c336": "The massacre by a white supremacist gunman of Black shoppers at a Buffalo grocery store has drawn renewed scrutiny of Republican figures in the US who have embraced the racist 'great replacement theory' he is alleged to have used as justification for the murders. Born from far-right nationalism, the extremist ideology expounding the view that immigration will ultimately destroy white values and western civilization has found favor not only with media figures, such as conservative Fox News host Tucker Carlson, but a host of elected politicians and others seeking office. Those who have convinced themselves Democrats are operating an open-door immigration policy to 'replace' Republican voters with people of color and keep themselves in power permanently include congresswoman Elise Stefanik, chair of her party's House conference, and JD Vance, the Donald Trump-approved Republican nominee to represent Ohio in the US Senate. After the Buffalo shooting, the pair are among those receiving blowback for encompassing the conspiracy theory that the killer referred to repeatedly in an online manifesto authorities believe he posted to justify the attack. Citing 'despicable' Facebook advertisements promoting great replacement theory Stefanik utilized in 2021, in which she said 'radical Democrats are planning their most aggressive move yet: a permanent election insurrection,' the Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger blasted his House colleague. 'Did you know: @EliseStefanik pushes white replacement theory? The #3 in the house GOP @Liz_Cheney got removed for demanding truth. @GOPLeader should be asked about this,' he said in a tweet, referring to Wyoming Republican Cheney's ousting by House minority leader Kevin McCarthy over her place on the 6 January panel. Kinzinger, of Illinois, is the only other Republican on the House committee looking into Donald Trump's efforts to overturn his election defeat to Joe Biden. He also attacked Stefanik this week for a tweet in which she accused Democrats of being 'pedo grifters' - meaning pedophiles - for providing baby formula for immigrant babies at the southern border during a national shortage. Meanwhile Vance, who credits the former president's endorsement for helping him to victory in last week's Ohio primary, is another vocal exponent of the discredited theory. 'You're talking about a shift in the democratic makeup of this country that would mean we never win, meaning Republicans would never win a national election in this country ever again,' he claimed at a campaign event in Portsmouth last month. Josh Mandel, who was defeated by Vance, went even further in an interview on Breitbart in October. 'This is about changing the face of America, figuratively and literally. They are trying to change our culture, change our demographics and change our electorate. This is all about power,' he said, without acknowledging that only US citizens can vote, and the path to citizenship can take legal immigrants many years. In a study of the history of great replacement theory in Republican circles, Vice notes that it 'isn't new to American politicians'. In 2017, the Iowa congressman Steve King, a fierce Trump loyalist, said in a tweet: 'We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies'. Arguably the biggest rightwing apologist for great replacement theory, however, is Carlson, the Fox News host. On his show last year, he stated: 'Demographic change is the key to the Democratic Party's political ambitions. In order to win and maintain power, Democrats plan to change the population of the country.' His 'nefarious' stance, the Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent wrote: 'exposes the ideological underbelly of the broader right-wing populist nationalist movement that he and his defenders champion.' Buffalo was not the first time a mass shooter with white supremacist motivations had cited great replacement theory. It also featured in the manifesto of a gunman who slaughtered 51 Muslims at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March 2019. After the Christchurch murders, the UK-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a counter-extremist organization, issued a report that found the once-obscure ideology was promoted so effectively by the far right that it became ingrained in political discourse, and that social media references doubled in four years to more than 1.5m Twitter mentions alone. 'It's shocking to see the extent to which extreme-right concepts such as the great replacement theory and calls for 'remigration' have entered mainstream political discourse and are now referenced by politicians who head states and sit in parliaments,' Julia Ebner, the report's co-author, said at the time. The effect of the backlash against US politicians promoting the theory following the Buffalo attack remains to be seen. The pugilistic Stefanik, for example, was not backing down on Sunday, making no mention of the massacre in her home state as she retweeted criticism of Democrats over the baby formula shortage. Her only social media comment to date, a single tweet on Saturday, failed to acknowledge the race of most of the victims, or the circumstances or motivation for the shooting.", "1f06244d1a7148b273b30a67538c1389e96805fde06ab170597c0c16": "The Bank of England governor has blamed the war in Ukraine for the highest inflation in the UK for three decades and warned that 'apocalyptic' food prices caused by Russia's invasion could have a disastrous impact on the world's poor. Defending Threadneedle Street before an announcement on Wednesday of the sharpest annual increase in four decades, Andrew Bailey told MPs that while he was unhappy about the level of price rises, 80% of the inflation target overshoot was caused by factors outside the Bank's control. Bailey said the Bank could not have been expected to predict a war in Ukraine, which he warned would have consequences for the UK and the developing world. Countries such as Egypt and Tunisia rely heavily on exports of Ukraine's wheat and cooking oil, and the governor said his concerns about food supplies had been heightened after speaking to Kyiv's finance minister at last month's IMF meeting in Washington. 'He said he was optimistic about crop planting, but at the moment there was no way of shipping the food out, and it's getting worse,' Bailey said. 'That's not just a major worry for this country, but a worry for the developing world. I'm sorry for being apocalyptic, but it is a worry.' Amid growing concern about Britain's cost-of-living crisis, the head of the CBI, Tony Danker, called on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to offer immediate help to those struggling to feed themselves at a time of rising food and energy prices. The director-general of the employers' organisation said there was a 'moral imperative' on the government to act. Official figures due out on Wednesday are expected to show the annual inflation rate climbing above 9%, with the Bank of England expecting the figure to climb above 10% when the energy price cap is raised further in October. Asked if the Bank could have prevented inflation from soaring by raising interest rates sooner, Bailey told the Treasury select committee: 'I don't think we could. I don't think we could foresee a war in Ukraine. 'Another factor that we're dealing with at the moment is a further leg of Covid, which is affecting China. We have seen a series of supply shocks coming one after another, and that's unprecedented.' The Bank's nine-strong monetary policy committee has raised interest rates at its last four meetings after it doubled its forecast for the peak in inflation this year from 5% to 10%. 'I don't feel at all happy and it's a bad situation to be in,' the governor said after MPs asked him to explain why the Bank had waited until December before acting. In the wake of reports at the weekend that unnamed cabinet ministers had questioned whether the Bank should remain independent, Bailey said: 'This is the biggest test of the monetary policy framework in 25 years. There is no question about that.' The governor reiterated the call for pay restraint that he made in February, urging the best-paid to set an example to workers earning less. 'I do think people, particularly people who are on higher earnings, should think and reflect on asking for high wage increases,' he said. 'It's a societal question. But I am not preaching about this. It's not for me to go around telling people what to do. 'In that sense, I know I may have been interpreted as doing that, but I wasn't. What I was saying is that maybe people should reflect on it, particularly people in that situation.' Paul Nowak, deputy general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: 'It is unbelievable that the Bank of England has repeated its calls for workers to take a wage hit - while saying virtually nothing about soaring profits at the likes of BP and Shell. The last thing working people need right now - in the middle of the worst living standards crisis in generations - is to have their wages held down.'  Asked about the future dangers to the cost of living, Bailey said there could be prolonged supply-chain bottlenecks as a result of disruption in China or higher energy prices if Russia decided to cut off gas supplies. However, he said the Bank could not have been expected to foresee recent events. 'I do see comments based on hindsight, but we have to take [monetary policy] decisions based on the facts and evidence at the time.' His comments followed an announcement by Great Britain's energy regulator, Ofgem, that it was planning to make changes to its price cap four times a year, as opposed to twice at present. The regulator on Monday published a consultation on proposals to introduce new reviews of the price cap in January and July, adding to existing changes in April and October, in an attempt to respond more quickly to volatile markets. Meanwhile, the RAC revealed that the average price of diesel at forecourts had hit a record of just over PS1.80 a litre, with experts warning of further rises if EU plans to ban Russian oil imports go ahead.

Latin patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa told reporters that Friday's incident, broadcast around the world, was a 'disproportionate use of force' against a large crowd of people waving Palestinian flags as they proceeded from the hospital to a nearby Catholic church in Jerusalem's Old City. The attack drew worldwide condemnation and added to the shock and outrage over the death of Abu Akleh, who was killed during an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) operation in the occupied West Bank. The police attack, Pizzaballa told reporters, 'is a severe violation of international norms and regulations, including the fundamental human right of freedom of religion, which must be observed also in a public space.'  There was no immediate Israeli response. Israel and the Palestinians are locked in a war of narratives over Abu Akleh's killing. The reporter, a Palestinian-American, a Catholic and a 25-year veteran of the satellite channel, was shot on Wednesday while covering an Israeli military raid in the Jenin refugee camp, while wearing a blue vest clearly marked 'Press'. Abu Akleh was a household name across the Arab world, known for documenting the hardship of Palestinian life under Israeli rule. Palestinian officials and witnesses, including journalists who were with her, say she was killed by army fire. The military, after initially saying Palestinian gunmen might have been responsible, later backtracked and said it was not clear who had fired the deadly bullet. The United States and United Nations are among the many critics of the police crackdown at the funeral. Israeli police say they agreed on funeral arrangements ahead of time with Abu Akleh's family, and that a crowd of mourners violated that agreement by marching with the coffin, instead of driving with it, and shouting nationalistic slogans. But Abu Akleh's brother, Anton, disputed those claims. He said Monday that the family had given the funeral arrangements to Israeli police.  Israeli police launched an investigation into the conduct of the officers who attacked the mourners, almost causing the pallbearers to drop the casket. Meanwhile, Israel and the Palestinians have continued to argue over the investigation into the shooting. Israel has asked to examine the bullet, saying it must be analysed by ballistics experts before any firm conclusions are reached. Palestinian officials have refused, saying they don't trust Israel. Human rights groups says Israel has a poor record of investigating wrongdoing by its security forces.

Maria Elisa Quinteros, the president of the gender-equal, 154-member assembly will formally present the draft at a ceremony in the port city of Antofagasta on Monday afternoon. 'This is an ecological and equal constitution with social rights at its very core,' she said in an interview. Among the long list of rights and freedoms the draft enshrines, the new constitution makes higher education free, ensures gender parity across government and makes the state responsible for preventing, adapting to and mitigating climate change. The constitution will be put to a referendum on 4 September in which all Chileans aged 18 or older must vote. Chile exploded into protest in 2019 and millions of people took to the streets decrying a host of entrenched inequalities. In response, political parties struck a compromise to move towards replacing the Pinochet-era constitution. Nearly 80% of voters chose to begin that journey in an October 2020 plebiscite, and seven months later leftists and independents stormed elections for a constitutional convention. 'With every bill that passed, we have provided answers to the demands of the 2019 demonstrations, such as better healthcare, education and pensions,' Quinteros said. The new document will for the first time offer constitutional recognition to Chile's Indigenous population. 'Whether this constitution is rejected or approved [by the plebiscite], I believe that Chile's Indigenous peoples have already won,' said Rosa Catrileo, who represents the Mapuche, the country's largest Indigenous group. 'We have made our demands visible on a national level, and so never again will we be excluded from the conversation,' she said. The new document even includes a clause for the compensated restitution of historically Indigenous lands. Among a host of other changes, it opts to eliminate the senate in favour of a single-chamber legislature, and paves the way for Chile's deeply unpopular private water rights system to be replaced. Since July last year, the former congress building in Santiago has been the stage for a lengthy and often bitter public battle over Chile's future. The process was designed around participation, with citizens able to endorse articles and debate legislation at assemblies the length of Chile. As the country confronted its past head-on, delegates have occasionally been hounded by the public, while a vociferous campaign to undermine the process has raged in the background. Although the Pinochet-era constitution was reformed significantly under the presidency of Ricardo Lagos in 2005, it retains the ideological fingerprints of Chile's dictator. It omits certain rights, such as the right to housing, and focuses on securing the legacy of the military regime as well as a market-led model for the provision of social services. With 499 articles, Chile's new constitution would be the world's longest, prompting some concern over the 'maximalist' approach taken by the delegates. The convention has divided into three commissions: one to streamline and condense the document; another to plot the transition from one constitution to the next; and a third to write a preamble. However, the outlook is uncertain ahead of September's plebiscite. Latest polling suggests that initial enthusiasm for reform has dissipated, with 46% saying they will reject the draft compared with 38% voting in its favour. 'There's a chance that we'll replace an illegitimate, authoritarian constitution with a divisive and ill-defined one,' said Kenneth Bunker, the director of tresquintos.cl, a political analysis website. Chile's progressive new president, Gabriel Boric, has endured a tough start to his presidency with plummeting approval ratings, but was quick to voice his support for the convention after winning December's election. 'It's not wise to equate the success of the government with the success of a plebiscite,' said Bunker, who believes that a narrow mandate for the new document could prolong Chile's political upheaval. If the draft is approved by a majority, it will be ratified as Chile's new constitution. If it is rejected, the 1980 document will remain in force.", "f54b79b28d3cc3d326a7a0f022a7ba92bcc8c600ab031bcbcca851b8": "Elon Musk's relationship with Twitter's management has reached a new low after the social media company's would-be-owner tweeted a poo emoji at the platform's chief executive. The Tesla CEO was responding on Monday to a lengthy and nuanced thread posted by his Twitter counterpart, Parag Agrawal, explaining the company's policy on spam accounts - an issue that had prompted Musk to announce on Friday that he was putting the $44bn (PS36bn) deal on hold. Musk has disputed Twitter's assertion that less than 5% of its users are fake or spam accounts and has said he will carry out his own audit. Agrawal explained that tackling automated spam accounts was a 'dynamic' process that required fighting 'sophisticated and hard to catch' actors. He added that some accounts that appear to be spam are in fact operated by real people. 'The hard challenge is that many accounts which look fake superficially are actually real people. And some of the spam accounts which are actually the most dangerous - and cause the most harm to our users - can look totally legitimate on the surface,' he wrote. He added that estimating Twitter's fake account numbers could not be done externally because the process required access to sensitive data such as IP addresses and phone numbers. Agrawal ended the thread with a link to a company blogpost on spam accounts, while revealing that Twitter had discussed how it estimated its spam number with Musk a week ago and that the company looked forward 'to continuing the conversation with him'. Musk responded with a poo emoji, followed minutes later by asking how advertisers on Twitter knew what they were getting for their money. 'So how do advertisers know what they're getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,' he tweeted. On Saturday Musk tweeted that Twitter's legal team had accused him of violating a non-disclosure agreement by revealing that the sample size for the social media platform's checks on automated users was 100. Last month, Musk engaged with tweets criticizing Twitter employees, despite the entrepreneur agreeing not to 'disparage' the company or its representatives while he completes the deal to acquire the social media platform. Musk's behavior has prompted speculation that he is laying the groundwork to reprice the deal or walk away from it, which would carry the cost of a $1bn break fee for the world's richest man. Some experts doubt whether the multibillionaire is serious about buying the company. 'I honestly don't know if Elon wants to buy Twitter,' said Drew Pascarella, a senior lecturer on finance at Cornell University. 'At first, I thought he wasn't serious. Then he paired with banks and financiers and came up with a legitimate acquisition plan. Now he's called a timeout about an issue that is both well known and should have no bearing on his future plan for the company. If it's attention he's seeking, he has it. But does he want to own Twitter? Did he ever?'", "5e5753793da4dea0caa060b59cfd0b7ee5c63c6d1c2471e000b0822a": "", "87c71ec2ff5f3407eb7014773c51862cd4c3ef051f9d9dae9636d714": "", "79c5d47d0c251e6dc19166619b2d99e43378d07b401b6875b963a545": "", "573e5268502997e69b433f53a10c1c5d300a42453fa338d4050264f2": "", "e296609218edad7551cf2813bb1ca73926c8ab3c257587b4de571b5e": "Omar Abu al-Ouf is revising for his final school exams, hoping to do well enough to pursue his dream of becoming an engineer, but it's difficult for the 17-year-old to focus. His mind constantly drifts to his family, all of whom died last year when an Israeli airstrike destroyed their apartment building in a middle-class neighbourhood of Gaza city. 'It's like he goes somewhere else,' said his grandmother, Manar, in the living room of the boy's uncle's house, where he now lives. 'His whole family is gone, for nothing.' Ouf spent 12 hours under the collapsed building, his arm around the body of his 12-year-old sister, Tala. His brother Tawfik, 17, remained alive for several hours; they talked to each other in the darkness, choking on rubble dust. Tawfik told him that their mother, Reem, was dead; before rescue teams could reach them, Tawfik too died from his injuries. Their father, Ayman, an internal medicine specialist at Gaza's main hospital, was also killed in the attack. The 11-day conflict last May between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, left Ouf totally alone. A year on, the teenager still suffers from nerve problems in his right arm and leg. He is trying to rebuild his life, he said, but still can't make sense of what happened. 'Ramadan and Eid this year were very hard. I miss them every day. I didn't think my life would be like this,' he said. 'I don't go out much. Sometimes my friends come see me here, but we have all got to study now. The only hobby I have since the incident is crying.' Ouf is now living with his uncle's family, not far from his old home on al-Wehda Street, a busy thoroughfare filled with apartment blocks, shops and cafes where 44 people were killed in the Israeli strike on 16 May last year. The attack was the single deadliest incident in the conflict, which left 256 Palestinians in Gaza and 14 people in Israel dead. The Israel Defence Forces said the civilian deaths on Wedha Street were 'unintended', caused by the collapse of the underground foundations of a targeted Hamas military structure which brought down the housing blocks on the street above. Rights groups such as Amnesty International have said that the incident may constitute a war crime. A year later, just 5% of the 1,000 housing units, roads and other infrastructure destroyed by the bombardment of the Gaza Strip have been rebuilt, according to the Hamas housing ministry. Much UN and other funding from external donors is often held up in lengthy diplomatic talks or impeded by the Israeli and Egyptian authorities, which have blockaded the area since the Islamist group seized control in 2007. The de facto siege has led to a collapsed healthcare system, poisoned Gaza's water, and leaves the small area's two million inhabitants struggling to cope with rolling power cuts. The rubble from the last round of fighting may have been cleared, but gaping holes and sandy lots strewn with rubbish remain, a daily reminder of the lives and homes lost. On a poster hanging opposite Ouf's destroyed home, the faces of three children killed in the last round of hostilities, in 2014, also peer down on passers-by. Tensions between Hamas and Israel are on the rise again. The militant group's leaders have praised a recent spate of terrorist attacks targeting Israelis that have left 19 people dead, and urged Palestinian citizens of Israel and those living in the occupied West Bank to carry out more attacks. Hamas has also threatened another all-out war if recent clashes at Jerusalem's Aqsa mosque compound continue. In response, Israeli officials have reportedly relayed a warning to Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' top leader inside Gaza, that his latest speeches inciting terrorism give Israel the freedom to respond militarily. Israel closed the only frontier crossing to most of the 12,000 Palestinians in Gaza with permission to work outside for two weeks, and Israeli media have reported that the government is considering restricting their numbers in future. The loss of income has added to the daily misery in a place where a whole generation has now grown up trapped in the overcrowded, polluted coastal enclave: unemployment in Gaza is running at about 50%, and workers commuting to Israel are worried that they will no longer be able to bring home $1.5m in collective earnings each day. Ouf, who has already lost everything, says he doesn't care if there is another war. He hopes to leave Gaza one day - maybe to study abroad - but the future is too overwhelming to think about. 'It's hard to express all the things I feel,' he said. 'I was going to work hard, celebrate my exam results, go to university ... I wanted to make my father proud of me. But instead, I am alone.'", "6d954139532a92d28f45b52e646b44b8d669e3643321c747821085e4": "", "5b7c3ac66e6f93123e0f8cae769b8b0b91d0426f70248179d490d2b8": "", "a76ae6efc12d1f0b4c97847866d47370170b16dd2f36ee971d805d11": "", "7a566af283b51bf17294f89208f369b8ed0b9783fbb9ad097391b09d": "", "443865a826f1734eb8750c068008f7491b1a1a7e706b8e6ea1893901": "", "e980d94e1757240f15193542398f0a9b97595b4e3b9b81196a3be06d": "", "82bbdc82706cd2a494344979bf8cbe3fee31a57e3de92fd5e94ea4db": "", "f5f4273f17ab328ddd08af5746b5791fcd692944ba635e6020e7886b": "", "4df3b7ac38d8f8693e0a12db953de5f23eb18f2237efd042d5be3f50": "", "e779b3dd69fbd59afb6802f26611b0a55b667a3a417198985fbff0f7": "", "bceadcb565d86a83bd82c7b382623d74eac7253007c9d4ca23558f8d": "", "5139a8dab1720a19f8aef8ed5672203f1373019025811c2894267148": "From his perch in the orchestra pit of the Oberammergau stage, Christian Stuckl nods and points to his players above, trying to offer them helpful instructions as their dress rehearsal to a half-full house of mainly local people gets under way. 'It is hard to believe we've got this far. I keep waiting for something to go wrong, but apart from a couple of older men forgetting their lines there's really nothing to complain about,' the director says at the end of the five-and-a-half-hour show. The villagers of Oberammergau in the Bavarian Alps are in a state of excitement. Their 'passion play' - which in 1633 their forebears vowed to God they would stage every 10 years if they were spared further deaths from the plague (they were) - is back again after having been thrown off its usual schedule by two years owing to the latest pandemic. Depicting the life, persecution, death and resurrection of Jesus, the 42nd season of what is believed to be the oldest continuous running amateur theatre production in the world will open on Saturday with a 103-performance run until October. The play is the village's raison d'etre. It is taken for granted that almost every one of the 5,200 residents who is eligible, from babies to nonagenarians, plays a part either on or off the stage. All children are allowed, as is anyone who has lived in the village for 20 years or more. 'The last time we had to delay was 100 years ago, due to the Spanish flu, as well as deaths and injuries from the first world war, after which it was rescheduled for 1922,' Stuckl says. 'Pandemics and the passion play have a certain tradition.' Despite misgivings over whether it would be able to go ahead, the usual decree went out on Ash Wednesday last year, forbidding male participants from cutting their hair or shaving their beards until the production closed the following October. 'It was hard for us to believe until recently that it would actually go ahead as the coronavirus infection rate had exploded, but most of us stuck to the rules and didn't cut our beards in the hope it still would,' said Werner Richter, a taxi driver who has taken part in every production since 1970. His grandchildren are among the 400 youngsters on stage and his son, Andreas, a former Jesus and a psychologist by profession, has one of the lead roles as the high priest Caiaphas. About 400 players who had signed up to take part in 2020 were forced to drop out, some due to changing life plans, others owing to their refusal to be vaccinated or to take a daily test. The Catalan donkey Sancho, on whose back Jesus was due to ride into Jerusalem, has gone into retirement, replaced by the younger Aramis. 'But luckily we have continuity where it matters, as most of those in the 42 lead roles have stuck with it,' Stuckl says. The pandemic aside, his main challenge ever since becoming director at the age of 24 in 1990 has been to retain the existing but ageing audience while pushing the boundaries of the conservative Bavarian Catholic perspective he has often viewed as limited. He describes his biggest mission as trying to rid the passion play of the antisemitic view that Jews were collectively responsible for the death of Jesus, for which it was especially instrumentalised in the Nazi era with Hitler visiting twice.  'We are in constant and deep dialogue with religious representatives now,' Stuckl says. In 2010 he depicted Jesus lifting the Torah as the choir sang a version of the Jewish prayer Shema Yisrael, considered a high point of the play by participants and spectators. This year there is a new musical setting in Hebrew of Psalm 22 ('My God, My God, Why have you forsaken me?') by the music director Markus Zwink, which is to be released internationally on a recording of the entire two-hour soundtrack for the first time. The cast is also more diverse this year than it has ever been, including refugee children and Muslim actors in lead roles. In the context of the play's history this is a radical move, and Stuckl points out the storm that erupted in 1990 when he let a Protestant on to the stage for the first time - triggering a petition by the local priest that 1,800 people signed, hoping to push the director out. He is also working on how to boost the role of women (married women over 35 were unable to take part until a court ruling 32 years ago). 'The production is very overladen with men,' he admits. 'But then it is a very male-laden story.' He has considerably expanded the time spent on the stage by Jesus's mother, Mary, as well as Veronica, who wipes his face, and Mary Magdalene, considered to be his closest female follower, and he has introduced the role of Pilate's wife, previously mentioned only by a male servant who voiced her objection over Jesus's treatment. In his dressing room backstage at the 5,200-seat theatre, 41-year-old Frederik Mayet, who alternates playing Jesus with another actor, shows some of his props and aids. There is a climbing belt that fits beneath his loin cloth and keeps him fastened safely to the cross during the crucifixion scene, and a menacing-looking crown of thorns with blunted spikes. Outside, leaning against the wall, is the three-metre grey wooden crucifix itself, all 90kg of it, which he must carry. 'It is as heavy as it looks,' he jokes. For Mayet - whose family first participated in the play in 1890 and whose children, three and eight, are with him on stage - the perennial question, as it is for most Oberammergauers, is how to ensure the play remains relevant. 'As a community our passion for the play and our courage to believe in it is unabated,' he says. 'Fundamentally the story for me is less about the theological details and more about emphasising its relevance to our experience of being human.' Mayet also played Jesus in 2010. 'But now the world is a different place,' he says, referring in particular to the effects of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the increasing displacement of people and mounting ecological disaster. This time his Jesus is - under Stuckl's direction - 'more political, more angry, someone looking for social justice.' He has sought inspiration, he says, everywhere he can find it. It is thanks to the entrepreneur excursion salesman Thomas Cook, who discovered the play for himself in 1880 and began selling passion play package tours, that it has such a big following abroad. Its single biggest set of fans are from the US. But this year the war in Ukraine has already put off tens of thousands of Americans, who have cancelled their trips to Europe. To make up the shortfall, the call has gone out to Germans to come to discover the play. Otherwise the focus in the village is on getting through unscathed to October. The biggest dread, widely voiced, is that both Jesuses go down with coronavirus at the same time. Stuckl says when it is over he will go on retreat to an ashram in India, 'happy to get Jesus out of my head'. Janina Nowotka, a hairdresser, says she'll be waiting for the queues of men outside her salon. 'They are desperate to get their hair cut by then,' she says. 'They come in and are given a beer and the mood is jovial and festive. And those that can't wait just stand on the street and lop each other's hair off.' ", "1f8b16d5bee642e7afb3f860339fb6a8180e943ef49af10625146abf": "The Southwestern rail service trundling back and forth between Kyiv and Borodianka, a small town 35 miles north of the Ukrainian capital, has played a number of roles in recent years. Before 24 February, when Vladimir Putin launched his war, it was a busy commuter route for those who worked in Kyiv but preferred the price and pace of suburbia, bringing people to and from sleepy satellite towns such as Irpin, Bucha and Vorzel. In early March this year it was spoken of in more ominous terms, as the destruction of the rail bridge over the river between Irpin and Kyiv heralded the terrifying advance of Russian forces. The names of Borodianka, Bucha, Vorzel and Irpin will long be associated in the public memory with mass graves, torture and suffering. This week, however, as the service resumed its route over the hastily rebuilt bridge, completed in just a month, the train has become a symbol of hope, and even national renaissance. The president of the European investment bank, Werner Hoyer, predicted earlier in the week that Ukraine would require a 'multitrillion-euro' injection to rebuild its shattered cities, towns and villages. For now, the people of the Kyiv oblast, or region, are making do with hammers, wrenches, brooms and a grim determination to move on. But the resumption of this train service adds a sorely needed ray of hope, even as the war rages on in the east and south of Ukraine. There are only two services up and running as yet: one leaving at 5.20am from Kyiv-Svyatoshin, a small station on the edge of the capital, that goes up and down the line to Borodianka, stopping 11 times, and a second scheduled service at 17.52. In the early hours of Wednesday, Oleksandr Pylypenko, 68, and his wife, Galyna, 64, were standing in the cold and dark on platform 1 with a small bag of tools. They were going to inspect their home in Borodianka, at the end of the line and one of the most devastated of Kyiv's satellite towns, from where they had fled four days before the war. 'I am told the roof is damaged and so we are going to clean it up a bit,' Oleksandr said. Galyna added: 'We can't move back yet but the local authority has promised to rebuild Borodianka by the winter and I hope they can.' Sitting in the first carriage waiting for them as the train pulled into the station were two conductors, Olga Feschenko, 56, and Iryna Lepel, 46. 'This is our first time,' said Feschenko. 'I have only heard about what happened in these places.' She added: 'This route is very important to a lot of people because they can't get work in their towns. A lot of people don't have cars, so for those who left this is the way back.' Valentyna Chayka, 66, and her friend Nina Galaka, 60, had mistimed their arrival at the station and were out of breath as they settled into their seats behind the conductors. Chayka started work again this week as a concierge in a block of flats in Kyiv, thanks to the resumed service. She was returning to her home in a village near Borodianka after a night shift. Galaka was also making her first step in moving on - but one that was far harder to bear. The house in which she was born and had lived all her life had been destroyed after she fled in March. She was going to the fire department to get a document to confirm it was uninhabitable - a first step towards hopefully receiving compensation. 'That was my life,' she said, unable to control her tears. After 20 minutes, the train pulled in at Irpin, where Zinaida Maksymets, 64, was getting off. A breeder of prize-winning American cocker spaniels, she was one of those who had clambered across the remains of the blown-up road bridge in March to get out of the town - although her experience was different from most. 'I had four dogs on a lead and six puppies in two boxes going over that river', she said. 'Some terrible people had said I should leave the dogs but I would never do that.' Outside Irpin's station, Maksymets walked up Alley of the Fallen, a pedestrianised street with shops, pharmacies and cafes, all damaged, on either side of a promenade of statues and monuments to the Soviet Union's sacrifices in 1941-1945. Her flat, a five-minute walk from the station, had been hit, although a mere graze compared to the damage elsewhere. According to the mayor of Irpin, nearly three-quarters of the town's buildings have been damaged by missiles, artillery, machine-gun fire and all manner of explosives during the Russian occupation and battle of Kyiv. The cost of rebuilding is said to be close to PS1bn. It will be a long haul, but the roads are now clean, the water and electricity has returned, and early on Wednesday morning Oleksandr Prabdyvyi, 71, was sweeping the remnants of glass outside the Fora supermarket that had hired him for the job. Further into town, Valeriy Vitrak, 58, and Anatoliy Masyuk, 59, were making repairs at Irpin's central hospital which, despite red crosses daubed on its sides, had been hit by missiles and raked with automatic gun fire. There was also a sign of the revival of enterprise down one leafy residential road. No 38 Pavlenka Street was completely flattened, but a laminated note attached to a tree outside bore a phone number and a message: 'We can repair your roof, install your windows, everything can be made new with our materials. We have experience of rebuilding from nothing.' The next stop on the train's route, six minutes along, is Bucha, perhaps the most infamous of the towns in the Kyiv region. Close to the 120-year-old railway station, Maryna Bazylyuk, 48, was opening up Olga's hairdresser for the day. 'There are 23 hairdressers in Bucha but there are only two open at the moment,' she said. The salon clients' conversations are not what they were. 'There are a lot of tears,' she said. 'I have had a lady in who said the Russians killed her husband but she can't find his body.' There were more men than women coming in, she said. 'Women looked after themselves during the occupation but men come in with long hair', she laughed, before adding: 'One man who came said his son was killed. He was inconsolable.' Bazylyuk said the salon, which opened two days ago, was getting busier, roads were being rebuilt and the military detritus was being cleared up. 'It will take a long time, but this is our home and we won't let them ruin it for us, no matter what happened.' Eight minutes further down the track and the train pulls into the village of Vorzel, which fell to the Russians shortly after the invasion began. Opposite the simple, rural station - nothing more than two platforms - a church is being built and Volodtmyr Holub, 37 a deacon, was helping workmen. Construction started last year but had to be put on hold when the war came. During the occupation, missiles had hit the front of it but failed to explode. 'A miracle,' said Holub, smiling. But there were no miracles for the three men found in a mass grave at the back of the construction site. Two had been shot in the head and the third appeared to have frozen to death. 'But we will finish this church in three months,' he said with pride. The final stop for the train is Borodianka. Here, 1,340 explosive devices have had to be neutralised and nearly two miles of roads cleared of mines. Two of the town's bridges are barely passable and temporary structures have been built. But the biggest problem is that 90% of the buildings in the centre have been damaged, many beyond repair. Between some football fields, close to the Church of Archangel Michael, 160 temporary homes were being erected, thanks to funding from the Polish government. By the station, Alla Lytvynenko, 56, was in her newly reopened supermarket opposite some burnt-out shops. Most of her shelves were empty. 'How was your occupation?' asked one man, before buying a bottle of vodka. Another of her customers was Iryna Kozachenko, 41, who, with her 12-year-old daughter, stayed the entire time in the town, spending 40 days and nights in her cellar. 'I didn't let my daughter wash, she was kept dirty because I was scared she would be raped,' Kozachenko said. She was reopening the Soviet-themed restaurant she manages with some apprehension. 'I don't know how people will react,' she said. 'But the best of places is our home.'", "26e117bb3b4e9a8ed135c0829659120c3dafc99c6d8490052c09e051": "The call came at about midday on Wednesday. There had been 'chemical poisoning' after a blast and patients needed collecting. Fears of a Russian chemical weapons attack have haunted Ukraine almost since the war began, and as the volunteer medics in Sloviansk pulled on the ageing gas masks and plastic overalls that were their only protection, they wondered if this was it. They set off anyway, inured to personal risks after weeks of driving through shelling to patch up the men and women injured on one of the most intensely fought-over sections of the frontline. 'We got a call saying there was a yellow-brown cloud after the hit and yellow-white flakes in the air like snow. The soldiers immediately started having breathing problems,' said Vit, a paramedic who asked to go only by his nickname, which refers to his peacetime role as mayor of a small town. He was worried about being captured and tortured by Russian troops who were just a few miles away. The ambulance team listened to the warning and then went to get the choking soldiers. Like the troops they support, they are supplementing limited, outdated equipment with courage and determination. After dropping off their patient, who had gone into spasms in the ambulance, they were told the gas came not from chemical weapons but from a chemical plant that had been hit by Russian munitions. But if the fear of one particular horror was put on hold for a moment, the other terrors of this war are drawing closer to this city in Donbas, less than 20 miles behind the frontline. 'You can win one battle then the next day there are more troops, sent back to the same place,' said Vlad, a veteran who signed up to fight again after the February invasion, and now a patient in a Sloviansk clinic. He asked not to give his last name because his family were in areas occupied by Russian troops and he feared they could face reprisals. His cheek shook when he talked about his children, and his fight was personal as well as patriotic. This corner of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions is one of the few areas where Moscow's army is still consistently gaining ground, even if their advance proceeds at a snail's pace and recent attempts to bridge a strategically important river ended in a rout. Ukraine has followed its victory in Kyiv by pushing Russian artillery back from within firing range of the country's second largest city, Kharkiv. A senior general said this week that Moscow's troops had been put on the defensive on several other key fronts, including along the Black Sea coast, and ministers have started talking about an offensive to take back territory lost in 2014. But on the rolling steppe here, geography denies the Ukrainian military some of the advantages that allowed its forces to humble Moscow's troops around the capital. Soldiers rarely get close enough to fight face to face or deploy the western anti-tank missiles that helped them save Kyiv. Instead, their artillery guns face off across vast open fields, dug in with mazes of trenches that could have come from the last century, pounding each other with shells while jets occasionally scream overhead. Many Russian guns shoot further than the ones Ukraine's military had at the start of the war, so while they wait for western weapons with a longer range - such as the M777 howitzers dispatched by the US and just starting to arrive at the frontline - they must live under constant bombardment. 'Positions where the Ukrainian army are staying are bombed with artillery, missiles and by air constantly, every day, so it gets to the point where there is nothing to hold on to in these points, that is part of the problem,' said Serhiy Haidai, the head of the military administration for the Luhansk region. 'The attacks with tanks we fight off, but we have no possibility to counter the artillery. That's why unfortunately we have to retreat. We have been holding for three months already, and Russians couldn't get through this small area. I hope the Ukrainian army will still hold these positions and - with the weapons we are waiting for - can even go into counterattack.' After the humiliation of defeat near Kyiv, Vladimir Putin doubled down instead on the battle for the eastern Donbas region, where proxy forces have held ground seized in 2014 for eight years, claiming 'independence' from Kyiv that provided a pretext for the wider invasion. The ruthless bombardment they unleashed in pursuit of this goal shows in the type and scale of the injuries treated at the Sloviansk clinic, said Svitlana Druzenko, a paediatric trauma specialist and director of the all-volunteer Priogov mobile hospital, which treated the chemical poisoning victims. She spent the first month of the war evacuating injured people from near frontlines in the capital. 'In Kyiv and the Kyiv region we didn't see such a large amount of wounded soldiers as here,' she said. 'Here we also see a lot more severe injuries: torn-off arms and legs, or we must do an amputation, and we get a lot of head trauma. The main injuries here are from blasts. Near Kyiv we also saw more gunshot wounds.' Every day they collect casualties from the frontlines, or civilians from bombed-out homes, and stabilise them and send them on to safer hospitals. They know they are targets, because the Ukrainian government says more than 500 healthcare centres have been hit. Their ambulances have been shelled - they are fundraising for armoured vehicles - they have been tracked by Russian jets, and the towns where they are based have been hit repeatedly. Some of the western weapons that Ukraine hopes will change the course of the war have started arriving on the battlefield, including M777 guns, stingers and more anti-tank Javelins, Haidai said. The head of a national guard unit that helps to protect the medics this week showed off the remains of a Russian Orlan drone that he was sending to Kyiv for analysis. His fighters had shot down the aircraft, which costs about $100,000 (PS82,000), with a US stinger missile, he said. The weapons influx was still not enough, Haidai said, but he hoped the shipments would speed up and he took heart from the Ukrainian military's continued skill in outmanoeuvring Russia when artillery was not holding troops back. In the last week Russia had twice tried to build a pontoon bridge to bring tanks and weapons round for the siege of Severodonetsk. It was bombed the first time by Ukraine, leading to a large loss of weapons and lives, and then Russian engineers started again in the same place. 'What's interesting about this bridge is the Russian tactics: they built it, tried to bring over the weapons, we got them, and they built it again and we got them again,' he said. 'It shows they are trying to win not with military intelligence but with sheer force of numbers.'", "625371446de587667e7f9af72a278a314a56de120638f24fe2f42d50": "In the run-up to Cop26, the UK government used the mantra 'Cash, coal, cars and trees to keep the world to 1.5C' to highlight four key areas on which the conference would focus. At Cop26, rich countries were supposed to fulfil a longstanding promise, made in 2009, to provide $100bn a year in climate finance to the developing world from 2020. The actual amounts provided are still falling short, but developed countries did produce evidence that they would meet the promise this year or next, with the five-year average from 2020 to 2025 at around $100bn. Developing countries have also been promised a new financial settlement that would see greater flows from 2025, with details yet to be decided. In the months since, however, there has been little advance on the Cop26 promises of cash. Rachel Kyte and Lord Stern, both former top World Bank officials, told the Guardian of several concerns over the World Bank's programmes on climate. Stern said the bank's resources would be stretched by the additional strains of high energy and food prices around the world, and the effects of the war in Ukraine. Kyte cast doubt on whether the World Bank was truly committed to the climate fight: '[The World Bank's] weak showing at Glasgow and continued questions about their appetite for urgent action has meant that coalitions form without them at the helm. Broader questions of whether the Bretton Woods institutions are fit for purpose for the climate crisis grow.' The private sector has also come under closer scrutiny. The GFANZ network - the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero - was announced with fanfare by Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and UN climate envoy. It is unclear, however, how much of that is flowing to the poorest countries that need it most. There are also questions, raised by the Guardian's carbon bubble investigation, over whether investors are pouring more money into fossil fuels, now enjoying a bonanza, rather than clean tech. There is little in the GFANZ rules to stop them. Carney said it was the job of governments to regulate and provide incentives that would encourage capital into the right directions: 'Finance will not drive the net-zero transition on its own. Finance is an enabler, a catalyst that will speed what governments and companies initiate. If there is commitment to move to a sustainable, resilient and fair energy system, and the right policies are made, finance will be there.' Coal was a clear focus of Cop26, though some of the successes the UK initially trumpeted for commitments to phase out coal turned out to be less solid than claimed. In the closing moments of the talks, coal also became a flashpoint as China and India refused to sign up to a 'phase-out' of coal, and insisted on changing the term to 'phase-down'. Since then, new evidence has emerged of coal expansion as recovery from Covid has quickened, and the war in Ukraine has spurred some countries to consider a return to coal, or a delay to its phasing out. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said coal must be at the forefront of Cop27: 'The biggest risk is the growing appetite for infrastructure investments in coal. If we are not able to slow that down or stop it, we may lock in our future ... If I had to pick one issue [for Cop27], that would be the one.' Electric vehicle sales doubled in key markets last year, as manufacturers ramped up production and consumers embraced new models. But the future of the market this year is looking more uncertain; the war in Ukraine has disrupted key supply chains, and Volkswagen in Germany said earlier this month that it had sold out of electric vehicles for this year for its EU and US markets. Other manufacturers are also struggling with rising costs and looking for alternative sources for components. Many green campaigners are also concerned that talking about cars is the wrong focus - they say we should be talking about transport. Investment in public transport, making it cheaper or even free, is one of the quickest ways to bring down demand for oil, according to the IEA.  The UK made action on forests a key focus at Cop26, with a gathering of world leaders to discuss forests and land use and a separate two-day programme of events. A deal to halt global deforestation, signed by China, the US and Brazil among other nations, was the first big 'win' of the Glasgow fortnight. But in the past months, Brazil's deforestation rate in the Amazon has soared to devastating record levels, and a report on the Congo - one of the world's most important remaining rainforests - has cast doubt on the government's willingness to take the action needed to halt logging and destruction. Meanwhile, another key forestry meeting this year - the Convention on Biological Diversity (meant to be held in Kunming, China, in 2020, but delayed) - is now in limbo due to the Chinese government's response to the resurgence of Covid-19. Whether or when the conference will take place at all is now unknown. Lord Goldsmith, the UK minister in charge of the Cop26 forestry efforts, has been on a frantic round of diplomacy this year to shore up the forest deal. He said the UK wanted world leaders to meet every year to discuss progress. 'The contribution of forestry to the overall global emissions reductions needed is potentially huge. It could contribute about 10%-15% to the global emissions target.'", "8f9f1b00c24e477ee698a6a3ec8fb7742c76743cd93ae52df67c7475": "From carbon to uranium, oxygen to iron, chemical elements are the building blocks of the world around us and the wider universe. Now, physicists are hoping to gain an unprecedented glimpse into their origins, with the opening of a new facility that will create thousands of peculiar and unstable versions of atoms never before recorded on Earth. By studying these versions, known as isotopes, they hope to gain new insights into the reactions that created the elements within exploding stars, as well as testing theories about the 'strong force' - one of the four fundamental forces in nature, which binds protons and neutrons together in an atom's nucleus. The facility could also yield new isotopes for medical use. Atoms are composed of protons, neutrons and electrons. The number of protons dictates an atom's chemical behaviour and which element it is - eg carbon always has six protons, and gold 79 - whereas atoms of the same element containing different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Because many isotopes are unstable and decay quickly - sometimes within fractions of a second - scientists have only studied a small proportion of those thought to exist. 'There are 285 isotopes of elements that exist on Earth, but we think that there are potentially 10,000 isotopes for the elements up to uranium,' said Prof Bradley Sherrill, the scientific director of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University, which officially opened on 2 May. 'The goal of FRIB is to provide as wide of an access to this vast landscape of other isotopes as technology allows.' Some of these 'rare isotopes' may drive reactions crucial to the formation of elements, so by studying them physicists hope to gain a better understanding of the chemical history of the universe - including how we got here. The vast majority of elements are thought to have been created within exploding stars, but 'in many cases we don't know which stars created which elements, because these reactions involve unstable isotopes - things we couldn't readily get our hands on,' said Prof Gavin Lotay, a nuclear physicist at the University of Surrey, who plans to use the new facility to investigate common explosions called X-ray bursts within neutron stars. Another goal is to understand atomic nuclei well enough to develop a comprehensive model of them, which could provide fresh insights into the role they play in the creation of energy for stars, or the reactions occurring within nuclear power plants. The facility could also yield medically useful isotopes. Already, doctors use radioactive isotopes in eg Pet scans and some types of radiotherapy, but the discovery of additional ones could help improve diagnostic imaging, or provide new ways of seeking out and destroying tumours. To generate these isotopes, FRIB will accelerate a beam of atomic nuclei to half the speed of light and send them shooting down a 450-metre pipe, before crashing them into a target that causes some of the atoms to fragment into smaller combinations of protons and neutrons. A series of magnets will then filter out the desired isotopes and direct them into experimental chambers for further study. 'Within a millionth of a second, we can select a particular isotope and deliver it to an experiment where [scientists] may catch it and watch for its radioactive decay, or we may use it to induce another nuclear reaction and use those reaction products to tell us something about the structure of the isotope,' Sherrill said. The first experiments will involve making the heaviest possible isotopes of fluorine, aluminium, magnesium and neon, and comparing their rates of radioactive decay with those predicted by existing models. 'The surprise will be if our observations agree with what we expected,' Sherrill said. 'Most likely they won't agree, and then we'll use that disagreement to refine our models.' Approximately a month later, FRIB researchers plan to measure the radioactive decay of isotopes thought to exist within neutron stars - some of the densest objects in the universe, formed when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses - to better understand their behaviour. 'Finally we have the tools to enable people to do research that they've been waiting 30 years to do,' said Sherrill. 'It's like having a new, bigger telescope that can see further into the universe than ever before - only we'll be seeing further in the nuclear landscape than we've ever been able to look before. Whenever you have a new tool like that, there's the potential for discovery.'", "82c44c66cb33d74bcce3ae1c4f44e71d6406151955d617defb3744d9": "The US's top infectious disease expert has said he would resign if Donald Trump retakes the presidency in 2024. Dr Anthony Fauci bluntly said 'no' when CNN's Jim Acosta asked him during an interview on Sunday if he would want to stay on as the director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases in the event that voters gave Trump a second stint as president. Fauci, 81, has led the institute since 1984, serving under seven presidents. He said he wasn't confident in Trump's ability to lead the country through a public health emergency like the coronavirus pandemic, and his administration's response at the beginning of the crisis in early 2020 was 'less than optimal'. 'If you look at the history of what the response was during the administration, I think at best you could say it wasn't optimal,' Fauci said. 'And I just think history will speak for itself. I don't need to make any further comment about that - it's not productive.' Acosta asked Fauci whether he would want to continue working his job if Trump won a second term after losing to Joe Biden in the 2020     presidential election. 'Well, no,' Fauci said, in part. Fauci and Trump have a history of clashing with each other. The former president and his fellow Republicans villainized Fauci for urging Americans to take various measures to protect them from spreading and contracting the virus which had killed 1 million people nationwide as of Monday, including wearing masks and getting vaccinated. Trump was aggravated by Fauci's frequent television appearances, calling him 'not a great doctor but a great promoter'. He attacked Fauci for being skeptical of the hotly contested theory that the deadly virus escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. 'He's been wrong on almost every issue and he was wrong on Wuhan and the lab also,' Trump said once. Fauci, in turn, criticized Trump when the former president's unsuccessful re-election campaign took Fauci's words that he couldn't imagine 'anyone ... doing more' than federal officials in general and tried to make it look in a video like he was speaking admiringly of Trump's handling of the coronavirus. 'I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate,' Fauci said at the time. 'The comments attributed to me with my permission ... were taken out of context.' Fauci this year has said the US was out of the full blown pandemic phase of the coronavirus crisis, though cases could still rise as variants and subvariants proliferate.", "c9cf71ecdabad0081ae860a2bb9bcb1b00e617a18709ee52027d1968": "The activist Leung Wing-lai was in prison when he first met Cardinal Zen. In 2018, while Leung was serving a sentence for illegal assembly, Zen visited him at a remote Hong Kong prison. On the day of the visit, Leung recalls being pulled from the prison workshop and led into a small outdoor area to have his first and only meeting out in the open while incarcerated.'The officers seemed nervous and I did not know what was going on ... then I saw Joseph Zen and immediately understood,' Leung said.'[Zen] said he had read the news and was worried about us.'Leung said he was surprised that the conversation did not revolve around faith; instead, Hong Kong's most senior Catholic cleric was interested in his life and family.'He said 'Remember, you can be angry, but do not have hatred,'' Leung said, describing the experience as a rare moment of ease in captivity. Last week, Hong Kong police from the national security department arrested Zen, 90, and four others for alleged 'collusion with foreign forces'. All of those arrested were trustees of the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, which provided legal and financial assistance to more than 2,200 people prosecuted for their part in the 2019 pro-democracy protests.The fund had ceased operations in 2021, after the police announced it was under investigation and requested administrators to provide details on its donors.Zen was released on bail on 12 May and a source close to him said the cardinal was set to appear in court on 24 May, adding it was possible that he would be further detained, should charges be laid. While in the past the arrest of a public figure like Zen would have sparked fierce debate in Hong Kong, the local church community has been largely silent so far.In a short statement published on 12 May, the Hong Kong Catholic Social Communications Office said it was 'extremely concerned' with Zen's safety. 'We have always upheld the rule of law,' the statement read. 'We trust that in the future we will continue enjoying religious freedom in Hong Kong under the Basic Law.' According to government statistics, there were 1.2 million Christians in Hong Kong as of 2020, a third of whom are Catholic. Churches in Hong Kong are largely independent from the government, although leaders of the Anglican and Catholic churches have in recent years aligned themselves with the Chinese government on political matters. Anne (a pseudonym), a lifelong Catholic and retiree, explained that views within the church were split over Zen: some thought he was too radical, while others supported his outspokenness. Those who wanted to speak out in support for Zen were worried that any public action, however mild, would create only more trouble for him. Instead, Zen's supporters kept him in their prayers and discussed his arrest in private, Anne said.Although local authorities denied the arrest had anything to do with religious freedom, Anne was worried that a crackdown on churches would spread from mainland China to Hong Kong.'Being religious is more than worshiping, we also need to do justice,' Anne said, questioning whether having faith but not the means to take action amounted to religious freedom.'In the past we extended a helping hand to others, and we did not imagine being in the same position. Now who is going to help us?' Anne said, referring to efforts by Hong Kong's church community to support independent churches in mainland China, which are suppressed by the state.Rev Prof Tobias Brandner, associate director of the Divinity School of Chung Chi College at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, described the radio silence among local churchgoers as an 'expression of fear'.Zen's arrest came amid Sino-Vatican talks over the renewal of a power-sharing agreement on the ordination of bishops in the Chinese mainland. Brandner, who moved to Hong Kong in 1996 and is also a prison chaplain, expects Zen's arrest to impede the talks.This is despite the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, telling media last Saturday that Zen's arrest was not a 'disavowal' of the Sino-Vatican agreement, adding that he hoped the incident would not 'complicate the already complex' dialogue between the two states.Brandner said: 'The fact that they did not refrain from arresting such a senior cleric ... is surely an attack on the Vatican. I expect that this has repercussions.' A staff member of the Catholic diocese of Hong Kong, who wished not to be named, was worried that Zen's arrest would put a stop to his prison visits. As a prison chaplain, Zen had access to people in custody and was not limited by a visit quota, sometimes visiting as many as three prisons a day, the staff member said.From public figures such as media tycoon Jimmy Lai to young protesters, the staff member said, Zen had brought them peace and crucial emotional support. 'It is the only time, outside of talking to your lawyer, to really speak your mind.'Rev Peter Koon, a pro-government lawmaker who was the provincial secretary general of the Hong Kong Anglican church, dismissed claims that Zen's arrest had anything to do with religious freedom in the city.'Cardinal Zen is not a bad person, he may be stubborn but I hope he will be OK, I will pray for him,' Koon said.Zen has been a stern supporter of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. In 2003, he openly opposed the government's plan to enact national security laws under article 23 of Hong Kong's Basic Law, which critics warned could damage speech and political freedoms. Zen also took part in the 2014 Occupy Central protests, which called for universal suffrage.In his first public appearance since the May arrest, Zen joined an online live stream hosted by the Hong Kong branch of the Society of Saint Francis de Sales, which brought him to the city in 1948 from Shanghai. During the live stream, Zen recounted his personal history of joining the Catholic church and his eventual appointment as the bishop of Hong Kong, but did not touch upon his recent arrest. As a closing remark, Zen told the young faithful to stay true to their calling. He said: 'You need to think for yourself, not just listen to others.'", "fddd913751e398f23707dc06d311144a5c65ec5536b1d40c24ad256b": "A manager at an Arby's fast food restaurant in Washington state has been accused of urinating into a milkshake mix that might then have been served to dozens of people. Police in Vancouver, across the Columbia River from Portland, Oregon, said they uncovered footage of the 29-year-old man peeing into a bag of milkshake mix as they were executing a search warrant on his phone as part of an investigation into child sex abuse images, the Columbian newspaper reported. The manager made one court appearance last Wednesday on child abuse image allegations and another on Friday, for a new allegation of second-degree assault with sexual motivation, after police said they found the 16-second urination video. According to a probable cause affidavit filed in Clark county superior court, the video's metadata showed it was recorded on 30 October at an Arby's in Vancouver's Mill Plain neighborhood. The manager acknowledged to investigators that he urinated in the milkshake mix bag at least twice, but said he was 'almost sure' he threw the bag out. He said he was working alone in the restaurant that night and that he did it for sexual gratification. He told detectives that if he did not throw the bag away, it would have been added to other mix by the next shift and served to customers, police said. Another manager at the Arby's told detectives the restaurant sold at least one ice cream float and about 30 to 40 milkshakes that day, court records said. In an email to the Columbian, Vancouver Police Sgt Julie Ballou said investigators had no evidence that Arby's or its franchise owner was aware of the man's 'abhorrent actions.' Clark county public health director Dr Alan Melnick told the newspaper there is no significant health risk to consuming a drink contaminated with urine. A judge raised the man's bail Friday from $5,000 to $40,000. He is scheduled to be arraigned 25 May.", "c57165256d1d33022f53ce445de5d9b14ece39f801dedff8488a0174": "E-cigarettes are as safe to use as nicotine patches for pregnant smokers trying to quit, and may be a more effective tool, researchers have revealed. Smoking in pregnancy can increase the risk of outcomes including premature birth, miscarriage and the baby having a low birth weight. But stubbing out the habit can be a struggle. 'Many pregnant smokers find it difficult to quit with current stop smoking medications including nicotine patches and continue to smoke throughout pregnancy,' said Dr Francesca Pesola, an author of the new study who is based at Queen Mary University in London. While e-cigarettes have been found to be more effective than nicotine patches in helping people quit, Pesola noted there has been little research into their effectiveness or safety among pregnant women, despite an increase in use by expectant mothers.  Writing in the journal Nature Medicine, Pesola and colleagues describe how they randomly assigned 569 pregnant smokers to use e-cigarettes and 571 to use nicotine patches - a form of nicotine replacement therapy that can already be prescribed by during pregnancy. The participants were, on average, 15.7 weeks pregnant and smoked 10 cigarettes a day. Only 40% of those given e-cigarettes and 23% of those given patches used their allocated product for at least four weeks. However, both uptake and duration of use during the study was higher among those given e-cigarettes. After excluding participants who self-reported not smoking but who used nicotine products other than those allocated to them - for example those given patches group who used e-cigarettes - the team found those given e-cigarettes appeared to do better at quitting smoking. Four weeks into their attempt to quit 15.4% of those given e-cigarettes self-reported they were not smoking, compared with 8.6% of those given patches, while 19.8% of the e-cigarette group self-reported abstinence at the end of pregnancy compared with 9.7% in the group given patches. Only a small number of participants provided saliva samples to confirm smoking abstinence at the end of pregnancy, but once those who used non-allocated products were excluded, the team found higher rates of abstinence among the e-cigarette group. In addition the team found the rates of adverse events were similar between those given cigarettes and those given patches. What's more, while the average birth weight of the babies was similar, low birth weights were more common in the patch group. However the study has limitations, including low adherence and that the e-cigarettes used in the study differ from modern pod devices.  The authors add that given questions remain about the potential risks of nicotine in pregnancy, it is preferable for pregnant women to quit smoking without using nicotine containing products. 'We would only recommend the use of nicotine to smokers wanting to quit their regular cigarettes,' said Pesola. But, she added: 'Using an e-cigarette poses no greater risk to the mother or baby than nicotine patches, which are both better options than continuing to smoke throughout pregnancy.'", "54f283ce19c90ebf1aadbb8c54d493b540885235ab5fbae297368260": "Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, has suggested the UK extradite suspects wanted in the east African country for alleged roles in the 1994 genocide, after a controversial deal with the Home Office to process asylum seekers there. Speaking less than two weeks after the deal was announced, Kagame told an audience of diplomats in Kigali that included the British high commissioner, he hoped 'that when the UK is sending us these migrants, they should send us some people they have accommodated for over 15 years who committed crimes [in Rwanda]'. 'We sent case files [to the UK] and ... investigated. These are clear case files. Instead of being accommodated there in that beautiful place of [the] UK, they should be in jail, either in the UK or here,' Kagame said. The presence in the UK of five men alleged to have played an active and important role in the killing of more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and some moderate Hutus over three months in Rwanda in 1994 has been an irritant in relations with Kigali for many years. British judges have blocked extradition on the grounds the suspects would not receive a fair trial in Rwanda. Officials in Kigali have called for a trial in the UK instead. All five, aged between 61 and 69, came to the UK in the immediate aftermath of the genocide where they applied for asylum. They deny the allegations against them. The comments will raise concerns that the British government has made undisclosed promises to Kagame, or will now find it difficult to refuse requests from Kigali on sensitive issues. Under the new deal, Rwanda will be paid an initial PS120m to receive refugees who arrive illegally in the UK. The full details of the agreement have not been made publicly available. Weeks before the deal was announced, the government confirmed the appointment of Rwanda's new ambassador to the UK, after a delay of eight months. Johnston Busingye, Rwanda's long-serving justice minister, was named as the new envoy amid international scrutiny over the alleged 'rendition' and trial of Paul Rusesabagina, the hotelier credited with saving many lives during the genocide - portrayed in the film Hotel Rwanda. On 29 April, Busingye was received by the Queen at Buckingham Palace in a virtual audience. The Home Office did not respond to requests for comment. In his speech Kagame denied the deal with the UK meant Rwanda was 'buying and selling people'. 'No, we don't do that kind of thing. We can't do that because of our core values ...'When the UK approached us and because of a problem they have ... we are happy to deal with that problem,' Kagame told the diplomats. 'There is nothing bad about this ... There is nothing we cannot be transparent about.' Kagame's reference to the five alleged genocide suspects may be embarrassing for the UK government and fuel criticism of the asylum deal. In 2019, ministers told parliament the government was 'not shielding any war criminals' and had spent PS3m 'trying to get the right outcome' on an investigation launched after the court rulings on extradition and requests from the Rwandan government. Last year, MPs formed an all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on War Crimes to 'look into matters relating to the presence of alleged Rwandan war criminals in the UK and the prosecution of those who participated in the Rwandan genocide'. In April last year, Busingye, as minister of justice, pledged that 'Rwanda does not seek revenge' and that though extradition was denied, Rwanda had agreed to a trial by the UK courts. 'We are still watching and waiting, waiting for the one signal that will show the genocide victims, in their lifetime, that finally there is commitment to bring these fugitives to justice,' he said. Rusesabagina was tricked into returning to Rwanda in August 2020, in what amounted to an enforced disappearance, a serious violation of international law, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said at the time. He was later convicted of involvement in a rebel group blamed for deadly attacks in Rwanda. A 25-year jail sentence was upheld by Rwanda's court of appeal, a ruling his family says is in effect a death sentence for the ailing 67-year-old. In his speech to the diplomats, Kagame criticised those whose understanding of Rwanda's history was based on 'a movie', a reference to Hotel Rwanda. 'He's a hero, people say ... But what about the families of the victims, people who were lost [at] the hands of this person and the group he led?' the president said. Kagame became head of state in 2000 after he and his rebel forces halted the genocide in 1994 after 100 days of killing resulted in about 800,000 deaths.  He brought stability, security and economic growth to a shattered country but has also been accused of running a repressive, authoritarian state.", "33a25b147be2f6f8b97adc8064e8a9f1ac9bd9cbe2bccf79b8071777": "The US will send up to 500 soldiers back on full-time deployment to Somalia, to train the country's army to combat the increasing threat posed by al-Shabaab militants. The White House insisted that the move, deepening the US long-term military commitment in an intractable foreign conflict, did not contradict Joe Biden's overall policy of disengaging from 'forever wars', which underlay the withdrawal from Afghanistan. The decision does not affect overall deployments in the region, officials said on Monday, but replaces a rotating deployment with a 'persistent' presence - longer tours by the same special forces soldiers. They argued the deployment should not be called permanent, as that implied the soldiers would be there forever. The move marks a reversal of Donald Trump's abrupt decision, in the last weeks of his presidency, to withdraw 750 US troops who had been stationed in Somalia until then. A senior administration official called Trump's decision 'irrational'. 'It was an abrupt and sudden transition to a rotational presence,' the official said. 'Since then, al-Shabaab, the terrorist group in Somalia that is al-Qaida's largest, wealthiest and deadliest affiliate, has unfortunately only grown stronger. It has increased the tempo of its attacks, including against US personnel.' The official said that having a rotational presence had increased the security risks to US troops as they moved in and out of the country, and had disrupted the training of Somali forces by constantly changing the US trainers. The White House said that the deployment would be 'fewer than 500' soldiers. The New York Times reported that the cap would be 450. The aim will be to boost the capacity of Somali forces to disrupt al-Shabaab sufficiently so the group is not able to plot attacks against the US, such as the January 2020 assault on the American airbase at Manda Bay in Kenya. That same month, US prosecutors charged a Kenyan national with involvement in an al-Shabaab plot to carry out a 9/11-style attack on a US city. The Kenyan had been trying to learn how to fly large planes in the Philippines when he was arrested. The Pentagon proposed the change some months ago, and Biden is reported to have approved the decision earlier this month, but the timing of the announcement was determined in part by the re-election by the country's parliament on Sunday of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, ending months of uncertainty. Outgoing president Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed's term ended in February 2021 without an election. The protracted dispute that followed turned violent at times and caused divisions at the highest levels of government. On Monday, the United Nations, the African Union, the EU and diplomats congratulated Mohamud and expressed hopes that his election would enable political reconciliation. 'This is someone with whom we are familiar given that he served as president 2012 to 2017,' the senior US official said. 'Maybe even more importantly, I would say that across Somali leadership there is consistency in terms of support for collaboration on counter-terrorism.' The official suggested the decision had taken time because of Biden's caution over sending US troops into a conflict zone. 'He takes seriously his obligation to ask tough questions and to make sure he understands the full ramifications - the risks as well as the potential benefits,' the official said. 'Once he worked through that process, once he had his questions answered, he was ultimately comfortable approving this proposal from the secretary of defence.'", "5991d09667b74164780d41e341683901bb9d4b228f8e963c18acafd3": "Wyoming congresswoman Liz Cheney has accused her Republican party leadership of enabling 'white nationalism, white supremacy, and antisemitism', in a scathing message after the racist massacre at a grocery store in Buffalo. Cheney, who was removed from her position as the No 3 House Republican last year after she joined the panel investigating the 6 January Capitol attack, urged party leaders in a tweet to 'renounce and reject these views and those who hold them'. Her remarks were made amid increasing scrutiny of Republican figures who have embraced the racist 'great replacement theory' the Buffalo killer is said to have cited in a manifesto he used to justify the murders. The far-right ideology expounds the view that immigration will ultimately destroy white values and western civilization. Although a growing number of Republican lawmakers and hopefuls have promoted the discredited conspiracy theory, including JD Vance, the Donald Trump-endorsed candidate who won last week's Republican Senate primary in Ohio, many believe Cheney's message is directed at one person: the Republican House conference chair, Elise Stefanik. The New York congresswoman, who was swiftly installed to replace Cheney when the House minority leader and Trump loyalist, Kevin McCarthy, orchestrated Cheney's ouster last year, has used the great replacement theory to make false accusations that Democrats were plotting a 'permanent election insurrection' by replacing white voters with immigrants. The Illinois congressman Adam Kinzinger, who is the only other Republican on the House panel investigating Trump's insurrection efforts, posted his own tweet slamming Stefanik's promotion of the theory as 'despicable'. On Sunday he added another post, demanding that Stefanik, McCarthy and extremist Republican congress members Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn be 'replaced'. McCarthy is one of five Republicans who received subpoenas from the House panel last week as it seeks more information about Trump's actions to overturn his election defeat by Joe Biden, including the deadly riots at the Capitol on 6 January 2021. Stefanik, meanwhile, has been furiously tweeting this morning, doubling down on her claims that Democrats are purposely manipulating immigration policy 'specifically for political and electoral purposes'.", "5877eddb03bb59144e49970b1a9b5ec4af34b464455c1994dc51fdb7": "", "d3502bf1ffb109db9699a407eec8fb75f5670a566007d722c94e6ea5": "", "cbba897f219639129ac36aac5a04950adc1e6a4e546180e1a8570379": "", "817c650e47b1fec707c1ad3c8eee7eda7f1bd0ca0082b2b048811fce": "", "6d46fc8420c22e3d27345485b64f914d7e52f74bcdd304eac390a04d": "Earlier today I set you the puzzles below, chosen by Irish mathematician Des MacHale, a prolific writer of joke and puzzle books. You can read some of his jokes here. The puzzles were a mixture of word, number and lateral thinking puzzles. They all give some 'haha' with the 'aha!'.  1. A rich woman dies and leaves her entire fortune of two million pounds between a number of lion tamers. How much did each lion tamer receive? Solution The nub of problem is grammar. The correct usage of 'between' and 'among' is that 'between' is for two people and 'among' is for more than two. So each lion-tamer got a million pounds. [Lion tamer is a red herring]. 2. Punctuate this sentence to reverse its meaning: A SMART DOG KNOWS ITS MASTER. Solution A SMART DOG KNOWS IT'S MASTER 3. What is never odd or even? Solution NEVER ODD OR EVEN is a palindrome, i.e. it reads the same back to front. 4. Make this equation correct just by moving the digits about: 26 = 74. Solution 72 = 49. You also needed to turn the 6 upside down! 5. Two objects perform the same task. One has many thousands of moving parts while the other has no moving parts. What are they? Solution One object is an hourglass; the other is a sundial. They both measure time. The moving parts of an hourglass are grains of sand. 6. Why did a person buy an object they didn't want for PS1 and throw it away a few minutes later? Solution They were shopping in a shop where if you spent PS50 you got a reduction of PS10. The bill came to PS49 so they bought a useless object for PS1. 7. Why did a man tighten the lids on all the jars in his house and put them in the fridge? Solution He had had a serious row with his wife and she wasn't talking to him. He knew this was one of the few tasks she could not do without his help. 8. In a locked cabin high up on the side of a mountain, five dead bodies are found. How had they all died? Solution The cabin is the cabin of a jet plane which had crashed into the mountain killing the five people. 9. Why was a person standing at a bus stop with an ordinary kitchen chair in their arms? Solution The person is a DIY enthusiast who is making a chair. They were using superglue and now the chair is stuck to their hands. They are waiting for a bus to take them to the hospital.

'Those in power who possess the ability to change the lives of more than 60,000 unhoused Angelenos must be willing to do so.' Heidi Marston's public comments about her decision to leave the Los Angeles homeless services authority (Lahsa) offer a rare look from an insider at the systemic problems that have prevented major metropolitan regions like LA from adopting the rapid, large-scale and humane response that the emergency demands. Marston's exit comes as Los Angeles is home to an estimated 66,000 unhoused people and accounts for 20% of all Americans living outside. More than five unhoused Angelenos are dying every day. Local residents are falling into homelessness faster than the unhoused are moving indoors. Large tent communities are growing on city streets and in parks.  The crisis in LA and in California has reached record proportions, but severe inequality is a growing problem in many US metropolitan regions. LA's broken system, experts say, mirrors the failures of cities across America to help their most vulnerable residents. Lahsa is the lead authority responsible for coordinating housing and services for unhoused people across LA county, the most populous county in the US.  Marston started at the agency in February 2019, having previously worked at the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Her tenure as director coincided with the pandemic, when homelessness in LA dramatically worsened, and residents voiced increasing frustration with encampments and the immense human suffering on the region's streets. Amid the crisis, Lahsa has faced its share of pressure, and of criticism. Marston herself has faced internal opposition over Lahsa's relationship with police and activists have been critical of the conditions of some temporary programs where the agency has placed unhoused people. But Marston has also pointed at deep and systemic issues impeding the region's response. LA leaders, she argued in a recent interview with the Guardian, have focused too much on removing visible signs of homelessness rather than getting people the housing they need and addressing the root causes of the crisis. During the pandemic, LA city officials have shut down large encampments that grew at major public sites, including at the Venice Beach boardwalk and MacArthur Park, while also passing a local ordinance restricting camping. But they have made little progress in tackling rising costs of living, low wages and racism and inequality in housing policies, Marston said, pointing at the need to construct new affordable housing, increase tenant protections and reduce restrictive zoning laws that prevent building. Before Covid, an estimated 600,000 LA renters were living on the edge, spending about 90% of their income on rent. As of April 2022, more than 300,000 households were estimated to be behind on rent. Meanwhile, rentals on the LA market have become largely unaffordable to the majority of Black, Latino and low-income residents. LA's encampment sweeps, which often escalate around major events like award shows and the Super Bowl, are another example of the region's flawed response, Marston said: 'Unhoused communities get pushed out further and are not offered real options. The tendency is to do quick fixes, which ultimately hurts the people who are already hurting.' Marston also pointed at governments' continued disinvestment in homelessness services, primarily relying on underfunded non-profit groups at a time when need is significantly growing. 'The model is ... 'We'll give you a little bit of money, we need you to solve the issue.'' LA, for example, pays non-profit providers $55 a night per shelter bed, when it now costs organizations closer to $90 to provide that service, Marston said. 'The gap between what non-profits have and what they need to truly operate is getting greater and greater, and unhoused people are paying the price,' she added. And she cited an internal conflict about the salaries of Lahsa workers, some of whom had been making wages considered 'very low income' by federal standards. Ninety-one per cent of the lowest-compensated workers were people of color. 'There is a fundamental gap between what we say we value and how we actually put that into practice,' she said, noting she had heard from employees who were themselves unhoused, living in crowded one-bedrooms or working multiple jobs to survive. 'There's a a lack of funding to do what is really necessary,' echoed Theo Henderson, an LA activist and podcast host who was previously unhoused. He has been critical of Marston and Lahsa's services but said: 'Politicians want to seem like they're offering solutions ... and they blame Lahsa because they believe Lahsa has a magic wand to solve houselessness. 'Everybody is losing - the unhoused, the taxpayers, and the people that really want to address houselessness and come up with solutions,' he said. Marston's resignation also underscored how homelessness policy in many American cities is controlled by elected officials whose main priorities aren't solving the crisis for the unhoused. In LA, the Lahsa director faces directives from 15 LA city councilmembers, the mayor, the elected county supervisors and an oversight board of political appointees. 'Our response in LA is driven by constituent complaints, by people who call their elected officials to complain about the encampment on the corner - not by the needs of the people who are unhoused,' Marston said. 'It's just moving the problem somewhere else.' She cited the anti-camping city law adopted last year that has allowed councilmembers to ban encampments from specific locations. The city claims it offers shelter to residents before evicting tent communities, but Marston, whose agency does the outreach, said the ordinance was counterproductive. 'We don't have enough resources to offer to people to go inside, and we're reaching a point of saturation,' she said. Case managers now regularly lose contact with unhoused people because they've been dispersed, she said; a spot will open up for someone on a waiting list who has gone missing. In March 2021, for example, one city councilmember pushed for a law enforcement shutdown of an encampment at Echo Park Lake, which displaced hundreds of people. The city promised housing for residents, but one year later, as the Guardian reported, Lahsa's data showed the vast majority of people evicted from the park were not in stable housing. It is important to balance different needs in public spaces, Marston said, but she argued that LA councilmembers were using the new ordinance 'as a weapon to move people from anywhere you don't want them'. Wealthier, whiter neighborhoods in the region tend to have more funding and land, yet they force the unhoused outside of their districts, she said: 'We're just building smaller and smaller fiefdoms and squeezing people out and creating greater inequities.' Of this year's local elections, she added: 'Candidates are running on fear, and running to appease housed constituents. The real change is going to come from people willing to do the right thing ... even at the cost of losing their seat.' Che Ramirez, deputy mayor for city homelessness initiatives, said in a statement that the mayor's office and councilmembers had 'worked collaboratively to ensure all people experiencing homelessness in areas impacted by [the anti-camping ordinance] are offered housing and services', and said the efforts at Venice Beach and MacArthur Park had been successful. Councilmember Bob Blumenfield, who supported the ordinance, said in a statement that 'humane laws ... are helping keep major public rights of way clear' and that he was working to create more housing. Mitch O'Farrell, the councilman for Echo Park, has brushed aside the findings about the lack of housing for people displaced from the encampment. A spokesperson said last week that his office had 'overseen the construction or approval of thousands of units of affordable housing, and we continue to have numerous successes where the work of our dedicated outreach teams results in housing or shelter'. Hilary Malson, a UCLA urban planning researcher, noted how unhoused people in LA have to learn which districts are safe for them to sleep outside in based on the political stances of different councilmembers. 'In election season, the narrative is: 'We can't have people camping all over the sidewalks. Where is the enforcement?' And my counterpoint is: where is the enforcement of tenant rights that prevent people from becoming unhoused? Where is the enforcement of human rights to prevent people from experiencing multiple displacements and violations?' LA will never solve the crisis while officials continue to focus on removing people from sight, she added. 'There is no political will to do the hard work of addressing systemic issues that cause homelessness ... There is more of a will to disappear the symptom of the problem of inequality.'", "f4893a0b9018b07af3d2052656d5fe5f00dc63a9422c3791d1b29cc8": "", "17dae59a0e39c2e517e67834184de97dbeb62bf9b516795a765a7173": "", "829fad82941927e7976547af9d1ed41cc63d559c93ece8258b84eb8e": "Digital investors have withdrawn savings in the 'stablecoin' tether worth $7.6bn (PS6.2bn) since the cryptocurrency crisis began last week, suggesting the company has paid out a sum almost twice its total cash holdings to spooked depositors. Stablecoins are supposed to have a fixed value matched to a real-world asset, in most cases $1 a token. However, faith in the concept was rocked last Tuesday when another big player, terra, broke its peg to the dollar. That has fuelled a wider sell-off across the crypto sector, which relies on stablecoins for much of its financial engineering. Tether, the third biggest cryptocurrency by 'market cap', experienced a short-lived crisis on Thursday when its value dropped from $1 to 95C/ as savers feared it would follow its fellow stablecoin terra and collapse. However, the token, which is controlled by a private company with close links to the crypto exchange Bitfinex, has since largely restored its dollar peg by honouring a promise to allow savers to always withdraw $1 for every tether they give back to the company. The company only allows direct withdrawals of at least $100,000 for each request, and charges a fee of 0.1% on redemptions. Anyone with less tether than that minimum can only turn their money into dollars by finding someone to buy it from them - a disparity that fuelled the temporary collapse in value. Despite the difficulties, according to public blockchain data, $7.6bn of tether has been reallocated in this way since Thursday. That is almost twice the cash that Tether had in its reserves at the end of last year, according to accounts published on its website. Most of the rest of its reserves are held in 'cash-like' assets, the majority of which are $35bn of US government debt and $25bn of corporate bonds. However, the company has refused to share any further details of the investments, with its chief technology officer, Paolo Ardoino, telling the Financial Times: 'We don't want to give our secret sauce.' There have long been fears as to Tether's ability to honour all redemptions. The company had once said it backed its currency with 'US dollars', a claim the New York attorney general said in 2021 'was a lie'. Now, it simply claims its currency is 'backed 100% by Tether's reserves'. By contrast, terra was backed by a complex algorithm that required the value of a sister cryptocurrency, luna, to constantly rise in order to maintain the dollar peg. When the crash hit last week, the system went into a 'death spiral', automatically printing more luna, which crashed the price further, until luna lost 99.9995% of its value in a matter of days and terra was left languishing at $0.11. The charismatic founder of the Terra project, Do Kwon, has said he wants to relaunch the currency. In a proposal posted to the project's message board on Friday, he suggested wiping all ownership of luna, and redistributing 1bn new tokens, with most going to those who hold the stablecoin, or who held luna before last week's crash. 'It is a hard balance - and no easy answers in redistributing value within the network,' Kwon wrote. 'But value must be distributed to allow the ecosystem to survive, and in its current state it will not.' Kwon also faces questions about how the vast sums of bitcoin that his project had amassed to back terra were spent. According to a breakdown shared by the organisation, it sold more than 80,000 bitcoins, worth more than $2.4bn, to unnamed parties in exchange for terra valued at $1 - at a time when the public price of the currency was under 75C/.  The jitters around stablecoins have combined with a general slump in tech stocks and the wider US downturn to trigger a wider crisis of confidence across the crypto sector. Bitcoin and ethereum, the two biggest cryptocurrencies, are down more than 10% over the last seven days, with ethereum dropping 17% to less than $2,000. Smaller currencies have, as always, been more volatile, with dogecoin falling 26% over the week. Even some of the most vocal backers of digital currencies are now querying the promises of the sector. The founder of the crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, said in an interview with the Financial Times that bitcoin has no future as a payments network because of the inherent inefficiencies of its blockchain, the public digital register that records its transactions. Instead, he argued, it could only function as a gold-like store of long-term value.", "7c98fa288a68ffd49f742beb8b1305ca2ba6ebe976fd00e5312ecde9": "Hungary has been accused of 'holding the EU hostage' over its refusal to agree an oil embargo against Russia, as the bloc struggles to reach consensus on its latest sanctions aimed at eroding the Kremlin's ability to wage war. Lithuania's foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said: 'Unfortunately the whole union is being held hostage by one member state.' He was referring to Hungary, which continues to block the oil embargo, despite being offered an extension on phasing out Russian crude until the end of 2024. 'Everybody expected this will be enough,' Landsbergis told reporters, reflecting the widespread view that Budapest would fall into line if it got more time to convert its energy system to accommodate non-Russian oil. The EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said there were no guarantees the issue would be resolved at a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday. 'We will do our best to unblock the situation,' he said. 'I cannot ensure this is going to happen because positions are quite strong.' Johanna Sumuvuori, Finland's junior foreign minister, who said she would update her counterparts on Helsinki's bid to join Nato, said on the oil ban: 'It's very important to do our utmost, so that we can make a strong statement as an EU.' The EU has been unable to agree to its sixth package of sanctions against Russia - which includes asset freezes and travel bans on prominent Vladimir Putin supporters - 12 days after the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, outlined plans for a Russian oil embargo to come into force at the end of 2022. Since the proposals, EU officials have made a series of concessions. A plan to ban EU ships from transporting Russian oil was dropped, after opposition from Greece and Cyprus, which worried their industries would lose out to competitors. Meanwhile, landlocked countries that are heavily dependent on Russian oil were offered a delay in joining the EU embargo. Hungary and Slovakia were given until the end of 2024, while the Czech Republic has been offered a June 2024 deadline. While Slovakia and the Czech Republic appear ready to sign off the sanctions, Budapest continues to hold out on the oil embargo, which the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, has likened to an atomic bomb hitting his country's economy. Hungary says it needs five years and hundreds of billions of forints to convert its Szazhalombatta refinery near Budapest, which can take only Russian oil. Hungarian officials also say Croatia must boost its capacity to ensure access to alternative supplies. Von der Leyen announced last week that she planned a video conference with Hungary and other countries in the region to work out how to rework Hungary's oil supply. No details have been announced since Von der Leyen made that statement. EU foreign ministers, who are meeting in Brussels for talks with Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, were never expected to produce a breakthrough on the sanctions hold-up. The 27 ministers are also meeting their Canadian counterpart, Melanie Joly, who called for Finland and Sweden's speedy accession to Nato. ", "4549136d502f8f733472d92724d79a19788bc24bf0e3738bd856bb6c": "A Greek helicopter pilot who claimed he killed his British wife, Caroline Crouch, 20, in a fit of anger after a row that had 'blurred' his senses, has been found guilty of murder at the end of a trial watched closely in Greece and abroad. The seven-member mixed tribunal of judges and jurors concluded unanimously that Babis Anagnostopoulos was culpable of premeditated murder, of deliberately killing the family's pet dog and of perverting the course of justice. The UK-trained aviator, who attempted to cover up his wife's murder as the result of a bungled break-in of their suburban Athens maisonette on 11 May last year - a fiction he maintained for nearly six weeks - was expressionless as the verdict was announced.  The tribunal ruled the 34-year old should receive the toughest penalty possible: a life sentence supplemented by a further jail term of eleven years and six months for the brutal killing of the dog. A fine of EUR21,000 (PS17,800) was also imposed. At the request of the defendant's lawyer the Athens court recessed to consider if mitigating circumstances, such as the good behaviour he has displayed in pre-trial detention in the high-security Korydallos prison, should be taken into account. But judges and jurors rejected the application. Earlier on Monday the public prosecutor, Eugenia Stathopoulou, said all the facts pointed to the murder being cold-blooded and planned. 'He was in a calm psychological state ... aware of his senseless brutality,' she said, before invoking a coroner's report to reject the defence's claim that Crouch had been awake at the time of her murder and that the crime had been provoked. 'The facts are self-evident ... and leave no doubt that he is responsible for the actions of which he has been accused.' It was only fair, she said, that the helicopter pilot - the son of a civil engineer and school teacher - be put behind bars for life, the toughest penalty that can be meted out for crimes of such magnitude in Greece. Anagnostopoulos, who met Crouch as a teenager on the island of Alonissos where she was raised, had argued the Briton was given to 'outbursts of anger', especially after giving birth to their daughter, Lydia. In an effort to make the crime appear more credible he killed his wife's adopted puppy and placed the 11-month-old child next to her dead mother's body. He then notified the police - allegedly making the emergency call with his nose - after binding his feet and hands with duct tape in a further attempt to make the robbery 'by a gang of foreign thieves' seem more realistic. 'His aim was to confuse authorities and he won 37 days [of freedom],' the prosecutor said, before the court's ruling. 'If there is one common trait to all his crimes, it is that the accused underestimated the intelligence of others.'  The tribunal unanimously rejected Anagnostopoulos's attempt to present the murder as a 'crime of passion' that might have resulted in a reduced penalty. Appealing for the maximum term possible before the verdict, Athanasios Haramis, the lawyer representing Crouch's retired oil executive father and Filipina mother, described Anagnostopoulos as 'a multitalented actor' who thought he had pulled off the 'perfect crime' for which he remained shamelessly unrepentant. 'Caroline has now become a symbol in the struggle [to combat] domestic violence against women,' said Haramis, describing the trial as 'historic' after the sentence was passed. 'It was a revolting crime ... the punishment is justified.' Greece has witnessed a surge in femicides whose violence has shocked the nation. Invariably, the murders have occurred as women have sought to end abusive relationships. In a diary, excerpts of which were read out in court, Crouch documented how her own marriage had become increasingly strained as the pilot sought to control her life. She was among 17 women in Greece to lose their lives at the hands of partners last year. Stathopoulou told the court it was indisputable that Anagnostopoulos had suffocated his wife with a pillow while lying on top of her during an unprovoked attack while she was asleep.", "67a348496443aa471fe8e58e96ee97118adf31d25d63bd5c76d34415": "Halyna Vasylivna lives alone in a tiny 'Khrushchevka' flat. At 94, she has outlived her sons and her husband, and her grandchildren live outside the city. Her apartment, named after the Soviet leader under whom the five-storey buildings in Kyiv's Podil district were built, is too far from the bunker so she hides in her pantry during airstrikes. Vasylivna is grateful for her social worker Olya's visits a few times a week. She wishes she did not live alone. 'It's important to have someone who can listen to you,' she says. Vasylivna is one of 2 million older women in Ukraine who have remained largely invisible to authorities. Most of Ukraine's elderly people are women - they make up two-thirds of those aged over 65 and 71% of those aged above 75 - partly because Ukraine has the sixth highest proportion of women in the world. These women are reliant on tiny state pensions (Vasylivna's is about PS130 a month), and require support from social services, charities and international institutions. They have become the group most likely to be alone, whether through mobility issues, bereavement or a reluctance to leave familiar surroundings. The lucky few get help; many do not. Ukraine's health and social care system was already under pressure before Russia invaded in February. Despite progress through reforms, including decentralisation that allowed regional institutions to allocate budgets locally, an overstretched and underfunded health system is again in crisis. Ukraine's expenditure on healthcare has declined from 7.8% of GDP in 2015 to 7.1% in 2019 (the last available data). The world average was 9.8% in 2019. Now the country is experiencing a humanitarian crisis, with dozens of accounts of rape and murder of Ukrainian elderly women - the biggest group left behind, of those allowed to leave, and least able to escape. In Kyiv's Holosiyevo district, there are 786 elderly people - 80% of them women like Vasylivna - alone, unable to leave their homes, and without relatives to care for them. Since Russia attacked, the number of social workers in the local centre has collapsed by more than 75%. Those women who remain are mostly elderly themselves, and now have four times as many clients to look after. They work five days a week, earning about PS170 a month to supplement their small state pensions. 'We need to support both our elderly clients and ourselves,' says 65-year-old social worker Nataliya Bodnar. Social centre manager, Oksana Ruban, says they have faced multiple challenges. 'Public transport was closed, the curfew lasted sometimes up to several days, shops closed, too. We had to make sure all of our clients were taken care of by someone - if not relatives or us, at least by neighbours or volunteers. We all worked relentlessly.' The situation for older people is particularly acute in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions where a survey of more than 1,500 over-60s conducted in March revealed the scale of the problem: 99% do not want to leave their homes; 91% need help to get food; 91% are also experiencing extreme cold, with no heating due to electricity cuts; 75% need basic hygiene items; and 34% need urgent medication for chronic illness. These needs are exacerbated by a shortage of vital medicines and Russia destroying healthcare facilities. 'I wonder why some young people evacuate their cats and hamsters, but leave their parents behind,' says Roman Vodyanyk, head doctor at Severodonetsk hospital in Luhansk, the only functioning hospital left in the city. With no water, gas or electricity in Severodonetsk, Vodyanyk has turned the hospital, which has more than 50 patients, into a humanitarian hub, providing hot food, wifi and medical support. About 220 patients have left in the past month, but many elderly people have no desire to evacuate, with nowhere to go and no one to care for them. 'How do you evacuate a hospital in this situation? How do you leave them all behind?' asks Vodyanyk. So despite the shelling and along with local authorities, NGOs and volunteers, he is not leaving either. Elderly people are often the forgotten category in any humanitarian crisis - an analysis of Google news search keywords between 24 February and 22 April found that 97% of all Ukraine-headlined articles focused on children. Only 3% mentioned elderly people, of which only three touched on elderly women. Despite there being more than 50% more retirees in Ukraine than children under 15, the 390 UK NGOs operating in Ukraine are nearly twice as likely to be helping children than elderly people, According to Justin Derbyshire, CEO of HelpAge International, the problem is global: elderly patients' specific needs are neglected by governments and international bodies during and after wars. 'This is systemic ageism and an example of how bad the global system is at responding to older people's needs.' Elderly people, such as Vasylivna and Bodnar, are at the centre of the crisis in Ukraine, as victims and rescuers. After a lifetime of looking after others, they are now vulnerable, not only to loneliness and hunger, but also to rape and murder. 'I've seen everything - the Holodomor [great famine of 1932-33], the second world war, so many horrors. What else could scare me?' says Vasylivna. She never imagined Russia would invade. It is her inability to take care of herself that scares her now. She feels trapped. 'I would evacuate if I could take care of myself. I was working my whole life. It's such a shame I can't do anything any more.'

As the Guardian reported last week, Pedin's feat was so extraordinary that at one of the 24 checkpoints he passed during his travels on the long journey, equivalent to trekking from London to Sheffield but through a raging war, Russian soldiers had gathered around him in the dark of the night to hear of his daring deeds, stuffing cigarettes in his pockets, and wishing him luck. But, while Pedin says he does not require medical assistance, insisting to medics when he arrived in Zaporizhzhia that he was 'happy as I am - alive', the former ship's cook says he is increasingly concerned for his loyal partner on their epic walk, Zhu-Zhu, his nine-year-old mongrel terrier. Now in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, Zhu-Zhu is still fearful of the whistle of a braking bus, reminiscent as it is of the bombs of Mariupol, and she sleeps long into the day. Her sense of smell, damaged by the acrid smoke of burning homes and tanks, is slowly returning, and she buries her nose into the grasses of Kyiv's parks with some apparent satisfaction. But Pedin says his dog's paws were badly cut up by the walk across smashed glass, cratered roads, and the rusty frame of a burned out and broken 30-metre-high bridge that the two had to traverse during their terrifying adventure. Zhu-Zhu walks with a limp now, and Pedin worries that his dog appears to be getting physically weaker by the day. He hopes to find a vet who will help, but with little money to his name, and relying on his parents, Georgy, 87, and Yevdokiya, 84, for the shelter that he has, Pedin admits it is for now only a hope. 'She is lame on the front right leg and she doesn't let me see what's wrong with her leg,' Pedin says of his dog. 'She always nips me when I want to look at her paw ... Zhu-Zhu now reacts very badly to sounds. When she hears sharp sounds, she constantly shudders and jumps aside. 'She is very frightened by the sound of whistling. For example, when a bus passes by and the brakes squeak. She is very afraid of that because this sound reminds her of the whistling of bombs that flew and exploded then in Mariupol. And then she was afraid of the sound of military planes in Mariupol. Who flew and dropped bombs. So she is still afraid of these sounds.' Pedin's tenderness towards his dog is evident. He caresses her ears, stroking off stray pieces of dry grass. The small dog, in turn, whimpers and cries when her owner is out of sight. Pedin had carried her up hills on their walk, remonstrating only once when Zhu-Zhu would not go any further. 'If you don't walk we will both die, you have to walk,' he had told his dog on one of the final days of their trek. 'On the third day of the walk, Zhu-Zhu was very tired,' he recalls. 'She periodically sat down, rested and often licked her sore paws.' The runt of a litter of 12 born in 2013, Pedin says his dog has been a loyal companion, giving him constant pleasure and love. He is determined to get the best care for her. 'I can't imagine my life without her,' he says. 'Before the evacuation, I promised her to bring her alive out of Mariupol and to get to our final destination. I told her in our house before we left, 'Just go and sing [like a marching soldier]', and she walked to the door. 'I promised she would be with me until the end, I promised.'", "c000d5102170d82bb6ee91be0a3ad72f02f8f66095d9993abc1a6bac": "Shanghai has set out plans for the return of more normal life from 1 June and the end of a painful Covid-19 lockdown that has lasted more than six weeks and contributed to a sharp slowdown in China's economic activity. In the clearest timetable yet, deputy mayor Zong Ming said on Monday that Shanghai's reopening would be carried out in stages, with movement curbs largely to remain in place until 21 May to prevent a rebound in infections, before a gradual easing. 'From June 1 to mid- and late June, as long as risks of a rebound in infections are controlled, we will fully implement epidemic prevention and control, normalise management and fully restore normal production and life in the city,' she said. The full lockdown of Shanghai and Covid curbs on hundreds of millions of consumers and workers in dozens of other cities have hurt retail sales, industrial production and employment, adding to fears the economy could shrink in the second quarter. The severe restrictions, increasingly out of step with the rest of the world, which has been lifting Covid rules even as infections spread, are also sending shockwaves through global supply chains and international trade. Data on Monday showed China's industrial output fell 2.9% in April from a year earlier, down sharply from a 5.0% increase in March, while retail sales shrank 11.1% year-on-year after falling 3.5% the month before. Both were well below expectations. Economic activity has probably been improving somewhat in May, analysts say, and the government and central bank are expected to deploy more stimulus measures to speed things up. But the strength of the rebound is uncertain due to China's uncompromising 'zero Covid' policy of eradicating all outbreaks at all costs. 'China's economy could see a more meaningful recovery in the second half, barring a Shanghai-like lockdown in another major city,' said Tommy Wu, the lead China economist at Oxford Economics. 'The risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, as the effectiveness of policy stimulus will largely depend on the scale of future Covid outbreaks and lockdowns.' Beijing, which has been finding dozens of new cases almost every day since 22 April, offers a strong indication of how difficult it is to tackle the highly transmissible Omicron variant. The capital has not enforced a city-wide lockdown but has been tightening curbs to the point that road traffic levels in Beijing slid last week to levels comparable to Shanghai's, according to GPS data tracked by Chinese internet giant Baidu. On Sunday, Beijing extended guidance to work from home in four districts. It had already banned dine-in services at restaurants and curtailed public transport, among other measures. In Shanghai, the deputy mayor said the city would begin to reopen supermarkets, convenience stores and pharmacies from Monday, but that many movement restrictions had to remain in place until at least 21 May. It not clear how many businesses have reopened. From Monday, China's railway operator would gradually increase the number of trains arriving and departing from the city, Zong said. Airlines would also increase domestic flights. From 22 May, bus and rail transit would also gradually resume operations, but people would have to show a negative Covid test not older than 48 hours to take public transport. During the lockdown, many Shanghai residents have been disappointed time and again by shifting schedules for the lifting of restrictions. Many residential compounds got notices last week that they would be in 'silent mode' for three days, which typically means not being able to leave the house and, in some cases, no deliveries. Another notice then said the silent period would be extended to 20 May. 'Please don't be lying to us this time,' one member of the public said on the Weibo social media platform, adding a crying emoji. Shanghai reported fewer than 1,000 new cases for 15 May, all inside areas under the strictest controls. In relatively freer areas - the ones monitored to gauge progress in eradicating the outbreak - no new cases were found for a second day in a row. A third day would usually mean 'zero Covid' status has been achieved and restrictions can begin to ease. Fifteen of the city's 16 districts had reached zero Covid. Beijing reported 54 new cases, up from 41.", "51055f72f3a5692042214141fbc68ae52836068d8d00c8cd2a16379c": "Boris Johnson is poised to give the green light to controversial legislation on the Northern Ireland protocol this week as he flies to Belfast for crunch meetings, gambling that the move will restart stalled talks. The prime minister warned that it was a 'necessity to act' if negotiations with the EU did not resume and said new measures would be put to parliament in the coming days. It comes as it emerged that business leaders in Northern Ireland have urged Johnson not to take any unilateral action in a private letter to Downing Street. A source confirmed that the letter from the Northern Ireland business Brexit working group, an umbrella organisation of 14 business bodies, told the prime minister there was the prospect of a deal with the EU. 'It was being suggested that action was needed because business groups asked for it and trade was suffering because of the protocol. We asked them specifically not to launch unilateral action. We do not need the nuclear option when we believe there is still a prospect of a deal,' said the source. They said that it was astonishing that Johnson was flying to Northern Ireland threatening unilateral action and not meeting the group, despite their pleas, adding that the government had shown scant interest in business - with one 15-minute Zoom call with Liz Truss in January and no engagement since. The business groups say they are perplexed by statements from government listing issues that have already been resolved or which are close to being resolved. Amid frayed relations between the prime minister and Truss, Johnson will emphasise the need for restrained language to his foreign secretary. However, he is still set to sign off her preferred tactic for new legislation which would override parts of the protocol to remove checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. Truss has prepared a bill giving the government the right to suspend elements of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland, a move which the EU has warned could spark a trade war. Measures in the bill are expected to include a new 'green lane' for goods for sale only in Northern Ireland and stronger penalties for those smuggling into the EU via the Republic. Ahead of crunch talks with parties at Stormont, Johnson said the circumstances had fundamentally changed since the deal was signed. 'It was designed in the absence of a trade and cooperation agreement and when it was unclear one would be agreed. It has not been adapted to reflect the realities of the TCA. 'It was designed before a global pandemic and a European war which has created a cost of living crisis on a scale not seen for half a century.' Johnson said in the op-ed for the Belfast Telegraph that there could not 'even be a question' about the fast availability of medicines in Northern Ireland nor was it fair that the chancellor could not grant people in Northern Ireland the same tax and VAT benefits.' He said negotiations remained at an impasse while the EU claimed it was 'impossible to make the changes to the protocol text to actually solve these problems in negotiations - because there is no mandate to do so.'  One official said they expected the time frame for the new legislation to be decelerated to allow diplomatic efforts to resume. Another Whitehall official acknowledged the legislation was 'several weeks away' from being formally put to MPs. Dozens of Conservative MPs have suggested they would vote against a bill in its later stages. A Whitehall source said they acknowledged the internal briefing war of the past week, which included cabinet splits and threw the internal choreography in crisis, had been unhelpful with a decades-old peace process at stake. 'The priority tomorrow is to calm things down,' they said. The source suggested Johnson would tell Truss to handle things more delicately. Sources close to Truss have denied her team leaked details of the planned legislation and say they have not been responsible for some of the more inflammatory rhetoric - which they claim has irritated the foreign secretary. 'The ideal solution is that we work through the problems with the protocol with the EU and through a negotiated solution and get the executive back up and running,' a government source said. 'If they are not willing to show flexibility it's our responsibility as a government to look at other options. [Truss] does favour looking at legislation as a way of doing that. But there is a difference between giving ourselves the powers to do something and then actually doing something.' No 10 said it was Johnson's priority to restore the conditions for negotiations - claiming he had a 'conciliatory' call with Ireland's taoiseach last week. However, the Irish Times on Saturday reported sources describing it as 'the single worst call he [Martin] has ever had with anyone'. Johnson is expected to meet the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein in Belfast on Monday. The DUP blocked the election of a speaker at Stormont on Friday, meaning the assembly is unable to function after the elections where Sinn Fein became the largest party. Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O'Neill who is first minister designate, said she would warn Johnson that any unilateral action to walk away from the protocol would be 'reckless' and 'deepen political instability'. 'Any threat of unilateral action by the British government to denounce the withdrawal agreement, or disapply the protocol would be reckless. Walking away from international obligations would also represent an appalling attack on the international rule of law,' she said. 'Only through joint agreement with the EU can solutions to problems or concerns be resolved. I will be telling Boris Johnson that unilateral action deepens political instability and economic uncertainty and must not happen.' On Sunday the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said the UK had 'the right to act in a sovereign way' and to 'reopen or re-examine the protocol' but he denied the actions would constitute a breach of international law. Johnson has previously vowed not to scrap the protocol and said he is only seeking reform that has 'the broadest possible cross-community support'. Simon Coveney, Ireland's foreign minister, 'criticised sabre-rattling and grandstanding' from ministers over the past week. Johnson has already been told that dozens of Conservative MPs would attempt to stop the bill from becoming law if it reaches the later stages - though many see it as a negotiating tactic. Coveney said the behaviour of UK ministers was 'creating a lot of tension in my country, your closest neighbour, and also potentially being on the verge of making a decision that could fundamentally undermine the functioning of the institutions of the peace process in Northern Ireland'. He told Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News that the relations between Britain and Ireland were being fundamentally damaged because of 'unhelpful briefings that we're getting from very, very senior levels within the British government this week'. Coveney said the EU had not threatened any specific retaliation - though several European parliamentarians have said there will be consequences, including the potential suspension of the trade deal, should the UK government act unilaterally. 'There's no way the EU can compromise if the UK is threatening unilateral action to pass domestic legislation to set aside international obligations under an international treaty that, don't forget, the UK was the primary designer of along with the EU,' he said.", "cac89d74d4461e9dae1433f2b40b528ff38fe1dda8dd942a7f1d45b1": "Wayne Rooney will this week give evidence in his wife's 'Wagatha Christie' libel trial, as the multimillion-pound case at the centre of a media circus enters its final days at the high court in London. England's record goalscorer has sat in court next to his wife, Coleen Rooney, throughout but until now has remained stoically silent and impassively staring into space. The football manager did not react as he listened to his wife tell the court about difficulties in their marriage or the impact that tabloid intrusion had had on their personal lives over the last 20 years. Rooney has been called as a witness for his wife's defence and is likely to be asked about an alleged exchange with his then England teammate, Jamie Vardy, about Rebekah Vardy's dealings with the media. Coleen Rooney's witness statement claims that when her husband was captain of the England football team at Euro 2016, he warned Jamie that his wife's decision to write a column for the Sun during the tournament 'was causing a distraction to the touring party'. Rebekah Vardy denies this was the case. Coleen has previously said that Wayne was completely unaware she was conducting a supposed sting operation to find out who was leaking stories from her private Instagram account to the Sun. In 2019 she publicly alleged the source of the leaks was Rebekah Vardy's Instagram account, prompting Vardy to sue for libel. While Jamie Vardy has stayed away from the court - instead training and scoring goals for Leicester City - Wayne Rooney has been ever-present at his wife's side, sitting on the front row of the courtroom and helping to carry designer bags into court. During one break in proceedings, he stood outside the courtroom cheerily chatting with a man in a Liverpool FC shirt attending a different trial, while at another he held the door open for lawyers and journalists as they left court. The Derby County manager has also had to deal with jibes about his financially stricken football club. At one point Hugh Tomlinson QC, Vardy's barrister, asked Coleen Rooney whether she had any hard evidence that Vardy was the leaker - rather than simply a strong belief. He posed the question: 'You might believe Derby County might win the Premiership in two years' time. It's not evidence is it?' Rooney did not flinch at all when he heard the comment. It would be impossible for Derby County to win the top division of English football within two years because they have just been relegated to the third tier. The trial will resume on Monday morning with Coleen Rooney continuing to be cross-examined. Under English libel law it is up to Rooney to prove her original accusation that Vardy was the individual leaking stories about her family to the Sun. By Rooney's own admission her case against Vardy is based on circumstantial evidence. Vardy's team insist the reason there is no smoking gun is because Vardy was not involved in leaking the stories in question. Rooney's lawyers have argued that the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming and key material that could prove their client's case has been deliberately destroyed or mislaid. While Vardy only called one witness - herself - Rooney's defence team have called a number of PR advisers, agents and former Football Association staff to give evidence. The trial is scheduled to finish on Wednesday after seven days of public court hearings. There is no jury in the case and high court judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, who has been overseeing proceedings, will then hand down a judgment at a later date. The trial continues.", "895a17364b0c3d353e383865aa2d060d95f18f6d924d0ae4d2d8d5fd": "A man opened fire during a lunch reception at a southern California church, killing one person and wounding five senior citizens before a pastor hit the gunman on the head with a chair and parishioners tied him up with electrical cords. Jerry Chen had just stepped into the kitchen of his church's fellowship hall at about 1.30pm on Sunday when he heard gunshots. Chen, 72, a longtime congregant at Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian church in Laguna Woods, saw church members screaming, running and ducking under tables. 'I knew someone was shooting,' he said. 'I was very, very scared. I ran out the kitchen door to call 911.' Officials said the shooting ended after the gunman killed one man and wounded five senior citizens before worshippers hog-tied his legs with an electrical cord until deputies arrived. Four of the five people wounded suffered critical gunshot injuries. While a motive for the shooting at the Geneva Presbyterian church in the city of Laguna Woods was not immediately disclosed, investigators do not believe the gunman - an Asian man in his 60s whose name was not immediately released lives in the community. Chen, who called 911 from the church's parking lot, said he was in such a state of shock that he was unable to tell the operator his location. 'I had to ask someone else for the address,' he said. Chen said a group of about 40 congregants had gathered in the fellowship hall for a luncheon after a morning service to welcome their former pastor Billy Chang. 'Everyone had just finished lunch,' he said. 'They were taking photos with Pastor Chang. I had just finished my lunch and went into the kitchen.' He then heard the gunshots and ran out. Soon afterwards, Chen said, he heard the details of what happened inside from others who came out. Fellow congregants told Chen that when the gunman stopped to reload, Pastor Chang hit him on the head with a chair while others moved quickly to grab his gun. They then subdued him and tied him up, Chen said. 'It was amazing how brave [Chang] and the others were,' he said. 'This is just so sad. I never, ever thought something like this would happen in my church, in my community.' Most of the church's members were elderly, highly educated Taiwanese immigrants, Chen said. 'We're mostly retirees and the average age of our church is 80,' he said. Orange County undersheriff Jeff Hallock praised the parishioners' quick work to detain the gunman. 'That group of churchgoers displayed what we believe is exceptional heroism and bravery in intervening to stop the suspect. They undoubtedly prevented additional injuries and fatalities,' Hallock said. 'I think it's safe to say that had people not intervened, it could have been much worse.' The shooting came a day after an 18-year-old man shot and killed 10 people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York. The investigation was in its early stages, Hallock said. He said the many unanswered questions include whether the assailant attended the church service, if he was known to church members and how many shots were fired. The majority of those inside the church at the time were believed to be of Taiwanese descent, said Carrie Braun, a sheriff's spokesperson. Those wounded by gunshots included four Asian men, ages 66, 75, 82 and 92, and an 86-year-old Asian woman, the sheriff's department said. Authorities originally said only four of the five surviving victims had been shot. Officials did not immediately disclose any information about the alleged gunman. The deadliest shooting inside a church in the US occurred in 2017 in Sutherland Springs, Texas, when a gunman opened fire during a Sunday service at First Baptist church and killed more than two dozen people. In 2015, Dylann Roof fired dozens of bullets during the closing prayer of a 2015 Bible study session at Charleston's Mother Emanuel AME church in South Carolina. Nine members of the Black congregation were killed in the racist violence and Roof became the first person in the US sentenced to death for a federal hate crime. His appeal remains before the supreme court.", "8f589be48b8b4294ca3d68bd11310c5cff9afa8213e4bdcac41b7ee5": "New Zealand will help some people to buy electric vehicles, end its reliance on fossil fuels, lower agricultural emissions, and reduce waste going to landfill, the government has promised in the most significant announcement on climate change action in the country's history. The emissions reduction plan sets the direction for climate action for the next 15 years, with a cap on the amount of greenhouse gas New Zealand can emit, in order to meet targets to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The government announced the details of New Zealand's first comprehensive plan to slash climate emissions and how it will be funded at parliament on Monday. The plan last week garnered near cross-party support, which will give it enduring influence if there is a change in government. Two minor parties did not support the plan - the rightwing ACT party, which said it is not necessary, while Te Pati Maori (the Maori Party) said it does not go far enough. The finance minister, Grant Robertson, has revealed how the 'climate emergency response fund' - generated from emissions trading and ringfenced for climate spending - will be allocated, ahead of the primary budget announcement on Thursday. 'This is a landmark day in our transition to a low emissions future,' Jacinda Ardern said in a statement. The day will be bittersweet for the prime minister, who has called climate change this generation's 'nuclear-free moment' and long campaigned on the promise to slash emissions, but was unable to attend the announcement due to testing positive for Covid-19 and needing to isolate at home. 'The emissions reduction plan delivers the greatest opportunity we've had in decades to address climate change,' Ardern said. 'We can't opt out of the effects of climate change so we can't opt out of taking action.' The minister of climate change, James Shaw, said the plan would lay the path towards a net zero future where more people could buy electric vehicles, towns and cities would have better transport infrastructure, the highest emitters would switch to clean energy, farmers would grow food in a way that helps the climate, and warmer, more affordable heating options for homes would exist. It would ensure an equitable transition for Maori, through developing a Maori action plan and through funding and resources for Maori-led programmes and solutions. 'This is a historic day for climate action in Aotearoa,' Shaw said. 'Because of this work, New Zealand is on track to bend the curve of its emissions downwards for the first time in its history.' One of the most significant initiatives is the clean car upgrade programme, which will support lower and middle income families to transition to low-emission alternatives through a 'scrap and replace' trial. That will allow eligible families to trade in their vehicles and receive support to buy electric or hybrid vehicles, which will in turn be cheaper to run. This, and plans to improve public transport through greener bus fleets, better cycleways and walkways, and more frequent trains, will put the country on track to make zero-emissions vehicles 30% of the light vehicle fleet (cars, vans and utes) and reduce the total kilometres light vehicles travel by to 20% by 2035, the government says. More than $1.2bn had been allocated towards this part of the plan, which was expected to reduce emissions equivalent to taking 181,000 cars off the road between now and 2035, said Michael Wood, the minister of transport. The climate fund was established using an initial $4.5bn from the emissions trading scheme - which charges certain businesses for the greenhouse gases they emit - and meant 'the polluters are paying [for pollution], not households', Robertson said. A portion of that fund - $1.3bn - has been earmarked for international climate aid, with half committed to the Pacific. Another $1.5bn will be allocated in future budgets. Further spending announcements will be made as part of the overall 2022 budget announcement on Thursday. On Monday, Robertson announced the first tranche of funding allocations. One of the largest investments, at just over $650m over four years, will go towards decarbonising industry and speeding up the switch to cleaner energy options. Megan Woods, the minister of energy and resources, said: 'Rising global energy prices we cannot control show we must wean ourselves off expensive fossil fuels.' Emissions from the energy and industry sectors made up 27% of New Zealand's total emissions, she added. Agricultural emissions are being largely dealt with in a separate policy called He Waka Eke Noa - a five-year programme working with the sector to reduce methane and build resilience. But the government has committed more than $700m over four years to lower agricultural emissions, expand the contribution of forestry to reduce carbon, and produce alternative 'green' fuels. This will be paid for by the emissions trading scheme, despite the agriculture sector being exempt from having to pay into it until 2025. Central to this is the establishment of the new centre for climate action on agricultural emissions, which will drive innovation and product development. New Zealand has long relied on its 'clean green' image for tourism, trade and wider global cultural cache, and has regularly made headlines for some of its grander gestures, including when Ardern declared a climate emergency. But the country's green reputation has become more untenable in recent years. The country's gross emissions per person are high and it is one of the world's worst performers on emissions increases. Emissions in New Zealand rose by 57% between 1990 and 2018 - the second-greatest increase of all industrialised countries. 'New Zealand trades on its environmental reputation - it is the key to the ongoing security of our primary exports and tourism, our two main export earners,' Robertson said, adding that investing in low-emissions projects and industries would protect those industries. 'These [overall] plans mark the greatest transformation for the economy and New Zealand society in my time in politics.' The chair of the climate change commission, Rod Carr, told Newsroom the plan was a good step, but said the car scraping scheme would need to be carefully designed. 'The evidence overseas as I understand it is that scrappage schemes as implemented overseas have been relatively expensive ways of reducing emissions. But that depends entirely on how they're targeted and who gets the benefit and what the benefit is used for.' The University of Otago's Prof Lisa Ellis, who is also a member of He Kaupapa Hononga/Otago's Climate Change Research Network, told the Science Media Centre: 'The good news ... is that we finally have the legal and political infrastructure to drive the transition to a sustainable and equitable low-emissions economy.' The bad news, Ellis added, was that the emissions budgets were weak. 'As a country with one of the world's highest per capita emissions, we have a responsibility to do our fair share by taking prompt action to prevent runaway climate change.'", "71e27e22ccfd0efc58de3713163fd8615d370dbda8050c2236b5dac2": "Sea sponges off New Zealand's southern coastline have been found bleached bone-white for the first time, following extreme ocean temperatures. A group of scientists from Victoria University of Wellington were alarmed to discover the sponges, which are typically a rich chocolate brown, were bleached in more than a dozen sites near Breaksea Sound and Doubtful Sound in Fiordland. The university's marine biology professor James Bell said in some parts as many as 95% of the sponges were bleached. 'Our initial estimates are there are at least hundreds of thousands of sponges likely to have been bleached and maybe even many more than that,' he said. Bell's team discovered the mass bleaching during a research trip in April. The species, which is common to the lower South Island, is one of 800 species of sponge found in New Zealand. Sponge gardens dominate the sea floor around the country and hold an important role in creating habitats for fish and releasing carbon that other species feed off. There have been reports of sponges bleaching, including off the coast of Tasmania earlier this year, but typically they tend to be more tolerant to oceanic changes compared with other species such as corals, Bell said. 'It's a really unusual event,' he said.  'This just highlights the kind of climate crisis that we're facing. There are so many species around New Zealand and we don't know what their thermal tolerances are.' Last year, the world's oceans were the hottest in recorded history, due to climate change, which among other things can cause the oceans to acidify and degrade reefs and ecosystems. New Zealand was no exception, with 2021 its hottest year on record. Temperatures in April were still unseasonably high, with coastal water temperatures up to 2.6 degrees above average, according to the National Institute for Water and Atmospherics.  In Fiordland, those temperatures were even higher, said Rob Smith, a University of Otago oceanographer, who works with the government-funded Moana Project researching marine heatwaves. He told RNZ the region recorded temperatures up to 5 degrees higher than usual. 'What we've seen this summer is the strongest marine heatwave on the west coast of the South Island in 40 years.' Further research was needed to establish definitively whether ocean temperatures are causing the bleaching, Bell said. At this stage the researchers had an observation and a 'very strong correlation' between the bleaching and a severe temperature spike. Some bleached sponges could come back to life, Bell said, but the team would need to return to the site to see how they were faring towards the end of the month. 'There is some hope they may not die, but unfortunately some of them are a little bit manky and not very happy or healthy.'", "d97dc517727bbb861ccb6af4d4cf1bd6448defa65dc401b82f6f9e7b": "A man has been airlifted to hospital after wrestling himself free from a crocodile that latched on to his arm at a waterfall in remote north-west Queensland. The RACQ LifeFlight Rescue helicopter flew the man from Lawn Hill national park to a Mount Isa hospital where he remains in a stable condition with puncture wounds to his arm, hands and leg. The man, aged in his 40s, was on a motorcycle tour of the park and had been swimming in the gorge at Adel's Grove on Sunday. He told rescue crews he had wrestled with the freshwater crocodile before managing to escape. An aircrew officer, Greig Allan, said the man was in a lot of pain and the bite wounds were deep. 'The patient told us the crocodile would have been between two and three metres long, so he's lucky to have escaped with his life,' Allan said. The rescue helicopter was called to the area about 2pm before members of the motorcycle crew drove the man to a nearby airstrip.

The House speaker railed against conservative judges appointed by former president Donald Trump in an interview Sunday on CNN's State of the Union, in which she urged Democrats to keep their 'eye on the ball' to protect other freedoms she sees under threat. 'Beware in terms of marriage equality, beware in terms of other aspects,' she said. 'Understand this. This is not just about terminating a pregnancy. This is about contraception, family planning. 'This is a place where freedom and the kitchen table, issues of America's families, come together. What are the decisions that a family makes? What about contraception for young people? It's beyond just a particular situation. It's massive in terms of contraception, in vitro fertilization, a woman's right to decide.' Speaking the day after hundreds of protest events took place nationwide, Pelosi insisted Democrats had done what they could in terms of protecting abortion rights through legislation. She pointed out the House had passed a bill before the women's health protection act failed in the Senate on Wednesday, and she said she was still optimistic of a resolution with the support of pro-choice Republicans. But she said the 60-vote requirement in the Senate was 'an obstacle to many good things', and that Democrats needed to rally ahead of November's midterm elections to 'get rid of the damage' caused by conservative justices, including Trump's three appointments, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. 'Whoever suspected a creature like Donald Trump would become president, waving a list of judges he would appoint, therefore getting the support of the far right and appointing those anti-freedom justices to the court?' she said. 'This is not about a long game. We played a long game, we won Roe v Wade a long time ago, we voted to protect it over time. Let's not take our eye off the ball. The ball is this court, which is dangerous to families, to freedoms in our country. 'The genius of our founders was to have a constitution that enabled freedom to expand. This is the first time the court has taken back a freedom that was defined by precedent and respect for privacy.' Independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, on NBC's Meet the Press, said he remained hopeful that abortion rights legislation could be resurrected before the midterms. 'Nobody should think this process is dead. We should bring those bills up again, and again and again,' he said. 'People cannot believe you have a supreme court and Republicans who are prepared to overturn 50 years of precedent. What we should do is on this bill end the filibuster, do everything that we can to get 50 votes on the strongest possible bill to protect a woman's right to control her own body.' An NBC News poll conducted after the leak of a draft opinion and reported by the network Sunday showed six out of 10 voters were in favor of abortion rights, and that 52% of voters were 'less likely' to support a candidate who backed the supreme court's draft ruling. But the poll found that inflation and the economy remained the biggest concerns for voters as the midterms approach.", "1ac7dd9a11fb14d6ea46586f347235b08446d2595341566692afc1c9": "Switzerland has voted to boost the availability of transplant organs by making everyone a potential donor after death unless they have expressly objected. The legal change was approved by 60% of voters in a referendum. Under the existing laws, transplants are only possible if the deceased person consented while alive. Their wishes are often unknown, and in such cases the decision is left up to relatives who in most cases opt against organ donation. At the end of 2021, more than 1,400 patients were awaiting transplant organs in Switzerland, a country of about 8.6 million people. Last year, 166 deceased persons donated their organs in Switzerland, and a total of 484 such organs were transplanted. But 72 people died in 2021 while waiting on an organ transplant waiting list, according to the organisation Swisstransplant. 'The public have shown that they are ready to give a chance to the people who are on the waiting list,' said Swisstransplant's director, Franz Immer. In a bid to reduce the backlog, the government and parliament wanted to change the law to a 'presumed consent' model, something already adopted in a number of other European countries. According to that system, people who do not wish to become an organ donor after death must explicitly say so. Those who have not made their wishes clear would be assumed to be in favour. However, relatives would still be able to refuse if they know or suspect that the person concerned would have chosen not to donate an organ. In cases where no relatives can be contacted, no organs may be removed. The rules would only apply to people aged 16 and over. The medical conditions for donation remain the same: only people who die in a hospital intensive care unit can donate their organs, and two doctors must confirm the death.", "26d8f3aa8a388b045bc156b8bc41ae72368789e9f4c68b5b5966eb36": "The exceptional heatwave conditions across parts of India and Pakistan over the past few weeks have been in the news - although the region has in fact endured extreme heat since March. Through the next few days, although nowhere near as extreme as in India and Pakistan, anomalous warmth will be affecting large portions of western Europe in the first significant heat of spring. Throughout April, large parts of Europe experienced below-normal temperature trends, with winds often emanating from a north-easterly direction. However, over the past week or so, weather patterns have rearranged to encourage more of a south or south-westerly feed of air across Europe, and temperatures have been picking up as a result. Through the coming week, as a southerly flow continues, temperatures across much of western Europe will increase further, such that maximum daily temperatures relative to average will be among some of the highest in the world at this time. Through much of Spain and France, daytime highs are likely to rise into the mid-30s celsius this week, representing anomalies in excess of 10C above normal. Later this week and into the weekend, it looks likely that parts of Iberia and northern Africa will become even hotter still, with some forecast models hinting that maximum daytime temperatures may break 40C in parts of central and southern Spain. While not record-breaking at this stage, these would still represent temperatures about 10 to 12 degrees above the seasonal norm. The heat has already been generating thunderstorm activity, some of which has spilled northwards into the UK at times. Meanwhile across the other side of the globe, devastating floods have continued to affect parts of Queensland in Australia, forcing people from their homes. While the heavy rains responsible for the flooding have eased over the past week, river levels have continued to rise, peaking in the last few days. It looks likely that south-easterly winds will drive in more unwelcome rain to coastal Queensland later this week, with totals exceeding 100mph possible by the end of this weekend. It is also looking windy and extremely wet across north-western portions of western Australia too this week, with 100 to 150mm of rain expected in the next few days, leading to a flood risk in these areas.", "96f278001bd7362bf3282644fc4525bd355441ab0bb24c45d724701c": "", "82fe5530724cb5483f4d06be1d98266137e82d5a9590d428dc132777": "The expansion of an iron ore mine in the Arctic that would have increased shipping and led to the 'complete extirpation of narwhal' from the region has been blocked. After four years of consultations and deliberations, the Nunavut Impact Review Board rejected a request from Baffinland Iron Mines Corp asking to significantly increase mining on the northern tip of Baffin Island in Nunavut, Canada. The area is home to one of the world's richest iron ore deposits, and the densest narwhal population in the world. The news came as a surprise and a relief to conservationists and community members working to protect the narwhal population and the Inuit who rely on them for subsistence. 'I actually cried,' said Chris Debicki, a vice-president and counsel at the conservation organisation Oceans North. 'The case against expansion at this moment was too strong and community opposition was too loud.' The review board issued a statement on Friday saying that the Mary River mine expansion project carried potential for 'significant and lasting negative effects on marine mammals, the marine environment, fish, caribou and other terrestrial wildlife, vegetation and freshwater'. 'In the Board's view, these negative effects could also impact Inuit harvesting, culture, land use and food security,' it said. Dan Vandal, Canada's northern affairs minister, can now decide whether to side with the review board or with Baffinland. He is expected to make his decision within the next three months. Baffinland's CEO, Brian Penney, said in a brief online statement that the company was 'surprised and disappointed' in the review board's report and recommendations, and that he urged 'the federal government to consider all of the evidence and input and to approve the Phase 2 application with fair and reasonable conditions'. Baffinland is jointly owned by ArcelorMittal and the Houston private equity firm the Energy and Minerals Group. Its expansion bid sought to increase shipping from the current 6m tonnes of iron ore a year to 12m from its north Baffin Island port at Milne Inlet. It also wanted to build a second railway to another port, from which it intended to ship an additional 18m tonnes. Current shipping volumes have already had a 'devastating' impact on the narwhal population, said Enookie Inuarak, vice-chairperson of the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization. Narwhals are a type of whale recognisable by the long, spear-like tusk that protrudes from its head. The animal is an important predator in Eclipse Sound and other Arctic waters, as well a major food source for Inuit in the region. Inuarak said generations of hunters have relied on narwhal hunting in the summer, when thousands of narwhal typically come to Eclipse Sound. Because narwhal meat is rich in vitamin C, it helps keep community members healthy during the round-the-clock darkness of winter. Last summer, hunters found barely any narwhals. 'We rely on narwhals for diet, for health and also economically,' Inuarak said, adding that their growing absence from the region 'means less of everything'. Since Baffinland began mining operations at Mary River in 2015, the number of narwhal has precipitously declined, according to Arctic marine biologist Kristin Westdal. 'If you look at the surveys [since 2014], you see this incredible, statistically significant decline in the narwhal population in this area - we see 12,000, 10,000, 5,000, 2,000,' Westdal said. Because narwhals use underwater echolocation to communicate with each other, the noise and interference from mining transport ships is forcing them out of the area. Inuarak said Friday's ruling would lead to celebrations in Pond Inlet, a community near the mine, including a small parade, but he said the threat remains. The final decision on the future of the mine's operations rests with the federal government. Many supporters wanted the expansion because it came with promises of royalties and jobs. But Debicki said the review board's rejection was significant. 'This iron ore deposit is one of the best in the world because of its high concentration,' he said. 'The reality is that there'll be mining in this region not for tens of years, but likely for hundreds of years, so it's super important to get the development right at the outset.'", "07caed0bdfa4a3f8e213b62733a343fa1db17500d68115758a0265ed": "The Queen was honoured with a standing ovation as her platinum jubilee celebrations kicked off with a star-studded equestrian extravaganza featuring some of the world's leading performers. Hollywood actors Tom Cruise and Dame Helen Mirren - once again playing a queen of England - led the cast of entertainers who appeared in the first major event marking the Queen's 70-year reign. The audience rose to their feet applauding and cheering when the monarch arrived at the arena close to Windsor Castle for the musical and theatrical romp across the centuries called A Gallop Through History. The event was staged by the Royal Windsor Horse Show, which has been welcoming spectators for the past three days including the Queen, who spent part of Friday touring the showgrounds after earlier missing the state opening of parliament. Despite ongoing mobility issues, the Queen walked to her seat in the royal box after she was driven into the castle arena escorted by mounted divisions of the Household Cavalry. She was joined by the Earl and Countess of Wessex for the show that reflected her lifelong passion for horses. A tri-service guard of honour featuring the Coldstream Guards, RAF Regiment and Royal Navy was in place for her arrival, which was signalled by the national anthem being played by military musicians. Among the celebrities taking part in the show were Damian Lewis, Omid Djalili and Katherine Jenkins, in an all-star cast of British and international talent for Sunday's performance which was broadcast live by ITV.  Cruise, best known for action film franchises Top Gun and Mission Impossible, told ITV presenters Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham that the Queen 'is a woman I greatly admire'. Cruise said: 'What she has accomplished is historic. She has met presidents, world leaders, people from all walks of life. 'Not just Americans but the world knows the dignity, devotion and kindness, that is what I have always felt about her. Someone that understands her position and has held it through a history that's just been extraordinary the past 70 years.' The Queen sat in the royal box with a blanket over her knees and a shawl around her shoulders as Djalili, the herald and narrator of the performance, took the audience through key historical moments. Mirren, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of the Queen in the film of the same name, played Queen Elizabeth I as the show began by chronicling the events of the first Elizabethan age, from the attempted invasion by the Spanish Armada to featuring leading figures of the day such as William Shakespeare. Highlights included the Royal Cavalry of Oman filling the arena in their display of horsemanship, which had the Queen smiling, and the precision marching and rifle-handling skills of the King's Guard of Norway.", "85f8cf5a2f0adb467989d2d6e07123e3fd8b4b56aecb740c6f4eacda": "The sharp falls in retail sales and industrial production in April is a sign that China's growth rate likely to contract this quarter, warns ING.

Ofgem's proposal to update Britain's price cap every three months could mean bills jump again in January, warns Justina Miltienyte, head of policy at Uswitch.com: Ryanair has warned of a 'fragile' recovery in airline passenger numbers after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Omicron coronavirus variant pushed it to a EUR355m loss for the financial year. The Irish airline would aim for a 'return to reasonable profitability' over the financial year to March 2023, it said on Monday, after it lost EUR1.4bn (PS1.2bn) during the first two pandemic-affected financial years. Airlines have been hanging on for the return of passengers following two years of travel restrictions. There were high hopes for significant earnings in the 2022 summer holiday season after many countries lifted bans on tourism, but the knock-on effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine plus staffing difficulties have clouded airlines' prospects. Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, said 'we hope to return to reasonable profitability' in the coming year and highlighted 'pent-up demand' despite uncertainty. The 'recovery is strong but can be fragile', he said.  Here's the full story: UK energy regulator Ofgem has outlined plans that, if implemented, would see the price cap on bills in Great Britain changed twice as often. Ofgem is proposing that the energy price cap, the mechanism that determines gas and electricity bills for 22 million households, could soon be reviewed every three months, rather than six as it is currently. This would let bills adjust faster to changes in wholesale prices, the regulator argues, and reduce the risk of further supplier failures -- after around 30 energy suppliers collapsed since the start of last year. The cap rose by 54% in April, to PS1,971 per year for an average bill, and could jump to around PS2,900 in October. Ofgem argues that a more frequent cap change means savings would be passed on faster to customers when wholesale gas prices fall. But, it would also allow energy suppliers to pass on rising prices sooner, rather than run at a loss for many months. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley told Sky News it would also mean that bills could go up quicker, but they would also fall more rapidly in reaction to wholesale price shifts. Brearley warned that October is likely to bring more pain to households: Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at interactive investor, warns more regular price increases would worry strugging consumers: In Germany, manufacturers are wrestling with an unprecedented backlog of orders, as supply bottlenecks continue to hit the sector.

Timo Wollmershauser, Head of Forecasts at ifo, explains: In the UK, food-to-go baking chain Greggs says sales in big cities and office locations lagging behind its other stores, as cost pressures rise. In a trading update, Greggs reported that like-for-like sales in company-managed shops are up 27.4% so far this year, partly due to trading restrictions on shops a year ago, and 15.8% over the last 10 weeks. Sales at transport locations have shown a marked increase in activity in recent weeks. However, demand at larger cities and in office locations is slower than at other outlets, with some office workers still working from home part of the week. Greggs reports that: Greggs also warns that 'market-wide cost pressures' have been increasing (such as rising energy costs and raw ingredients such as wheat and oil), and also expects consumer incomes to come under pressure in the second half of the year as inflation keeps rising. Greggs could face a shareholder revolt later this week, with two respected investor advisory groups unhappy about its high pay packets for executives: George Magnus, an associate at Oxford University's China Centre, says layoffs in the property and tech sector are pushing unemployment up in China: Stocks have opened lower in London, as China's April slowdown added to concerns about the economic outlook.

European markets are also lower, with Germany's DAX index down 0.5% and France's CAC down 0.8%. China's property sales fell sharply in April too, as Covid-19 lockdowns hit demand. Reuters has the details: China's property sector has been strugging with a liquidity crisis, after Beijing brought in rules to rein in property developers' debt. That has been exacerbated by strict lockdown measures to combat Covid-19 outbreaks. Last week, Chinese property developer Sunac became the latest company in the sector to default on a bond payment, in a real estate crisis that began at indebted property group Evergrande.

But Fu added that the impact will be 'short-lived', and that the economy will recover. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. China economic slowdown has accelerated as Covid-19 lockdowns hit its factory sector hard, consumers slashed their spending, and unemployment rose. Retail sales and factory output both plunged at the fastest rate since early in the pandemic, with analysts warning of no quick recovery. Retail sales fell by 11.1% in April from a year ago, almost twice as bad as the 6.1% fall expected by economists. It is the biggest slump since March 2020, in the first wave of Covid, with many consumers either under restrictions, or worried about the economic outlook. Industrial production dropped by 2.9% in April, year-on-year, dashing hopes of a rise of 0.4%. That's the biggest fall since early 2020, as the 'zero covid' strategy forced factories to suspend operations and disrupted supply chains. China's labour market took a hit too, with the nationwide jobless rate rising to 6.1% in April, up from 5.8%. That's the highest rate since February 2020. The data shows the rising economic cost from the tough restrictions brought into quash outbreaks of the pandemic, such as lockdowns in Shanghai, and mass testing and quarantine centres in Beijing, where some businesses such as gyms, malls, and cinemas were closed in its largest district. Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis in Hong, told Al Jazeera that ''The data might be only the start of the recession'. The slowdown will add to concerns that the world economy could be weakening. Last night, former Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein warned there was a 'very, very high risk' that the US economy was heading towards a recession. Blankfein, now Goldman's Senior Chairman, told CBS News' 'Face the Nation' that companies and consumers should prepare for a recession as the Federal Reserve lifts interest rates to tackle inflation, but added that it's not 'baked in the cake' yet.  European stock markets are set to open a little lower, having ended last week with a strong rally. But despite that bounce, global stocks sank for a sixth consecutive week, the longest losing streak since the middle of 2008.  The European Commission is set to cut its prediction for 2022 euro-area growth and almost double its estimate for inflation, when it releases its latest economic forecasts today. Draft documents seen by Bloomberg and the FT show that the eurozone is seen growing by 2.7% this year, and 2.3% next year, down from 4% and 2.7% forecast in February. Inflation is expected to rise over 6%, as consumers and businesses are hit by the energy crisis following the Ukraine war. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey faces a grilling over the UK's surge in inflation, when he appears before the Treasury Committee.  Conservative MPs are expected to criticise Bailey's handling of inflation, which is expected to hit 10% later this year. One cabinet minister has told the Telegraph that the Bank has been failing to 'get things right', with another saying government figures were 'questioning its independence'.", "03498076f0176b8aff35a2c8282da55faf42080fc3ca972d33af2e22": "Ryanair has warned of a 'fragile' recovery in airline passenger numbers after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Omicron coronavirus variant pushed it to a EUR355m loss for the financial year.

The 'recovery is strong but can be fragile', he said. 'With luck we'll have a strong summer.' Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the rapid spread of the Omicron variant 'immediately damaged close-in bookings and yields for the Christmas and Easter peak travel periods', O'Leary said. Ryanair's revenues tripled to EUR4.8bn in the year to 31 March 2022 compared with the first year of coronavirus lockdowns. The airline is planning to fly 165 million passengers in the current financial year, up from 97 million in the year to March and an increase even on its peak of 149 million passengers in the years before Covid-19. Yet the company said that ticket pricing in the current financial quarter 'continues to need stimulation' with lower prices to attract more customers. Airlines' ability to attract customers at higher prices is likely to be impacted in the coming months by the cost of living crisis, with families left with less money to spend after covering rising fuel and food prices. O'Leary nevertheless said the company was better placed than rivals, and that it would use any weakness in demand to take a greater market share. He said: 'There's a lot of capacity cutbacks and hopefully we're going to be the beneficiaries of that.' Ryanair is not having to cope with delays in recruitment suffered by rivals as they wait for security approvals, he added, although he criticised airports for failing to cope with increasing numbers of passengers, leading to queues at airport security in several city hubs including Heathrow and Manchester in England. He said he hoped those problems would ease in time for the peak summer period. 'We are seeing pinch points in airports,' he said. 'In Dublin, Berlin, there are airport security queues, where they are struggling to get low-wage, frontline crew into work.' O'Leary also said he was concerned that rivals had 'talked up' the prospects for a strong summer, and that there was a need for caution going into the winter because of the possibility of a new coronavirus variant or a worsening global economy amid global inflationary pressures.", "e978052034ae849266df60ad7b5b0909b1d0f6c533e6c4ec4576dbb6": "Iceland is under pressure to ban the production of a hormone extracted from pregnant horses, a practice that has been described as 'cruel' and 'animal abuse'.The hormone is used by farmers across the UK and Europe to increase reproduction in pigs, cows and other female farm animals. Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) is extracted from pregnant horses in Iceland during the summer at 'blood farms', before being converted into powder and shipped around the world. Animal welfare campaigners in Iceland visiting farms with the Guardian showed broken restraint boxes and enclosures covered in bite marks, which they claimed was a sign of anxious horses. Undercover footage from farms, taken by animal welfare campaigners, also appeared to show distressed horses being hit and struggling in restraint boxes before blood was drawn using a large cannula inserted in their jugular vein. The European Commission said it was 'seriously concerned' about the treatment of horses farmed for blood, while the European parliament has called for imports of the hormone to be banned. In late March, an international coalition of 17 NGOs submitted a complaint against Iceland to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Surveillance Authority (ESA), which monitors compliance with European Economic Area (EEA) rules in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The complaint accused Iceland of breaching EEA law on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and said Icelandic authorities should ban blood collection. Support for a ban is also growing within Iceland. The opposition People's party has put a bill through parliament calling for a ban. The bill, which is awaiting a vote, is supported by groups including the Icelandic Tourism Association. A working group, set up by Iceland's Fisheries and Agriculture department is due to report its findings this summer. Experts have also expressed concern about the amount of blood taken from horses. The pharmaceutical company Isteka, which owns or subcontracts farms, said five litres of blood are taken from pregnant mares every week for eight consecutive weeks - around four times the amount specified on international guidelines. The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (Mast), which granted Isteka a licence, said: 'There is no indication that blood collection of five litres a week for up to eight weeks has a negative impact on the health and welfare of the mares or their foals.' Ingunn Reynisdottir, a veterinarian who lives in north Iceland and has worked with horses all her life, disagreed. 'It's too much [blood] and if you take too much they are trembling and have difficulty walking,' she said. Mette Uldahl, vice-president of the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe (FVE), said of the practice: 'It's animal abuse and it's cruelty. You shouldn't use untrained horses because they get too scared.' Iceland is home to about 80,000 Icelandic horses, 5,383 of which are used as 'blood mares'. There are 119 blood farms operating in the country. Blood farms are believed to have been operating in Iceland for about 40 years, but Icelanders who spoke to the Guardian said they had little knowledge of them until last November, when the Animal Welfare Foundation undercover video was shown on television. A survey in December found most of the population was opposed to the blood farms. 'I didn't have a clue we were doing this here and I was shocked when I saw it,' said Bjarnheidur Hallsdottir, chair of the Icelandic Travel Industry Association. 'It [is] awful.' 'I would like people to know that Iceland is actually stabbing semi-wild pregnant mares, taking their blood in extreme volumes and frequency, just to ... make pigs have more pigs,' said Rosa Lif Darradottir, a medical doctor and horse owner in Reykjavik. In Germany, 6.4m single doses of PMSG - the equivalent of about 32,000 litres of blood - were given to sows between 2016 and 2019, according to the federal ministry of food and agriculture. PMSG can be obtained legally in the UK from a registered vet, with products available including vaginal sponges for sheep, which induce early lambing, with advertised benefits such as producing lambs 'at the optimum time for autumn sales'. A spokesperson said the EU commission believes dialogue with non-EU countries is crucial to 'bringing positive change on animal welfare issues'. 'The EU cannot impose its animal welfare standards in third countries and our trade policy has to respect the rules of the World Trade Organization. For this reason, the commission continues to address the importance of improving the welfare conditions of horses involved in the production of PMSG at multilateral level in the framework of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).'

The book features characters such as 'King Donald' and his enemy 'Hillary Queenton'. In the book, titled 'The Plot Against the King' and set to be published by Brave Books, Patel repeats Trump's false claim that the FBI began investigating links between his campaign and Russia based on a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy. The 35-page tome, complete with an epilogue that details Donald Trump's false claims about the FBI inquiry, bizarrely uses the tool of children's fictional characters to provide a revisionist account of the probe that dogged the first two years of the Trump presidency and eventually led to a special counsel investigation. Over the course of the book, the narrative lionises Patel and depicts him as a wizard who supposedly shows how 'the King' Trump was wrongly accused of 'cheating' to take the throne. The book claims the king was accused of cheating by a 'shifty knight' - a reference to the Democratic chair of the intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, who claims to have a 'paper' from a 'steel' box attesting to wrongdoing. But Patel writes that he then found evidence that the slug 'Keeper Komey' - a reference to former FBI director James Comey - put slugs in the 'steel' box at the behest of 'Hillary Queenton', who was also vying for the throne - a reference to Clinton. The wizard Patel then proclaims to the kingdom, the book says, that 'the king, King Donald, is innocent' and 'did not work with the Russonians' - a reference to Russia - and 'Hillary wrote that paper and had her sneaky slugs slide into the steel box'. In reality the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign after a foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, told an Australian diplomat that Russia had political 'dirt' on Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The information in the Steele Dossier did not reach FBI officials involved in the investigation until almost a year after the 2016 election, and even the then-Republican House intelligence committee for which Patel worked found no evidence for Trump's claim. But the illustrated children's book authored by Patel, a pre-publication copy of which the Guardian received unsolicited, makes no mention of that conclusion, or an additional memo stating conclusively that the FBI investigation did not originate with the Steele Dossier. Patel enjoyed a rapid rise from an obscure staffer on the Republican staff of the House intelligence committee after he endorsed Trump's false claims that the FBI wiretapped Trump's phones and was eventually promoted to chief of staff at the Department of Defense.", "373673da3866b0b335addec5725e129f174c899a975a5bda7dfdd98c": "", "442169c08fc15cb061ba832410a10ff3b27a644f5333e295a6827d94": "", "11e7d6b98c258cc8375510c2728f733bb83b5ec264c9dfb6f1a65a08": "", "8a6ca4592c6928233b75d23153b0e3ec7858b1d8e23e4bb6c0232c6a": "", "b421d2bbbb1a6e33008f138e6db765c35b21a7e1f65ed57ecddafda6": "", "542f6cf64d7bd805bb6760023051b6da01b290c918dbe88ea87dd031": "The latest wireless earbuds from Sennheiser are smaller, longer lasting and have better sound and noise cancelling than their predecessors, making them some of the best on the market. Priced at PS219.99 ($249.95/A$399.5), the third-generation Momentum true wireless earbuds look set to dethrone Sony's WF-1000XM4 as the best-sounding earbuds you can buy. Succeeding the excellent 2020 model and adopting a similar design to the firm's cheaper CX series of earbuds, they are 16% smaller and so fit better in my ears, making them more comfortable to wear for longer periods. And their squarer, smoother form is far less distinctive than their predecessor's Rolo-like form. They feel light, really well made, and have IPX4 sweat resistance, which means they should be fine in the rain or workouts. Just don't submerge them in liquid. The Sennheiser logo on the earbuds is a touchpad for a full set of customisable controls including volume and noise-cancelling modes, which work very well. Few competitors have as many options here. The battery lasts for about 6.5 hours of music with noise cancelling turned on, which is a hour or so short of Sony's best but still very good. The case can fully charge the earbuds three times, and is topped up via USB-C or Qi wireless charging. It takes 90 minutes to fully charge the earbuds, but a 10-minute charge in the case is enough to add one hour of playback. The best bit about the earbuds is how good they sound, producing rich, detailed audio with excellent separation of instruments. They are reasonably bassy, but low notes are punchy and well controlled. There is a bass boost function too, but I don't think many will need it. Mid tones and high notes are detailed and well balanced, vocals are clear, and most music genres sound great. They lack a bit of energy in some electronica tracks but do a better job with jazz and classical than most competitors. There is a full equaliser and an option to create a custom setting through a short listening test. Sennheiser has promised to add a full sound personalisation setting that will go beyond simple equaliser adjustments in a future update. The earbuds have very effective active noise cancelling , which is capable of reducing most rumbles, fan noise and road noise by adjusting the level of noise suppression automatically to the environment. Its wind noise reduction setting is the best I have tried and the ambient awareness mode is good too. But they struggle a bit with speech and higher tones, such as the taps of fingers on a keyboard, and can't quite match the performance of Sony's class-leading WF-1000XM4. The earbuds support standard Bluetooth 5.2 with the universal SBC and AAC audio formats. But they also support the very latest aptX Adaptive audio format, which when used with a compatible device offers better audio quality and lower latency, which is particularly good for gaming. Only a handful of newer Android smartphones support aptX Adaptive at the moment, however. The earbuds can be used independently of each other, which is handy for calls. My voice sounded a bit robotic on the phone but was clear even when speaking in loud environments, effectively suppressing background noise. The Bluetooth connection to a range of phones, tablets and computers was rock solid, but they only connect to one device at a time at the moment. An update to support connection to two devices simultaneously (multi-point), such as a laptop and a phone, is promised at a later date. Sennheiser estimates the batteries in the earbuds and case will maintain at least 80% of their original capacity after four years of daily use, listening for two hours a day, but the batteries are not replaceable, ultimately making them disposable. Spare parts including tips, earbuds and cases are available. The earbuds do not contain any recycled material and Sennheiser does not publish impact assessments or operate trade-in schemes in the UK. The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 come in a choice of three colours costing PS219.99 ($249.95/A$399.5). For comparison, the Sony WF-1000XM4 cost PS229, Beats Fit Pro cost PS199, Apple AirPods Pro cost PS249, the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro cost PS219, Jabra Elite 7 Pro cost PS199, the Bose QC Earbuds cost PS249.95 and the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 cost PS99. The third-generation of Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless earbuds are an upgrade in almost all areas. They are some of the best-sounding Bluetooth earbuds you can get, have good noise cancelling, great controls, good battery life and support for the latest aptX Adaptive audio format. Despite still being at the premium end of the market costing PS220, they are more competitive thanks to a price cut over their predecessors, too. The case is a little bigger than some, their design a little less interesting than before and they are waiting on an update for multi-point connection, but the worst thing about them is you can't replace the battery so they are ultimately disposable, losing a star.", "5ba32727a969519c381129942605b3db16908cb3e0d2c8db08943334": "", "b2a9c5dc7ade8a34ffa38a6e5d6045133766c7eedd38cfb7b3f81ac0": "", "919e47070ba35e2ae9ec2de0e529a1f5e000a98959cee8cb18612f93": "What do you call an engaged toilet on a Jumbo jet?

The first four are standard word or number conundrums, while the remaining five are lateral thinking puzzles, a MacHale speciality and a crowd-pleasing genre I feature too infrequently in this column. Some require you to think like a novelist, conjuring up a believable situation that results in the relevant scenario. Others are misleading you by presenting a word or phrase that can be interpreted in more than one way. Take note. 1.

Des MacHale is an algebraist, with more than 100 academic papers in refereed journals. Yet he gained fame early in his career as a humorist. In 1976 he wrote the Book of Kerryman Jokes, which went on to sell half a million copies in Ireland. He has written many other joke books, including a compendium of Boris Johnson jokes. His prolific output also includes four books on the Irish mathematician George Boole, and many books of puzzles. MacHale's two main interests - maths and humour - merge in his most recent book, Comic Sections Plus, an updated edition of his classic book of mathematical wit. 'I would have humour lessons in all schools,' he says. 'Logic and riddles are basic links between mathematics and humour; mathematics is ultra logical and humour turns logic on its head.' His 20 books of lateral thinking puzzles are co-written with Paul Sloane. 'I am hopeless at solving them but good I think at making them up,' he says. 'Everybody enjoys logical thinking and being the first to get a solution.' On that note, how are you all getting on...? Thanks to Des MacHale for today's puzzles.

For those who want to protect abortion rights, a governor's veto pen is about to become all the more powerful. The probable end of Roe has raised the stakes in gubernatorial races across the country, particularly in states with Republican-led legislatures that would probably move to ban abortion unless a Democratic governor steps in. Democratic gubernatorial candidates are now stressing the urgency of the moment to voters, portraying themselves as the last line of defense against an abortion ban in their states. Four states with Republican-controlled legislatures and Democratic governors - Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - are holding gubernatorial races in November. Democrats are also paying close attention to gubernatorial elections in battleground states where Republicans currently control both the governor's mansion and the state legislature, such as Georgia and Arizona. If the supreme court overturns Roe and Republicans have full control of the state government, abortion bans in those states will become all but certain. Some of the toss-up states holding gubernatorial races this year - including Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona - already have abortion bans on the books that predate Roe, and Republicans have called for their enforcement if the court reverses the landmark case. In Kansas and Pennsylvania, the sitting Democratic governors have both previously vetoed bills restricting abortion access, and those proposals would probably be enacted if a Republican took control. 'The leaked draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade makes one thing clear - the future of reproductive rights will be defined at the state level,' said Christina Amestoy, senior communications advisor for the Democratic Governors Association. 'Who sits in the governor's office will determine a woman's ability to access abortion.' Since the court's draft opinion was made public, Republican gubernatorial candidates' views on abortion have come under renewed scrutiny. In Pennsylvania, all four leading Republican gubernatorial candidates have indicated they would support some form of an abortion ban. State senator Doug Mastriano, who now leads in polls ahead of the Tuesday primary, said at a recent debate that he would oppose any exceptions to an abortion ban, such as for rape, incest or the safety of the mother. Josh Shapiro, the presumptive Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Pennsylvania, has already cut an attack ad warning that Mastriano 'wants to ban abortion' if elected. 'Every one of our opponents has made it clear: they would sign a bill banning abortion and taking away a woman's right to choose,' said Shapiro's spokesperson, Manuel Bonder. 'With DC failing to protect these rights, Josh Shapiro will stand up and fight to ensure Pennsylvania remains a place where everyone has the freedom to start a family how and when they want to.' Katie Hobbs, a Democrat running for governor in Arizona, has similarly promised that she will use her veto pen to block abortion restrictions, while also calling for a repeal of the state's 1901 law that criminalizes administering the procedure. 'I will do everything in my power to protect Arizonans' fundamental freedoms and access to reproductive healthcare, and use my veto power to strike down anti-abortion measures that come across my desk,' Hobbs said after the draft opinion leaked. And Democratic gubernatorial candidates are not simply waiting until election day to take action for the potential end of Roe. Stacey Abrams, the voting rights leader running for governor of Georgia, temporarily paused fundraising for her campaign earlier this month to instead raise money for abortion rights groups. In Michigan, the Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has filed a lawsuit to block implementation of a 1931 abortion ban that does not allow for exceptions related to rape or incest. Whitmer has also asked the Michigan supreme court to recognize the right to abortion access under the state's constitution. In her New York Times op-ed published last week, Whitmer warned that it would be nearly impossible to repeal the 1931 ban with Republicans controlling the Michigan legislature, and she underscored the need for Democrats to use every tool at their disposal to protect abortion rights. 'We can all sense the hopelessness and despair that tens of millions of American women - our neighbors, family members and friends - are feeling,' Whitmer said. 'But despair is a choice, and pessimism is a luxury. We must take unprecedented steps to protect the right to choose.' The likely end of Roe has also started to affect some gubernatorial primaries, as candidates use their views on abortion to distinguish themselves from their opponents. David Perdue, the Trump-backed gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, has called on the sitting Republican governor, Brian Kemp, to call the state legislature back for an emergency session to pass an abortion ban if Roe is overturned. 'Georgia voters deserve to know where their governor stands on this issue,' Perdue said after the draft opinion leaked. 'You are either going to fight for the sanctity of life or you're not.' But for the most part, Republicans have tried to downplay how much the end of Roe would affect the midterm elections. 'Reminder for those wondering about the politics of the leaked Scotus opinion, Terry McAuliffe spent all fall trying to make abortion THE central issue in the Virginia gov race,' Jesse Hunt, communications director for the Republican Governors Association, said earlier this month. 'He lost by 2% in a state Biden won by 10%.' Polls show that the probable end of Roe has certainly caught voters' attention, although many Americans remain more focused on economic issues like record-high inflation. A survey released by Monmouth University last week showed 26% of Americans named economic policy as their most significant concern for the midterm elections, making it the most common response. But abortion was cited almost as often, with 25% of Americans selecting it as their top priority when appraising candidates. Amestoy argued Democratic gubernatorial candidates do not have to choose between campaigning on their plan to combat inflation and their promise to protect abortion rights. Instead, she encouraged candidates to use their opponents' views on abortion to paint Republicans as out of touch with the needs of average Americans. 'Republicans are campaigning on extreme, fringe agendas, like banning abortion, rather than on delivering for families,' Amestoy said. 'It's a stark contrast Democratic governors and candidates can draw while they work to address the concerns voters care most about.' Drawing that contrast is even more important for Democratic gubernatorial candidates with federal abortion legislation stalled in Congress. Last Wednesday, Senate Republicans and Democrat Joe Manchin again blocked a bill that would have codified Roe and secured abortion rights at the national level. If the supreme court does indeed overturn Roe next month without other federal protections in place, individual states' policies will soon dictate if and how Americans can access abortion. 'The reproductive freedoms of millions of Americans are on the line,' Amestoy said. 'Electing Democratic governors is our best and perhaps only hope of protecting them.'", "d05f59ddd014fdc55bd84f9fbe9aee5ccd1564b081d0d3c177ba5d0b": "One morning last summer, Nasira* arrived for work at the government building in Kabul where she was employed in a managerial position to find men from the Taliban had occupied her office. 'I wasn't allowed to enter,' the 32-year-old says. 'When I enquired why, I was told to wait for a government announcement, which never came.' This was shortly after the Taliban swept to power and seized Kabul, the capital city, on 15 August 2021. That was the last day that Nasira and thousands of women like her were able to go to work. Though the Taliban's acting prime minister, Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, claimed that women would be allowed to continue working under sharia law, female government employees in Kabul were told to stay at home, and only women whose jobs cannot be done by men were allowed to work. Nasira is technically still employed and receives a significantly reduced salary. 'They tell me, 'we are paying you, what else do you need?' But money is not my priority,' she says. 'I was responsible for our department's services to women citizens. I want to serve my people, especially the women of my country, who are not receiving services they need because there are no women officials to help them.' It is not only government positions that women have been forced out of. According to Reporters Without Borders, only 100 of Kabul's 700 female journalists were still working by the end of 2021. In 2019, 36% of teachers in the country were women, according World Bank data, the highest number for 20 years, but the Taliban's ban in March on education for girls forced many female educators out of work. Sima Bahous, the UN Women executive director, said this month: 'Current restrictions on women's employment have been estimated to result in an immediate economic loss of up to $1bn - or up to 5% of Afghanistan's GDP.' She added: 'There is almost universal poverty in the country.' The Afghan academic and former minister of mines, Nargis Nehan, says: 'It is hard to collect data under the Taliban, and access to information is limited, but under the previous government 27% of the civil servants and almost 40% of the teachers were women. But only a handful of women are allowed to work these days.'  The latest in the series of decrees issued by the recently reinstated ministry for the propagation of virtue requires 'all respectable Afghan women to wear a hijab' - and identifying the chador (the blue Afghan burqa) as the 'best hijab' of choice - will have a significant impact on the remaining women in public roles. The order also went on to criminalise women's clothes and said female government employees who violated the dress code would be fired. 'As per the Afghan Women's Chamber of Commerce, we had over 3,500 small and medium business owners who were women, the majority of whom are now closed because they couldn't survive,' Nehan says. 'Because how do you expect women to work or run a business under a chador or facing fear of punishment for showing their face?' A gynaecologist from Herat, who wishes to be identified only as Dr Maryam, says: 'Even before this decree, they made hijab mandatory for women doctors, and require female surgeons to wear long sleeves, and a long scarf, even during surgery. It affects the way they work and is not safe.' Armed Taliban officials often force themselves into the hospital, she adds, especially during night shifts, to 'monitor the work' of the female doctors and nurses. 'They had also briefly insisted on women doctors having their mahram [male guardian] with them at all times, which is not practical especially on a women's ward.'  There are no figures for the number of women who have left healthcare roles, but according to an article from the BMJ, women make up nearly half of Afghanistan's community health worker programme. 'One hospital in Kabul reported that segregation of men and women, for staff as well as patients, had been requested already,' the BMJ said. 'Women are especially restricted in their freedom of movement and often require male guardians to merely leave their homes. Even midwives have to be accompanied when doing home visits. Due to lack of information, some are stuck at home entirely, waiting for new directions.' 'Although these restrictions are not new - I recall working under the Taliban regime the last time they were in power and had imposed similar restrictions - they are new to this generation, and will discourage younger women from joining professions under the Taliban's hateful gaze,' Maryam says. 'Do we really want to go back to those days? How will it benefit Afghanistan?'  The Taliban takeover prompted many Afghan female doctors, especially those who worked in reproductive and sexual health, to flee the country. Those who remained are now facing threats from local Taliban leaders for not complying with their rules, Maryam says. Afghan women have made significant inroads into various sectors over the past 20 years, after the fall of the Taliban in 2001. According to World Bank data, women comprised nearly 22% of the Afghan workforce and numbers were steadily growing.  But a report from the International Labour Organization (ILO) in January found that Afghan women's employment levels fell by an estimated 16% in the third quarter of 2021, compared with 6% for men. Women's employment was expected to be 21% lower than before the Taliban takeover by mid-2022 if current conditions continued, according to the ILO, though this does not take into account employees such as Nasira who are still paid without being allowed to work. Restricting women from participating in economic and public activities will have a dire impact on the economy, a UN report warned last December. It could, for example, shave half a billion dollars from household consumption alone. Nasira's supervisor, who wished be identified only as Abdul, confirms that services have been affected since female colleagues were sent home. 'I had seven women in my team and, since the Taliban takeover, none of them has been allowed back to work. They were the backbone of the department, and to be honest, they were more hardworking than the men,' he says. 'Not only has our workload increased, we are unable to provide adequate technical services to Afghan women, who were way more comfortable approaching our female staff with their problems. We are worse off without our female colleagues.' * Some names have been changed.

You might like to do the same at home, or on the train, or wherever you are. Now think of the person that you love most in the world. Got them? Remember the last time you made them laugh out loud. One-two-three. 'Did that bring a smile to your face?' asks Cacioppo, a neuroscientist at the University of Chicago, who specialises on the impact of love on the brain, and is the author of a new book, Wired for Love. It did. 'It works all the time,' she goes on. 'It's because of this fantastic wiring we have in our brain that activates the love network, but also the mirror neuron system. That's the neuro system that is activated when you move, but also when you anticipate or think about the actions or emotions of others. So imagining someone smiling, it's like activating your own smile as well.' Dr Cacioppo suggests the exercise might be useful for astronauts, who can spend months away from their loved ones on a space station. It could also come in handy, say, during a global pandemic that makes us housebound for the better part of two years. But the memory game has a personal resonance for Cacioppo, who is 47 and has a big smile and rolling wave of platinum-blonde hair. In March 2018 her partner, Dr John Cacioppo, a social neuroscientist who was a pioneer of research into loneliness, died unexpectedly, aged 66. Theirs had, in some ways, been an unlikely relationship: not least because it brought together two experts who had been christened in the media as Dr Love and Dr Loneliness. When they met in January 2011 at a neuroscience research symposium in Shanghai, she was in her mid-30s and he was in his late-50s; both were adamant they were not looking for a partner. But in less than a year, they were married and inseparable. They worked inches apart at one desk and shared an office at the University of Chicago with 'The Cacioppos' on the door. They came at their research from opposite ends of the spectrum, but both passionately believed that the human need for social connection was as essential to a person's wellbeing as clean water, nutritious food or exercise. So, when Stephanie Cacioppo closes her eyes, she sees John. 'Love is a biological necessity. We cannot live without it,' she says. 'And that's hard to say for someone who lost their best friend, their soul mate, and the love of their life. But I realised that love does not have to be with the person who is physically here with you. Like we mentioned with the astronaut, we can be in love with someone even if they live far away from you. Or even if they passed away; we lost so many people in our lives during Covid and I think many people can relate to that. 'One key to keeping John's love alive was actually to realise that he was gone, and to face the pain that he was not physically here,' Cacioppo goes on. 'And once I let go, once I really faced that pain, I saw him everywhere, all around me. In different ways I could feel his love and I still really feel his love everywhere. That was beautiful for me and I hope that can inspire people to feel connected and not lonely.' Wired for Love: a Neuroscientist's Journey Through Romance, Loss and the Essence of Human Connection is very much not the book that Cacioppo expected to write. She has spent her career attempting to prove that love was a worthy subject of scientific study (she received strong pushback on this idea from other researchers who considered it a primitive impulse, almost an addiction). Her work was evidence-based: she conducted electroencephalogram (EEG) tests to track electrical signals produced by the brain and functional MRI scanning techniques to delineate between love and lust. Understanding love was about science, not stories or, heaven forfend, poetry. It was an important time for an in-depth analysis of love, Cacioppo felt. By several parameters, humans appear to be experiencing less love, and more loneliness, than ever before. Marriage rates for opposite-sex couples have been in steady decline in the UK since the 1970s. In 2018, the Office for National Statistics reported that they were the lowest ever recorded. Despite the proliferation of dating apps, we seem to be having less sex than ever. In 2018, nearly a quarter of Americans - again, another record - said they had no sexual encounters in the previous year. Among the factors believed to contribute to this 'sex drought' are smartphones, the gig economy, open-plan offices (perhaps counterintuitively) and more people living in cities. But when Cacioppo came to work on her serious science book, details of her own relationship with John kept bobbing to the surface. As she wrote them down, she began to realise that she had never told even her closest friends most of what happened in their rollercoaster, seven-year relationship. 'Sharing that story was really excruciating,' she says, 'because it's really against my nature. I'm a shy and private person, but I felt like it was kind of a mission for me to conquer my shyness and share my story and the science behind my story with the readers. The hope being that it will help people not only appreciate more the beauty and the nature of human connections, but also perhaps find love and maintain love in their own life.' The strange truth is that romantic love has been elusive for Dr Love for most of her life. Growing up in the outskirts of Chambery in the French Alps, Stephanie Ortigue was the only child of passionate French-Italian parents who set a dauntingly high bar for what a relationship should look and feel like. To avoid feeling like a gooseberry, she threw herself first into tennis and then science. 'I didn't understand why I was born an only child,' says Cacioppo, who now lives in Oregon, in a house near some woods with her dog, a shar-pei called Bacio. 'I thought that just because of that, that was my fate: I was born alone, I will die alone. Typical romantic, French dramatic. And on top of that, my dear Italian grandmother told me to dress up nicely every day just in case that was the last day of our life. So my attitude was: I live as if I were going to die tomorrow and I enjoy life as if I am going to live forever. 'On top of that, I had my parents displaying this beautiful, perfect relationship that seems quite honestly unattainable. But it was inspiring and I love challenges. So I don't take impossible as an answer and I always thought that maybe one day...' Cacioppo didn't have serious boyfriends as a teenager or in college, and in her 20s she threw herself into her research, initially at the Geneva University Hospital and then Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. One of her early findings was that romantic love seemed to activate 12 specific brain regions. Some of these were not a big surprise: Cacioppo expected it to fire up the so-called 'emotional' brain and the dopamine-hungry 'reward' system. What was unexpected was that passionate love - distinct from friendship or maternal love - also triggered some of the most sophisticated, higher-order regions of the brain. One in particular: the angular gyrus. The angular gyrus, which is found tucked behind the ear, was developed relatively recently in our evolutionary history (only apes and humans have it). It is generally linked to abstract thought and language; photos of Einstein's brain have shown that this area was unusually large. For Cacioppo, the discovery was proof that 'love played a more complex role in the brain than anyone could have reasonably guessed'. Her research also showed that, while we might believe that how we experienced love was unique, what was happening on a biological level was pretty much identical for all of us. 'Regardless of where you were born, whether you were gay or straight, male, female, transgendered, if a person - or persons - were significant to you, they can light up this network in the same essential way,' Cacioppo writes in Wired for Love. It was groundbreaking work, but for Cacioppo personally, love remained a theoretical concept. That changed at the conference in Shanghai in 2011. She has no doubt that 'love at first sight' exists and there is scientific research to back it up: directeye-to-eye contact has been shown to spark activity in that core area of the angular gyrus. 'I felt really fulfilled in a way, at that time,' recalls Cacioppo. 'And I genuinely thought I was happy until I met my husband, who really proved me wrong! I was happier with him than ever before.' In the beginning, John Cacioppo, who had been married twice before, was the more wary of the pair. After their first meeting, with him back in Chicago and her in Geneva, it was Stephanie who sent the follow-up message. 'I've always been a fiercely independent woman, but yes, I did send that email,' she says. 'And I'm really glad I did. Because his prefrontal cortex - what I call 'the parents in the brain' - was more dominant than his intuition, or the part of his mind that felt like his heart. So I don't think he would ever have sent an email.' The Cacioppos' relationship moved fast, and in many ways they felt like they had the blessing of the science. Stephanie's research suggested there were significant mental and physical benefits to being in love: rather than being distracted, people in love can benefit from the explosion of activity in their angular gyrus and be more creative and motivated. Likewise, data from one of John's studies found that chronic loneliness increases the odds of an early death by 20%. This was about the same impact as being obese - 'though obesity does not make you as miserable as loneliness', John Cacioppo told the Observer in 2016. 'We joked about Dr Loneliness meeting Dr Love, but the title didn't really play a role in our relationship,' she says. 'But our science really was part of our life: we tried to apply our science to everyday to make sure that Dr Love and Dr Loneliness will have this lasting love and will be happy ever after.' Theirs was not an uncomplicated coupling. In 2015, John was diagnosed with a rare form of salivary gland cancer; he had to undergo aggressive chemotherapy and radiation treatment, and for months was fed through a tube. But he recovered well enough to return to full-time teaching. His appetite came back and he rebuilt his depleted body with daily exercise sessions. Eventually, he was told by doctors that he had 'turned another corner', but soon afterwards he started coughing violently. The cancer had spread to his lungs. In Wired for Love, Cacioppo is unsparing about the impact her husband's death had on her: she was depressed, unsure that 'a meaningful life' was still possible. Today, she is still clearly raw, but defiant. 'When you go through all these emotions, like I did, you feel like the passenger of your life, rather than the driver of your life,' she says. 'And this is really disturbing in a way, because you really don't know what's happening. 'But I'm a living proof of my science; I survived partly thanks to it,' Cacioppo continues. 'That's why I want to share it with readers; I want to share that experience and all the tricks and drills of the mind. And help them understand how the brain works, so then they can regain control of their own brain and feel that they are in charge of their emotions, rather than being the victim of their emotions.' The first stage of recovery for Cacioppo was exercise. She ran six miles a day (a 20-minute daily walk will also help) and realised she was happiest when she was helping others. 'Losing my husband was a huge mental shower,' she says. 'I really understood what was important in life - and it's not me. I used to be an only child, always spoiled and the centre of attention, at least for my Italian grandmother. But now I see there is something bigger than me and it's very humbling.' One of the great challenges for our society, says Cacioppo, is tackling loneliness. It's an invidious problem, but there are strategies that can help. 'The worst thing you can do to a lonely person is try to help them,' she notes in Wired for Love. 'If you know somebody who's lonely, ask them to help you. Being shown respect, being depended upon, being made to understand your own importance - all these things can give a lonely person a sense of worth and belonging.' Even the simple exercise we started the article with can reduce feelings of isolation. 'Understanding that our brain is our best friend,' says Cacioppo, 'that we can really stay connected with others just with the power of our mind, just by imagining them with us right now, that will also help people feel less lonely.' As for what's next for Cacioppo, personally and professionally, she's not sure. 'I'll talk to my dog and see what she thinks about it,' she says, with a giggle. But then she turns more serious. 'If there is one take-home message from my story, it doesn't come from me, it comes from Maya Angelou, who beautifully wrote, 'Have enough courage to trust love one more time and always one more time.''

The edited video, released by the Ukrainian military, showed the strike and its aftermath - all taken from a Turkish-designed Bayraktar TB2 drone. Until then, evidence of the TB2 - a remotely piloted killer drone with a range of up to 190 miles - had largely disappeared from the conflict. The assumption was that the two dozen or so that Ukraine had bought from Turkey had been shot down and Ankara, not wanting to upset Russia, had declined to supply more. Yet the battle for control of Snake Island suggested the picture had changed. A day later, another TB2 video, accompanied by the pumping music typical of these propaganda releases, showed a landing craft being destroyed; a day after that, the downing of an Mi-8 helicopter as Russian troops were disembarking. Death from a distance, shown on social media video. An aviation analyst, Amelia Smith, spotted that one of the drone videos indicated the drone had a new registration: T253 - not seen in Ukraine before. It had been spotted being tested in late March around the manufacturer's test facility in Turkey, suggesting it was newly supplied, perhaps part of a new batch. One week on, Russia said it had shot down nine TB2 drones, which cost somewhere between $1m (PS820,000) to $2m each, plus several other uncrewed aircraft, in the battle for Snake Island. While that claim is hard to verify, control of the territory is still being contested, for all the videoed strikes. The TB2s are clearly militarily effective - and are used for all their propaganda worth. But it is not obvious they are militarily decisive. The point is not lost on Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who said in April: 'With all due respect to Bayraktar, and to any hardware, I will tell you, frankly, this is a different war.' The 11-week conflict - in which Russia's invasion has stalled after capturing most of the south coast and some of the east of the country - has become, since the abortive attempt to take Kyiv, largely a battle of tanks and artillery in which both sides exchange heavy and often unguided fire as they fight over increasingly small amounts of territory. This is not to suggest that drones are irrelevant. However, it reflects in part the reality that for both sides, the larger armed drones - the TB2s on the Ukrainian side and Russia's nearest equivalent, the Orion drone - have not been present in large numbers and once eliminated are not easy to replace. Sam Bendett, a drone expert with the US Center for Naval Analyses thinktank, said the Ukrainian military had taken advantage of the fact that Russia did not control all the airspace and that it did not have persistent electronic warfare defences 'with some very accurate and significant strikes'. But he added: 'What is needed from their perspective is to do so on a much larger scale.' Russia knew it needed to counter the TB2 from the 2020 war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, in which Azerbaijan used Turkish drones to knock out Armenia's Russian-designed tanks and gain a decisive advantage. Moscow had long lagged behind in drone technology, said Douglas Barrie, an aerospace analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. 'Russia is having to play catchup. They have underinvested in this area since the early 1990s, just as they underinvested across the board,' he said. Moscow started deploying Orion combat drones in Ukraine in March, followed almost immediately by reports one had been shot down. 'They went into the war with a limited supply, the consequence of decisions made years ago; perhaps with two or three dozen Orions, instead of having a larger number,' Bendett said. Ukraine has wasted little opportunity in trying to demonstrate the homespun nature of Russian drones: videos of a downed Orlan 10 reconnaissance drone being taken apart show it relies on a consumer Canon DSLR camera with key buttons glued into position and, for its fuel tank, parts of a water bottle, including the screw-on top. 'No original part' was made in Russia, the Ukrainians conclude in the video, and the true cost of the drone was estimated at $3,000 rather than the $80,000 to $120,000 official cost. It is probably a reasonable estimate, but in reality, even Turkish TB2 drones have relied on off-the-shelf components to keep costs down and the pace of manufacturing up. Meanwhile, as the war becomes increasingly attritional, and armed drones are knocked out of the sky, new drones are coming to the fore. The US has agreed to supply to Ukraine at least 700 of the less sophisticated single-use, or kamikaze, Switchblade 300 and 600 drones, with a range of six or 25 miles, loitering munitions that can hang in the sky and smash down, with fearful effect on their target. Switchblades have started to arrive on the frontline - a Ukrainian video from a week ago purports to show a Russian position struck from above, followed by soldiers fleeing in terror. But again, although the number of kamikaze drones appears large, the stockpile may be quickly depleted as the war continues. Prof Peter Lee, a drones expert at Portsmouth University, said that in a war where 'no side has control of the air' the most significant use of drones has instead been for 'intelligence gathering and situational awareness - exactly what aircraft were first used for 100 years ago'. Each side has made heavy use of simple, commercially available drones for reconnaissance, with videos frequently released into the public domain, such as an edited montage of footage of a Russian armoured column being ambushed in Brovary, east of Kyiv, in March. Drone footage of artillery shelling, attacks on armoured vehicles and other fighting on both sides have become a routine feature of the war. Such has been the demand for simple camera drones that China's DJI, the world's largest manufacturer, chose in April to suspend sales of its easy-to-use drones to Ukraine and, more surprisingly, to Russia - although it is unclear if the ban will have a meaningful effect. One expert has estimated that Ukraine is operating as many as 6,000 reconnaissance drones on the battlefield. 'Drones are not a war-winning technology,' Lee said. 'But they are a war-enabling technology, and what we have seen is Ukraine responding in a quicker and more agile way.'", "5393ad603e0dc64bf46e9021f3d9dad0e4c333a2ca57a14440280911": "", "cfce8f33557c71013f0ea89ee7e7cb96e6bf5bdbb3c42c17e5456a1d": "", "e6196a7b775c89452d01685228632caf9e88f683353bcfbf743821ed": "", "450d43751ff3c95997b35efcedd1790109c582130170428935c8150d": "", "7834f8bbb4bb5a77af56d28dd8f6661e0ae5b205a7675650b311e2f9": "", "59da6a4abe6f44cd719548caeefa848adf7ad5dce9e262113fed3228": "", "a9ee2752d492d797aace372cf57d83e5ef769dbe5a57c4de1ab2dcb4": "Russia may have lost a third of the invasion force it sent into Ukraine as its offensive continues to struggle in the face of stiff resistance, British military intelligence has said. In its latest assessment, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the Russian campaign in the east of Ukraine had 'lost momentum' and was now 'significantly behind schedule'. At a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Berlin, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said it was essential to maintain support for the government in Kyiv to help it 'push Russia out'. She said in a statement: 'Putin must face a sustained defeat in Ukraine, Russia must be contained and such aggression must never happen again. 'Ukraine's security must come from it being able to defend itself. Allies must support Ukraine's move to Nato-standard equipment, immediately providing artillery, training and the required expertise.' The Nato deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoana, said the Ukrainians were now in a position to defeat the Russians and win the war. 'The brutal invasion of Russia is losing momentum,' he told reporters. 'With significant support from allies and partners in billions of dollars, in military support, in financial support, humanitarian support, we know that with the bravery of the Ukrainian people and army and with our help, Ukraine can win this war.' The Russians switched the focus of their offensive to the eastern Donbas region - which was already part-held by pro-Moscow separatists - after their advance on Kyiv was driven back. However the MoD said despite small-scale initial advances, they had failed to make any substantial territorial gains over the past month while suffering 'consistently high levels of attrition'. It said the offensive was being further hampered by the loss of 'critical enablers' such as bridging equipment and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drones. 'Russia has now likely suffered losses of one-third of the ground combat force it committed in February,' it said. 'Russian forces are increasingly constrained by degraded enabling capabilities, continued low morale and reduced combat effectiveness. 'Many of these capabilities cannot be quickly replaced or reconstituted and are likely to continue to hinder Russian operations in Ukraine. 'Under the current conditions, Russia is unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days.'", "a2af42cce453e5ff15db4bc4daba58c3c4cf34315bbdb50a76f9596f": "Plans to shred parts of the Northern Ireland protocol 'would send headlines around the world' that the UK is prepared to break treaties, Ireland's foreign minister has said, as a British cabinet minister insisted the UK did not intend to break the law. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said the UK had 'the right to act in a sovereign way' and to 'reopen or re-examine the protocol' but denied the actions would constitute a breach of international law. Boris Johnson will travel to Belfast on Monday, where he will vow not to scrap the protocol negotiated as part of the Brexit deal, and say he is only seeking reform that has 'the broadest possible cross-community support'. In a move to put pressure back on parties at Stormont, Johnson will urge them to 'get back to work' after the Democratic Unionists blocked the election of a Speaker at the Stormont assembly on Friday, meaning the assembly is unable to function. Signs that the government was rowing back its rhetoric on the protocol came amid mixed messaging over a trade war, with Johnson allies claiming he had a 'conciliatory' call with Ireland's taoiseach last week. However, the Irish Times on Saturday reported Irish sources describing it as 'the single worst call he has ever had with anyone'. On Sunday, Simon Coveney, Ireland's foreign minister, 'criticised sabre-rattling and grandstanding' from ministers over the past week, including reported plans by the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Tuesday for a bill that would unilaterally override parts of the protocol in order to lift checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. Johnson has already been warned that dozens of Conservative MPs will attempt to stop the bill becoming law if it reaches the later stages - though many see it as a negotiating tactic. Coveney told Sophy Ridge on Sky News on Sunday that the behaviour of UK ministers was 'creating a lot of tension in my country, your closest neighbour, and also potentially being on the verge of making a decision that could fundamentally undermine the functioning of the institutions of the peace process in Northern Ireland'. He said the majority of people in Northern Ireland were in favour of the protocol. 'There is a minority, a large minority within unionism, who are unhappy with the protocol,' he said. 'There are solutions that we can put in place that can ease that concern and that's what we need to focus on doing together, as opposed to the British government acting on its own, illegally in a way that doesn't reflect majority opinion in Northern Ireland and perhaps, most importantly, sends a message to the world that this British government when it suits them will set aside international law.' He said that the relations between Britain and Ireland were being fundamentally damaged because of 'unhelpful briefings that we're getting from very, very senior levels within the British government this week'. Coveney said the EU had not threatened any specific retaliation - though several European parliamentarians have said there will be consequences, including the potential suspension of the trade deal, should the UK government act unilaterally. 'There's no way the EU can compromise if the UK is threatening unilateral action to pass domestic legislation to set aside international obligations under an international treaty that, don't forget, the UK was the primary designer of along with the EU,' he said. 'We can get there to a landing zone if we work in partnership. But, you know, sabre-rattling and grandstanding in Westminster ratcheting up tension is not the way to do it.' Kwarteng said the UK had a right to act unilaterally contained within article 16 of the protocol - though sources close to Truss have briefed that invoking article 16 is not the route the government intends to take. 'Political stability in Northern Ireland is our number one priority,' Kwarteng told Ridge. 'We should be able to act in a sovereign way. Northern Ireland is as much part of the United Kingdom as England, Cornwall, the south-east, and we are responsible for that.' He said he did not think there would ultimately be a trade war with the EU and that any imposition of tariffs would be likely to take considerable time. 'I don't think there is going to be a trade war. There has been a lot of talk, a lot of threats about what the EU will or won't do. That is up to them,' he told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme. 'As far as I am concerned, our primary duty as the British government is to look after political stability in Northern Ireland. If that means re-looking at the protocol, we absolutely have to do that. 'I think this talk of a trade war is irresponsible and I think it is completely getting ahead of ourselves. It is up to the EU. We think it would be completely self-defeating if they went into a trade war, but that is up to them.'", "5ee27b131c8be7086568467c24d5fb6e75247bcda745138d1633742e": "", "9fec972c860d5c88f17d6f809a90bdfd096eda8ee8edb1004a544ac9": "Close to the River Teme, in the shadow of the Malvern Hills, with three farm cats playing around our feet, Meg Edmonds is showing me around an old barn that she uses to store, arrange and wrap her flowers. It is busy with colour and life. There are tulips of every shade in crates, narcissi and ranunculi in buckets and vases. There are pots of snakeshead fritillary just outside the door, and a vase of blue and white anemones by the window, in water, so that Edmonds can make a note of how many times they open and close in the sun before they're over. 'I want to be able to tell people that information,' she says. They're currently on number four. She pulls out a huge green stem that looks as if it has been ripped out of Jurassic Park. It turns out to be from an artichoke plant. There are dried artichokes elsewhere, their fluffy innards bursting out, to be used in dried arrangements over winter. We walk around the farm. Edmonds points out shrubs and trees that have ended up in her work, from a sumptuous trailing rosemary bush to the flowering branches of a crab apple tree. Everything here is useful. It has also been grown within walking distance, either on the family farm, or on a patch of land next to the farm shop, at the other end of the village, where Edmonds's flowers sell in big, beautiful bunches. Edmonds and her husband farm livestock and vegetables on his family farm (they are third generation), and converted to organic practices 20 years ago. After moving away from selling the farm's livestock to supermarkets, in favour of selling in their own farm shop, she started to think that there might be a way of doing the same for flowers. 'I didn't realise that there was this burgeoning market for local seasonal, mixed, beautiful things, like I had in my garden and like my friends raved over,' she says. Now she does arrangements for funerals, and occasionally for weddings, as well as the bunches in the shop and at farmers' markets. Flowers are often at the centre of life's biggest turning points, from birth to marriage to death, but, until recently, few would have asked questions about where those flowers came from and what the cost might be, beyond the price tag. 'We ask our farmers to address these questions,' she says. Now, we can find out if meat or veg is organic, and where it was grown, and when. 'But we don't look at the most obvious thing, in the middle of our table, which is the bunch of flowers.' Flowers are big business in Britain: 50% of British households bought cut flowers in 2021. The pandemic disrupted growers and florists, both logistically and when events, such as weddings, ground to a halt, but people still bought flowers to stay connected to family members and friends. The mail-order company Bloom & Wild announced in 2021 that it had doubled its sales during the first year of the pandemic, with customers ordering flowers to send to loved ones as 'somewhat of a substitute for a hug'. But according to Defra, only 14% of cut flowers sold in the UK are grown in Britain. The remaining 86% come from the Netherlands, or from warmer countries, such as Ecuador, Kenya and Ethiopia. In 2016, the National Farmers' Union released an extensive report into the cut-flower industry in the UK, pointing out that the value of British cut flowers has remained largely the same since the late 1980s, rising from PS79m in 1988 to PS82m in 2015, while the value of imported flowers rose almost sixfold over that same period, from PS122m to PS666m. Supermarkets sell 'seasonal' flowers, such as roses in February, without much explanation as to which country's season that is, though it is safe to assume that roses are unlikely to be thriving in the cold British winter months. 'It's the one thing that just doesn't cross people's minds in the same way as it does with food and fashion,' says Olivia Wilson, a florist and grower who co-founded the SSAW Collective, a community of chefs, florists and growers, which advocates for progressive change in the food and flower industries. 'For many years now, people have been able to get roses all year round, but that doesn't reflect what true seasonality means. We've got the opportunity to have flowers that are seasonal and grown in the UK, from April to October or even November. The whole system could be worked differently to ensure that flowers are available, but in ways that are helpful to the environment rather than damaging.' While establishing the true carbon footprint of cut flowers is complex and requires a great many intricate factors to be taken into consideration, from growing conditions to climate to transportation and beyond, there is a simple way to hedge bets when it comes to what is best for the environment. 'Buying from a local farmer is the most sustainable thing you can do,' says Edmonds. There are a growing number of local farmers to choose from. Flowers from the Farm, a non-profit organisation that was established in 2011, has doubled its membership over the past three years, and now works with more than 1,000 independent British growers. (Its website allows you to search for your nearest local flower farmer.) Many grow organically, peat-free and without pesticides, and use paper wrapping rather than plastic. I spoke to several of their members, and they all said that demand for their flowers had exploded. Partly, they put this down to a growing awareness of the environmental impact of the cut-flower industry. Much like food and fashion, there is an appetite for information about provenance and a desire to spend money more ethically, where possible. And in part, there is an aesthetic appeal, helped along by social media, and a trend towards a more bohemian, 'garden-gathered' look, that finds beauty in less-than-straight ranunculi stems, for example, or more unusual varieties of flowers and foliage that a local farmer might specialise in. In 2008, after working as a designer and gardener in private gardens for many years, Rachel Siegfried established Green and Gorgeous in Oxfordshire, a farm over two acres that has flower fields, orchards, vegetable and herb beds, and chickens. She also teaches in-demand courses on floriculture and floristry, which regularly sell out. 'There was the slow-food movement, and the farmers' markets were going strong, and people loved buying their locally grown veg, but you'd go to the market and you'd never see flowers,' she recalls. 'I could count on one hand the number of people I know who were doing it in the UK.' She suspects people just didn't know where cut flowers came from, and in the early days of setting up as a grower, she struggled to find florists who would take her produce. 'I really tried. I went around all my local florists with a van full of beautiful flowers. But they didn't want to know. I remember one having a huge go at me about ants on the peonies,' she laughs. Why didn't they want to know then, when they do now? 'They knew my flowers would be more expensive. And they also knew I could not guarantee consistent supply,' Siegfried explains, though she says Brexit has made importing flowers more costly. Farming in Britain has its particular demands and complications, of course, and that applies to flowers, too. The climate is unpredictable, and global warming has exacerbated its unpredictability. When we spoke, in early April, Siegfried had just had a -5C frost. 'When I'm teaching, one of the main things I say is that you must manage your customers' expectations, because you can't manage the weather.' If she is supplying a wedding, she never promises a specific flower. 'I'm very cagey. I try to work with people's colours. Because of course, at this time of year, flowering time can change by up to a month.' Anais Carrillo-Hawkins is entering her first full season as a grower. A Mexican-American woman, originally from Texas, she had been looking for land to start her own flower farm ever since she moved to the UK 11 years ago. She studied horticulture in Texas and has a family background in farming, but worked in the charity sector for a number of years, for Unicef and Save the Children. During the pandemic, she made the decision to set up Dulce and Flor, combining flower farming and her other passion, baking. The land she farms, in the Chilterns, has its own microclimate, she explains, and one of the biggest challenges has been learning to deal with the local wildlife. As we speak she spots a red kite, which stops her in her tracks: she explains that it could mean that the kite has spotted a mouse. 'It's been a real learning curve, despite having a background in horticulture,' she says. 'It's pretty high risk. In Texas, we had hurricanes that would come in during the summer months, all through your main cropping season. But here it seems as if climate change is getting even harder to predict. When you're working with clients, it's hard to predict when your crop is going to be ready to sell to them.' Imports are probably more reliable, she admits. But buying locally, and seasonally, is about far more than a guarantee of uniform arrangements. Carrillo-Hawkins is adamant that the benefits far outweigh the problems. 'I just really love having that conversation with the client,' she says. 'The flowers I'm harvesting from my field will last so much longer than imported flowers, as they haven't been sprayed. I think the environmental aspect of purchasing from a local farm far exceeds the click-and-collect demand of imported flowers that you can get from wholesalers.' She also points out that the 'garden-gathered' trend means that local suppliers may have an advantage, as they can provide unusual flowers that might not travel well via cargo or freight. 'It's just so beautiful to see those flowers gracing tables, like bearded irises. A lot of those conversations are about memories that people have, of their grandparents having a bungalow with irises, and the different colours. I just really like that avenue, to get people to connect through flowers, to the environment, by having these conversations with complete strangers.' Many of the growers I spoke to sell locally and get to know their customers. 'For a lot of people, it's about connecting with their community,' explains Michelle Owen. Prior to the pandemic, she was an interior decorator and wallpaper designer, but in lockdown, she and her family moved from inner city Bristol to Bridport in Dorset, gaining a much bigger garden in the process. 'Last summer I started growing dahlias, zinnias, all seasonal stuff, and I ended up giving away so many bunches to people, friends and neighbours. And they all loved them, and said, 'I wish we could get flowers like this in the shops.'' She subsequently set up Flower Coast Garden, and is in her first season of growing; she will offer local subscriptions and sell within the area, using paper to wrap bunches, rather than plastic. 'You know, when you get a beautiful bunch of flowers from the garden, they smell amazing,' she says. 'The ones in the supermarket just don't smell the same.' Often, though not always, buying flowers from a local grower will be more expensive than a bunch of daffodils from the supermarket. This turns flowers into a treat, a luxury, and right now, for many, those indulgences may be few and far between. At her farm in Worcestershire, Edmonds urges me to smell the flowers. They have a different, much more vibrant aroma to anything you could find at the supermarket. A lily-flowered tulip smells like oranges. 'Isn't it gorgeous?' she says. Before I leave, I buy a bunch of huge red tulips from the farm shop, 10 stems for PS15, for a friend's birthday that weekend. I had seen where they came from, and the love and work that went into growing them. Each one was as big as the palm of my hand. Several days later, my friend sent me a picture. They were still going strong, and they were gorgeous.", "30d0da996d4ce2277c20b8e04b1eda2f9716ca301a1244d835d43d9c": "", "1ffee6bfae82ef769032f1885bf01502941627c7b03ba71cbbd3889d": "Ten days before she was assassinated outside a Mexican convenience store, Yesenia Mollinedo noticed two mysterious stalkers following her on a motorbike. 'We know where you live, bitch,' one of them warned the journalist, the director of an online news outlet called El Veraz (The Truthful One) whose motto is 'Journalism with Humanity'. For more than a year, Mollinedo, 45, had been trying to shrug off what she hoped were empty threats designed to silence the stories she published about crime in the coastal town of Cosoleacaque. She repeatedly changed her phone number in an attempt to escape the intimidation. 'I don't think anything will happen to me,' Mollinedo insisted when relatives asked about her safety. But at about 1.15pm last Monday it did. As the journalist stepped out of the shop with a rookie colleague, the assassins pounced, firing 16 shots that would end the lives of both women. 'Yesenia didn't owe anything to anyone,' her brother, a fellow journalist called Ramiro Mollinedo, said this week as overwhelmed family members laid her to rest and fretted over their own safety now his sister was gone. 'We don't know who we are up against,' he admitted. Mollinedo and Sheila Johana Garcia were the first of four female journalists to lose their lives in the line of duty last week, a spasm of butchery that has shocked the world. Two days later, the Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh, a veteran observer of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was shot in the face while covering an anticipated Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank. The next day, a 29-year-old Chilean journalist, Francisca Sandoval, died after being shot in the head while covering May Day protests at the start of the month. 'Francisca was the most wonderful mother and daughter,' remembered Gabriel Cardozo, a photographer at Senal 3 de La Victoria, the channel where Sandoval had worked. 'She was one of those people who would always be looking out for you ... How can you express your pain at losing someone with whom you've been through so much?' The deaths of so many journalists in such a short space of time have sparked an international outcry and soul-searching in newsrooms from Mexico City to Doha. 'All we wanted to do was our job,' said Shatha Hanayshe, a Palestinian journalist who was standing next to the respected Al Jazeera reporter when she was gunned down trying to document the Israeli operation in Jenin. 'This will stay with me for the rest of my life,' added the 26-year-old journalist who appears frozen to the spot next to her colleague's corpse in chilling footage showing the aftermath of that shooting. 'There is no need to target us.' Robert Mahoney, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), said each of the shootings was particular and had taken place in different circumstances: 'But there is a common thread here, which is that in 2022 we have seen a real upsurge in the numbers of journalists being killed. 'It is very difficult to draw a direct connection between any of these killings except to say that it has become - and is becoming, I believe - more dangerous to do independent journalism,' Mahoney added. Part of the increase in bloodshed is the result of the outbreak of war in Ukraine, where at least seven journalists have died since Vladimir Putin's invasion on 24 February. Thousands of civilians are also thought to have lost their lives. The stunning surge in killings in Mexico, where local campaigners say 11 journalists have been assassinated since January compared with seven last year, had also contributed to the global rise. 'It's censorship through the gun,' Mahoney said of the wave of organized crime-related killings in the Latin American country whose media-bashing president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has been accused of encouraging the violence with his populist rhetoric. '[It's] killing people in order to send a message ... [and] bring about that real cancer on journalism which is self-censorship: when journalists just stop or comply because it is just too dangerous to do otherwise.' Yet campaigners say the killings are only the most dramatic expression of an increasingly gloomy outlook for media freedom in an ever-more authoritarian world. The Chinese city of Hong Kong - home until recently to a feisty independent journalism scene - has been transformed in just a few years since Beijing's imposition of a draconian national security law. 'There is a now a palpable sense that the fight for democracy and media freedom has entered its endgame,' the International Federation for Journalists warned of China's crackdown earlier this year, describing how many media workers had been jailed or fled the former colony in recent months. Russian journalists faced a clampdown even before this year's invasion of Ukraine, while reporters in Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries - and even democracies such as Viktor Orban's Hungary and Jair Bolsonaro's Brazil - are coming under growing pressure from governments who consider them an irritant. Mahoney said his group was also concerned about the growing online harassment and intimidation of journalists, particularly female ones, around the globe. 'Whether it's in the Philippines or in India, more and more journalists are attacked online and these online attacks can sometimes be a harbinger of a physical attack,' he warned, urging social media companies to take action. The CPJ president, Jodie Ginsberg, said covering protests - as Francisca Sandoval lost her life doing in Chile - had also become increasingly dangerous for journalists. 'Journalists are not being killed in the crossfire any longer: increasingly, they are being targeted,' Ginsberg added. 'In the case of Shireen Abu Akleh, eyewitnesses say Israeli forces shot and killed her while she was reporting and clearly identified as 'press' and this follows a worrying pattern of Israeli forces targeting Palestinian journalists.' The first hints of the danger Mollinedo was facing in Mexico began about 18 months ago, when her crime coverage began attracting a growing number of threats. 'Take the fucking story down or we will fuck you up,' they warned, according to her brother who said she had deleted a series of stories in an effort to avoid trouble. The identity of Mollinedo's killers is a mystery, and is likely to remain so. Activists say more than 150 Mexican journalists have been murdered since the turn of the century with more than 90% going unsolved and unpunished. Valerio Luiz Filho, a Brazilian lawyer whose journalist father was assassinated nearly 10 years ago as he left the radio station where he worked, said the influential perpetrators of such crimes had to be held responsible if anything was to change. Ten years after he found his father's lifeless body in a bullet-riddled car in the city of Goiania, the five suspected killers - who include one powerful local figure - have yet to be sentenced or jailed. 'Justice means showing these people that the thing they took away has value. It means making them understand the value of the thing they exterminated,' Luiz said. 'There has to be justice in these cases, whether it's in Chile or Mexico or wherever ... [so people understand] that the journalists whose lives were stolen are valuable and that their work is valuable too. 'Only justice will send this kind of message,' Luiz said, as thousands of mourners bade farewell to Shireen Abu Aklen more than 10,000km away in Jerusalem.", "50731c4ed7ffb6840d16b14d904c25019ca537969fdc689aff5a1a45": "Maybe it was because she had endured the loss of two longtime partners over the last several years. Or perhaps she feared - if she didn't go through with it - her loved ones would be killed. Whatever the case, James Ballentine hopes there's a good explanation for why his neighbor of nearly 40 years, Vicky White, ignited a romantic affair with an inmate of the rural Alabama jail where she was the assistant director, and helped him escape, before she shot herself to death as police closed in 11 days later and about 300 miles away. It was a story that captured national and global attention. 'That's just not Vicky to do something like that, because of the way she was,' said Ballentine, who grew up across the street from the home White shared with her parents in Lexington, Alabama. 'She wasn't raised that way.' Yet, as police continue investigating how White became entangled in what they called one of the best-planned jailbreaks they had seen, authorities say the evidence is clear. Vicky White wasn't coerced into the plot - she willingly participated. 'You think you know someone,' said the Lauderdale county sheriff, Rick Singleton, whose office runs the jail that employed White. 'And it turns out you really don't know them at all.' The confusion is easy to understand when White, 56, is viewed from the perspective of those in her home town. Ballentine saw a devoted daughter, who spent most of her life residing either in her parents' house or in a home directly behind it. She would help her father pour concrete, which is how he made his living. She would get her parents groceries, clean their house, drive them to the doctor, and take care of repairs around the place. Ballentine, 58, said he trusted her so much that she babysat his son, now 26, alone on several occasions, beginning when he was about six. He ran out of gasoline one time and out of all the people in the world, he called her for help. She promptly showed up and brought him to a gas station, where he filled up a can before she drove him back to the empty vehicle. 'You could rely on her for anything,' Ballentine said. 'Anything.' Another neighbor, Jody King, said White would delight his children with her patrol cruiser, waving as she made its lights flash and sirens blare on her way in to work at the Lauderdale correctional center. 'She was just extremely nice,' King said. Maybe the only other place where White enjoyed such a spotless reputation was at the lockup where she worked for 16 years. White earned supervisor of the year honors at the facility four times, and she was in line for a fifth such award later this month. That illustrated how highly both White's colleagues and even the inmates they oversaw regarded her, according to Singleton. 'She was the kind of employee everyone wanted - if something needed to be done, she was the go-to person,' said Singleton, who has been in office seven years. 'If there was something you needed, she made sure she got it for you.' But White's wasn't a pain-free life. In December 2009, a car crash killed her years-long romantic companion, 49-year-old Bryan Garner. Then, this past January, complications from Parkinson's disease killed her ex-husband Tommy White, 62, with whom she stayed on good terms. Did the heartbreak from both deaths leave her vulnerable to striking up an ill-advised romance? Authorities know they may never get the answer. But many of White's acquaintances can't help but wonder now, especially given what happened after she met Casey Cole White (no relation). By the time Vicky White's path crossed with that of Casey White, he was already serving a 75-year sentence at a prison in Jefferson county, Alabama, after being convicted of breaking into an ex-girlfriend's home in 2015, shooting at her and two of her friends, and killing her dog. He had also shot at police after fleeing in a stolen car and trying to carjack another vehicle, firing at both drivers in the process. Then, in 2020, he allegedly sent a letter to the Lauderdale county sheriff's office confessing that he had broken into the apartment of Connie Ridgeway and stabbed the 58-year-old mother of two to death in 2015, before his imprisonment. The missive prompted Alabama officials to transfer Casey White to the lockup that Vicky White helped run. Authorities have kept mostly mum about precise details, but Singleton has said that sometime after that, Vicky White began showing Casey White preferential treatment, such as by giving him extra food. Casey White, now 38, initially pleaded guilty to the Ridgeway slaying, but then he changed his plea to not guilty, arguing that he was legally insane and therefore not culpable at the time of the killing. Amid the procedural rigamarole, Casey White was transferred out of the Lauderdale county lockup, but then he returned in February of this year, in advance of preliminary hearings centering on his trial in the Ridgeway murder, which was scheduled to get under way in June. Singleton said Vicky White - in the interim - stayed in touch with Casey White, who could possibly be executed if convicted of murdering Ridgeway. The sheriff wouldn't elaborate, but he said investigators have since secured recordings of telephone calls that Vicky White made to Casey White when he was temporarily transferred out, and they establish that the two had linked up romantically. As the end of April neared, Vicky White suddenly started talking about moving to the beach and quitting the job from which she never took sick days or vacation time. She briefly moved in with her parents nextdoor after selling her home on 18 April for $95,550 - far below the $235,600 that the Lauderdale county government estimated her property was worth. And she initiated the process to retire from the sheriff's office, scheduling her last ever shift for 29 April. One of Vicky White's last moves on the job was to send a total of 12 inmates and five deputies under her command to court in two transport vans. It left her as the last employee at the correctional center who was authorized to transport inmates, Singleton said. Vicky White took advantage of her suddenly solitary position, put Casey White in her patrol cruiser, and told her remaining colleagues that she was taking the imposing 6ft 9in detainee to a mental health evaluation at court. Only officials later realized there was no such evaluation scheduled, and neither Vicky nor Casey White ever made it to court. And if anyone knew that traveling alone with an inmate was against jail policy, it was Vicky White, Singleton said. The sheriff experienced a wide range of emotions as the hours passed and there was no sign of the Whites. At first he feared Casey White had somehow overpowered his trusted jail aide and forced her to help him escape. But, relatively quickly, it became clear those fears were unfounded. Authorities spotted Vicky White's patrol cruiser abandoned at a nearby shopping center. Surveillance then showed them getting into and driving off in a 2007 Ford Edge sport-utility vehicle that Vicky White had just bought under an assumed identity, apparently with the money she made from offloading her home. Casey White even had a change of clothes on hand. As word spread of the inmate and jail guard who apparently ran off together, other detainees at the lockup came forward and told investigators that the Whites had been engaging in a romantic relationship. Investigators in part used the recordings of the calls that Vicky White made to Casey White to confirm that information as true, Singleton said. Within hours of their disappearance, Singleton's deputies had obtained a warrant to arrest both Vicky White and Casey White, launching a huge manhunt that drew assistance from the US Marshals Service, the nation's elite fugitive catchers. Vicky White's mother, Patricia 'Pat' Davis, went on a local television station and pleaded with her daughter to come home, describing her shock to viewers. She had never heard of Casey White, and her last conversation with her daughter was a mundane one about her dog, the mother recounted. 'I thought at first it was a mistake,' Pat Davis told WAAY-TV. 'And then when I found out for sure it was [not], it was just disbelief.' Despite her mother's supplications, Vicky White didn't come home. She and Casey White ditched the Edge in a community in Tennessee about two hours north of Lauderdale county and left in a Ford F-150 pickup that her money also apparently bought. By 4 May, they ditched the truck at a car wash in Evansville, Indiana, about 270 miles from Lauderdale. Investigators used car wash surveillance video to determine that they had gotten into a Cadillac, a third getaway vehicle which Vicky White's money had seemingly purchased. At this point, the US marshal in charge of the manhunt, Marty Keely, said it became obvious the Whites' escape plot was unusually well planned. 'Typically with escapes, they have a plan to get over the fence, but once they're on the outside, they're not very organized,' Keely said. Crediting it to Vicky White's intimate knowledge of jail operations, Keely said: 'This was much more organized than you typically see.' Officers canvassed Evansville for signs of the Cadillac, finally seeing it at a local motel. They staked out the motel and spotted Casey and Vicky White emerging from the room where they were apparently trying to lie low. The pair got into the Cadillac and took off when police tried to stop them. A 15-minute car chase ensued. It ended with an officer ramming the Cadillac into a ditch, where it turned on to its side. The crash activated equipment in the car that automatically alerted 911 to the wreck. Emergency dispatchers listened in on - and recorded - a panicked Vicky White speaking to Casey White. 'Oh my God ... Casey,' Vicky White says on the recording. 'Airbags are going off. Let's get out and run. Get us back to the fucking hotel! ... Casey.' Soon after, Vicky White aimed a gun at her head and shot herself. The recording picked up the voices of officers approaching the wrecked car after Vicky White had turned her gun on herself. 'She's got a gun in her hand, and she's breathing,' one of the voices said. 'Her finger is on the trigger.' There were handguns, a rifle, ammunition magazines and $29,000 in cash, but Casey White didn't try to run any more. He surrendered, asking officers to help his 'wife', who had shot herself in the head. There's no evidence that the Whites ever married, but officials said the remark starkly illustrated how close the two had become. Officers arrested Casey White and brought Vicky White to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Officials said an autopsy examination performed on Tuesday confirmed she died by her own hand, despite speculation from some that Casey White had possibly killed her and then tried to lie. Casey White has since been returned to Alabama for the Ridgeway murder trial and to face charges in connection with his near two-week escape. Meanwhile, Vicky White's family held her funeral Saturday in Lauderdale county. About 200 mourners - colleagues, friends and loved ones - gathered at a local cemetery to pay their final respects. Vicky White's mother and father, JC Davis, went back to their home after the burial. The dad stood in his garden and briefly spoke with the Guardian, saying the size of the turnout for the funeral was a small comfort, showing how much their community respected his daughter. He declined to say much more as his wife waved him back into the home. 'We'll let it go with how it's been going,' he added, clad in an undershirt and jeans. 'I couldn't believe what happened at all. I'll tell you that.' Minutes later, lifelong Lexington resident Amy Crunk dropped by Vicky White's gravesite, adorned with an array of fresh flowers. Crunk said she stopped by because her late brother was best friends with Vicky's brother, and JC had poured concrete jobs for her and much of the rest of her family. 'If somebody dropped a bomb (here), I don't think it would be as big a shock as this,' Crunk said. 'Because they're such a good family, everyone wants to find a reason. We're trying to figure out why she did what she did. She made a mistake. Yes, she did wrong. But everyone is sad for her family and what they're going through.'", "a374c0b289f99dc666c3bb29d79b78464406491177d683698a23e29d": "It was Nina's 88th birthday, and she marked it by leaving behind everything she had known. Volunteers, not particularly young or fit themselves, carried her down three flights of stairs from her flat, past the irises about to bloom in her neighbour's patch of garden. Apartment buildings hid the ruins of the local school, destroyed last week by a Russian missile, but the war intruded on the yard anyway, the regular thump of distant artillery echoing through the sunny afternoon. This corner of Donbas is one of the few parts of Ukraine still threatened by an advancing army, and fear has largely emptied the town of Konstiantynivka of its families. Defeated in Kyiv, pushed back from Kharkiv, Moscow has thrown its anger and many extra troops into long stretches of the eastern front. Targets are pulverised by artillery and airstrikes, then Russian soldiers move forward a few miles and declare the 'liberation' of places such as Popasna - more ruin than town when it was captured, survivors say. 'There is no Popasna now,' said Oleh, a construction worker who had tried to ride out the fighting in a basement shelter with his family until their own home was hit. 'Even when you look at photos and videos, your brain can't understand what you are seeing. It's hard to know that this is where you lived.' Residents of places that might be next have been urged by government and relatives to leave while it is still possible, advice that many heeded weeks ago. Driving through the region is a journey through ghost towns, with empty streets of shuttered shops, deserted homes and abandoned parks. An eerie quiet interrupted only by air raid sirens or explosions hangs over these half-abandoned communities - from Bakhmut, the last major Ukrainian-held outpost before the frontline at Popasna, west to Kramatorsk, site of a bloody attack on civilians waiting for an evacuation train, or south through Druzhkivka to Konstiantynivka. Only the hospital trauma wards are bustling, filled with the terrible shrapnel wounds of a war waged mostly by rocket and artillery, bringing severed limbs and lacerated bodies. Those who gambled on staying - hoping the Russians won't arrive or their homes won't be hit - are mostly the old, the sick and the poor, who can't physically leave, fear they can't afford to live somewhere else, or simply can't face starting again somewhere new so late in life. 'I'm too old for this,' said Oleksandr, 67, his face crumpling into tears as he waited to be driven away from his home of 33 years, with his wife, Tanya, 64. He is a stroke survivor who can barely walk, and his daughter had badgered the couple into accepting an evacuation offer from Druzhkivka before they become trapped there by a rain of Russian shells. 'I'm a little scared,' Tanya admitted. 'We've been hearing heavy bombing for a week now, there was one last night.' As she waved goodbye to a few hold-out neighbours, all retirees like themselves, one woman in sandals asked how she could get on the list for a ride. Like so much of the civilian response to the Russian invasion, this evacuation is an unlikely and improvised effort run by volunteers willing to risk their lives for strangers. They help those who are too ill to leave in ordinary cars, or can't afford to pay for their own travel, or are daunted by the logistics of fleeing across a country at war. Vlad is driving the lead car, finding addresses given to him by a local Ukrainian charity, Vostok SOS, and reassuring the evacuees. Mark Poppert, an American who has left his home in Doha to volunteer with the UK-based charity, Refugease, is at the wheel of a van that serves as a rudimentary ambulance for evacuees who can't sit up. They have already called at Druzhkivka to collect Oleksandr and Tanya; now the makeshift convoy has arrived in Konstiantynivka.  Poppert wears a Stetson as a nod to his Nebraskan roots. 'So the Ukrainians know they have international support,' he says, although it is unclear how many locals pick up on the gesture of solidarity. The two men use Google Translate to communicate, because they have no shared language to manage their urgent shared mission. Russian bombs are not the only threat residents of these small towns are trying to balance. The pressures of war have thrown daily life into chaos and made people vulnerable in other ways. Nina and her daughter Irena, 60, were both being treated for cancer at Kramatorsk hospital, but with the Russian advance their doctors left and the oncology ward was shuttered. Nina's grandson Anatoly, 43, is disabled and Irena is clearly frantic with worry about what the interruption to her treatment could mean for him. 'We had no relatives to help us organise healthcare,' said Irena. 'My mother is paralysed and can't talk, but we couldn't even get any painkillers. We are going to Dnipro now: someone said they will help us get into hospital there.' After Nina is carried down the stairs by their rescuers, she is laid carefully on a bedding roll spread on the floor of Mark's van, her head protected by pillows, for the two-hour drive to a special evacuation train leaving from Pokrovsk. Signs in the windows read 'invalids', more for the railway guards than for Russian attackers. When the convoy arrives, everyone on the platform is slightly nervous, after last month's strike on nearby Kramatorsk station. For many of those climbing on board, this escape from immediate danger will be the most painful but straightforward step in a long and difficult journey towards some kind of new life. Also in Vlad's car are Irina, five months pregnant, and her nine-year-old daughter Amina. 'I was afraid to be alone with a child on the way, they said the town was being encircled and we should leave,' said Irina, after making a final reading of the gas meter and handing the key of her rented flat over to her landlady. She leaves behind an aunt who is like a mother to her, a job at a local gas company, and - like all the others who are going - the only place she has ever called home. Pregnant and with a child, she is striking out into the unknown with little more than a phone number of a friend in Poland. 'She said we could stay, I'll call her when I get near Warsaw and she will give me the exact address,' she said. Charities have been warning about the trafficking of women like Irina, vulnerable and alone, as they cross into Europe. The risks of this journey into the unknown is one reason some stay near the frontline. 'We have relatives in the west, but we don't have any job. How will we support ourselves when we get there?' said Oleh, who drove his wife, son, daughter-in-law, two granddaughters and their cat through heavy shelling to Bakhmut. After the intense battle for Popasna, the ghost towns of Donetsk seem like something of a haven, and they have free beds in a shelter, so they plan to stay in Bakhmut for now, despite a steady increase in shelling. 'One recent hit was on a student dormitory. Children had been playing there half an hour before, but fortunately they had just left,' said Bakhmut deputy mayor Maksym Sutkovyi. He estimates that at least a third of the town's prewar population of about 100,000 have stayed, a number swelled by people escaping from fighting to the east. 'Of course I'm worried: we understand that the war in its next phase can come here,' he said, but he plans to stay, along with the rest of the town council. 'Those who stay need basic living conditions, and we have to maintain critical infrastructure ... people will better support our army and country if we are here.'", "e0097a440d0ee708400b3a4ee4befd8ba4a949c6582e1846ba41d46f": "As Buffalo, New York, mourns the victims of a mass shooting at a supermarket Saturday that left 10 dead and three wounded, details are emerging about the shooter's movements before the attack and how the devastating racist attack unfolded. The 18-year-old shooter, who is a self-confessed white supremacist, shot 11 Black and two white victims in a 'racially motivated hate crime' authorities said. It plunged the mostly Black Buffalo East Side neighborhood into grief and shock. But the plotting of the attack happened many miles away, had likely been in development for months and even apparently involved a reconnaissance of the targeted area. The shooter is believed to have traveled about 200 miles (320km ) from his home of Conklin, New York, to Buffalo but signs of trouble had surrounded him for some time. One year ago, he was the subject of a law enforcement investigation, according to The Buffalo News. High school authorities in Broome county, New York called the police in June 2021, claiming that he had 'threatened violence in comments made to fellow students'. 'A school official reported that this very troubled young man had made statements indicating that he wanted to do a shooting, either at a graduation ceremony, or sometime after,' the newspaper reported, citing a government source. The state police were dispatched to investigate and he was referred for counseling and a mental health assessment. Officials have said that the shooter purchased his gun legally in New York. He did not purchase the high-capacity magazine in this state, they said. The purported shooter recently purchased a Bushmaster XM-15, an assault weapon in the style of an AR-15, from Vintage Firearms, a gun shop in Endicott, New York, the New York Times reported. Robert Donald, the store's owner, told The Times that he conducted a background check on the alleged shooter, and that nothing turned up. 'He didn't stand out - because if he did, I would've never sold him the gun,' he told the newspaper. A lengthy racist manifesto surfaced online after the shooting, and the writer's name matches that of the alleged shooter. The text indicated that the writer planned his steps 'down to the minute', including diagrams inside the Tops Friendly Market. This manifesto, the validity of which has not been confirmed by authorities, said that the supermarket was selected because the postal code had the highest percentage of Black people close to where he lived, WIVB reported. The author stated that he had considered such an attack for several years, but started planning in earnest this January. Meanwhile, police say that the shooter 'was in the Buffalo area at least the day before'. 'It seems that he had come here to scope out the area, to do a little reconnaissance work on the area before he carried out his just evil, sickening act,' Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said on This Week With George Stephanopoulos. Buffalo's mayor, Byron Brown, further described the gunman's alleged reconnaissance in an interview with CNN. 'It sounds like he was here for maybe several days from reports that I've been hearing and that he did surveil this community, was scouting the supermarket, actually talked to some people in the area,' Brown said. The shooter arrived at Tops around 2.30pm, authorities said. He wore military garb and body armor, as well as a 'tactical helmet', according to ABC News. His rampage began in the store's parking lot. Video shows him arriving at the store with a gun on the front seat. He then trained his gun on people in the parking lot, as he exited his vehicle, and started shooting. 'He had a camera that he was livestreaming what he was doing,' police commissioner Gramaglia, told reporters. He shot four people outside the store, local prosecutors said. Three died. The gunman then entered the grocery. Aaron Salter, a recently retired Buffalo police department lieutenant, shot at the gunman in an attempt to stop him. While Salter was able to hit the shooter, he was protected by his tactical gear, authorities said. The shooter killed Salter. The gunman then shot eight more people inside of the grocery. Six died, and two were injured, prosecutors said. Four victims worked at the store, authorities said. Buffalo police arrived at the store and confronted the shooter inside the vestibule. 'At that point the suspect put the gun to his own neck. Buffalo police personnel - two patrol officers - talked the suspect into dropping the gun. He dropped the gun, took off some of his tactical gear, surrendered at that point. And he was led outside, put in a police car,' Gramaglia said. The shooter appeared in court hours later, where he wore a white hospital gown. He was arraigned on one first-degree murder count, and was held without bail. He pleaded not guilty. Meanwhile, scores of law enforcement agents arrived at the shooter's parents home, where he lived, hours after the shooting, according to WIVB. The shooter's parents were cooperating with authorities.", "0f88339b84d42c214b8464e15e51a704f2772aaeb7152efcd48c1f7d": "Kim Jong-un has criticised North Korea's pandemic response and ordered the army to help distribute medicine, state media said Monday, as the country said 50 people had died since first reporting an outbreak of Covid-19. More than one million people have been sickened by what Pyongyang is referring to as 'fever', state media said, despite Kim ordering nationwide lockdowns in a bid to slow the spread of disease through the unvaccinated population. After two years denying North Korea had any cases of Covid-19, last week officials confirmed that there had been a Covid outbreak in the country. In a sign of how serious the situation may be, Kim 'strongly criticised' healthcare officials over their response to epidemic prevention - specifically a failure to keep pharmacies open 24/7 to distribute medicine. He ordered the army to get to work 'on immediately stabilising the supply of medicines in Pyongyang', the capital, where Omicron was detected last week in North Korea's first official reported cases of Covid-19. Kim has put himself front and centre of North Korea's disease response, overseeing near-daily emergency politburo meetings on the outbreak, which he has said is causing 'great upheaval' in the country. The failure to distribute medicine properly was 'because officials of the Cabinet and public health sector in charge of the supply have not rolled up their sleeves, not properly recognizing the present crisis,' said Kim, according to state media KCNA. Kim, who visited pharmacies to inspect first-hand, 'strongly criticised the Cabinet and public health sector for their irresponsible work attitude,' said KCNA. North Korea has one of the world's worst healthcare systems, with poorly equipped hospitals, few intensive care units, and no Covid treatment drugs or mass testing ability, experts say. 'While visiting a pharmacy, Kim Jong-un saw with his eyes the shortage of medicines in North Korea,' Cheong Seong-jang, researcher at the Sejong Institute told AFP. 'He may have guessed but the situation may have been more serious than he had expected.' KCNA said that as of 15 May, a total of 50 people had died, with 1,213,550 cases of 'fever' and over half a million currently receiving medical treatment. North Korea had maintained a rigid coronavirus blockade since the pandemic began, but with massive Omicron outbreaks in neighbouring countries, experts said it was inevitable Covid would sneak in. Kim's public criticism is a sign that the situation on the ground is grim, said Yang Moo-jin, professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. 'He is pointing out the overall inadequacy of the quarantine system,' he said. Kim has previously said the country will 'actively learn' from China's pandemic management strategy, according to KCNA. China - the world's only major economy still maintaining a zero-Covid policy - is battling multiple Omicron outbreaks with lockdowns in some major cities, including financial hub Shanghai, sparking increasing public frustration. North Korea has previously turned down offers of Covid vaccines from China and the World Health Organization's Covax scheme, but both Beijing and Seoul have issued fresh offers of aid since the outbreak was announced. North Korea is likely to need international assistance to get through the massive Omicron surge, Yang said. 'If China's assistance is not enough to overcome the outbreak, North Korea will ask the South, the United States or international organisations in the end,' he said. US President Joe Biden is set to visit Seoul later this week, with discussions of Pyongyang's weapons programs and Covid-19 outbreak likely to top the agenda.", "e424f6c3689d903728d6b18ba912cde645ec11136f28a5855e62ccdd": "", "8ddd14103a22eb8db9f7f9692bd041adf07c241b26a39751fdba212b": "", "0c992850e8e3a5eec4d49cc68561f0a604eeae22d0cbbe580c0a0a57": "", "8b15e6611fb7954af120fa63a31964bfabb0d24f85a81875a6ab0eb0": "Sweden's ruling Social Democrats said on Sunday that they backed the country joining Nato, abandoning decades of opposition in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and creating a large parliament majority in favour of membership. 'The party board has at its meeting on May 15, 2022 decided that the party will work toward Sweden applying for membership in NATO,' the Social Democrats said in a statement.  With Finland already set to hand in its application, Sweden's prime minister Magdalena Andersson is now all but certain to launch a formal application within days, Reuters reports. The air force command of the Ukrainian armed forces reported that today Ukraine hit 11 Russian air targets: two helicopters, seven Orlan-10 UAVs and two cruise missiles.  Meanwhile, the joint forces task force reported that Russian forces fired at 23 settlements in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, destroying and damaging 32 residential buildings.  Ukrainian forces fought off 17 attacks in this region today, destroying three tanks, one artillery system six units of combat armored equipment and one enemy vehicle.  As the war shifts away from Kyiv, the surrounding areas have begun to clean up and return to some form of normalcy. In Bucha, a city whose people suffered unspeakable atrocities, life goes on amid the rubble.  Kalush Orchestra, the band that won Eurovision for Ukraine last night, will auction off the statuette and donate the proceeds to a charity fund that helps the Ukrainian army and Ukraine. 'Many people are already donating from abroad, and perhaps many more would like to donate. And this, in our opinion, will be the thing that motivates them. We think it will be beneficial for Ukraine,' band leader Oleh Psiuk said. Adding more fodder to claims that Russian forces are flagging in Ukraine, Ukrainian forces reached the Russian border today: Ukraine's ministry of defense has estimated that since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, Russia has lost about 27,400 troops, 200 planes, 1,220 tanks and 164 helicopters.  Today in the Donetsk region:  The latest from British military intelligence is that Russia may have lost as much as a third of the invasion force it sent into Ukraine.  This comes amid reports that Russia will be sending in reservists and more than 400 Russian soldiers were estimated to have been killed or wounded last week trying to cross the Donets river.

But the smiles of relief beamed out when the family - mum, dad and three children - stepped into arrivals hall to be greeted by a welcome banner, goody bags and the warm hugs of their host, retired teacher Cora Hall, who has opened up her Staffordshire home as part of a new refugee sponsorship programme. 'I'm so full of emotions,' said the mother, Iryna, 34. 'But most of all, I'm extremely happy to be here. Cora seems very kind and the children are pleased to be in Britain.' Her husband, Vladyslav, 37, kept the children, eight-year-old Hlib, Tymofii, 11, and Valeriia, 14, close and repeated one of the few English phrases he knew to anyone and everyone: 'Thank you.' The new end-to-end scheme - Communities for Ukraine - is based on a collaboration between two charities, Citizens UK and Ukrainian Sponsorship Pathway UK. USPUK, set up by lawyers and entrepreneurs, employs Ukrainian staff in Poland to support refugees exploring resettlement in the UK. Citizens UK, the community organising charity that helped pioneer the UK's sponsorship scheme for Syrians, has recruited 20 civil society organisations with deep roots in their communities as strategic partners. Each partner - mainly faith groups and educational establishments - has committed to finding 50 hosts, and Citizens UK gives training to ensure that the matches are solid and sustainable. The status of the scheme has been recognised by the UK, but the ambition is to provide a safer, more streamlined, better-supported system than the government's much criticised response tothe refugee crisis. On the evening before their departure for the UK, Vladyslav and Iryna finished their packing at a refugee hostel in Krakow and spoke of their sadness at having to flee their home in the city of Pavlohrad, central eastern Ukraine, and their hopes for their life in the UK. 'We couldn't believe it when the war started,' said Vladyslav, who was a senior manager in a construction firm. 'We knew our area would be one of the first to be affected.' At first they stayed put, heading into bitterly cold bomb shelters when the sirens sounded and the missiles hit. 'They said that only strategic sites would be targeted,' said Iryna. 'But there were rocket attacks in our neighbourhood that hit civilian areas. It was very, very scary. We felt we had to leave.' Vladyslav was allowed to accompany his family because he and his wife have three children, so they packed a few belongings into their car - along with their pomeranian - and drove west, arriving in Poland three days later, at the start of March. 'We went to a refugee centre,' said Vladyslav. 'They offered us accommodation for a month and said the war would be over and we'd be able to go back home.' It quickly became clear that there would be no quick end to the conflict. 'We realised there are so many Ukrainian people in Poland that there was not going to be any opportunity to work and we were not going to be able to progress. We decided to apply to go to another country.' The family has been living in two small rooms. It has been cramped but they have been luckier than refugees living in tents in Krakow or in a disused shopping mall, where about 300 are living in a strip-light-illuminated limbo. Iryna said they were now desperate for the children to go to school. 'They didn't have proper schooling for two years because of Covid - and then war came.' The family has never left Ukraine before and had not flown until this weekend. In the days before they departed, they were in touch with their host via email, asking about subjects ranging from the weather and the cost of food to Vladyslav's job prospects. He is desperately keen to work. 'The UK feels like a dream country,' said Iryna, 'something you read about in books. We never imagined we'd go there.' They said a difficult goodbye to their dog, which is being cared for by relatives in Krakow, and to the friends the children had made at the hostel. At Krakow airport, the family were waved off by Little Amal, the giant puppet of a Syrian girl created to draw attention to the plight of refugees, on to their flight, which was funded by the Shapiro Foundation. Cora Hall, who was taking part in the Communities for Ukraine scheme through the Birmingham Catholic social care agency, Father Hudson's Care, had borrowed a school minibus to take them from Luton to Staffordshire. 'I'm excited and nervous,' she said after meeting the family. 'I'd told myself not to hug them, to give them some space when they arrived, but I couldn't help myself when I saw them. It seemed the natural thing to do.' She has been researching schools, banks and the location of other Ukrainian families and has stocked up on the family's favourite foods. She knows the neighbours will descend with cakes and offers of help. 'We can do this,' she said. 'Together, we'll make it work.'", "7e990f8a21e921bfc1afd978799fb40d4e171b3abcb3cab34b14fc09": "On Saturday night, far from the ruins that were once homes and the battlefields that were once cities, Ukraine secured an emphatic victory that had nothing to do with rifles, antitank weaponry or Molotov cocktails, and everything to do with hopeful words, folkloric dance moves and a continental eruption of cultural solidarity. Following the Kalush Orchestra's triumph in the 2022 Eurovision song contest, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he hoped next year's final would take place in the besieged port city of Mariupol, which has endured some of the most merciless onslaughts of the Russian invasion. 'Our courage impresses the world, our music conquers Europe! Next year Ukraine will host Eurovision!' Zelenskiy said in a Telegram post. 'We will do our best to one day host the participants and guests of Eurovision in Ukrainian Mariupol. Free, peaceful, rebuilt! I am sure our victorious chord in the battle with the enemy is not far off.' Kalush Orchestra's entry, Stefania - a rap-folk hybrid originally intended as a tribute to the mother of frontman Oleh Psiuk - swiftly proved a rallying cry in Ukraine and beyond. As the song's lyrics, which include the lines 'I'll always find my way home, even if all roads are destroyed', found new resonance, the group rededicated it to all Ukraine's mothers. Many Ukrainians felt Stefania's triumph had provided a much-needed psychological boost after almost three months of war. In a basement north of Kyiv, a group of soldiers watching the event also dared hope that next year's final would be in Mariupol. 'We had a victory - today in Eurovision, but soon we will have a victory in Ukraine-Russian war,' said Tetyana, a military medic, standing in the basement decorated with children's paintings of the Ukraine flag and 'Glory to Ukraine' signs. The tired-looking but happy soldiers had sat around a screen, some tapping rhythmically on their knees while Kalush performed, and when the winner was announced they clapped and cheered with delight. 'We will also win,' said Vitaliy, another soldier. 'We have shown that we can not only fight, but we can also sing very nice. The next Eurovision we will host in liberated Mariupol.' For Mykola Latsiuk, a bartender in Kyiv, the band's decision to take part in the contest was more important than their victory. The six men who make up the group had received special permits to leave Ukraine and travel to Italy during the war. 'The most important thing is that the guys went and performed,' said Latsiuk. 'They supported us, and we supported them. It is important.' The track's success will also live on in the name of a train that runs between Kyiv and Ivano-Frankivsk. The head of the railway service announced on Sunday that the number 43 train would be renamed the Stefania Express, and that stations in Kyiv, Kalush and Ivano-Frankivsk would play the song when the train rolled in. Kalush released a new music video for the track on Sunday, which showed Ukrainian servicewomen rescuing children from shelled and ruined towns. Psiuk's mother, the eponymous Stefania, said she had been startled by her new-found celebrity and by the requests for photos when she went to her local market. 'I didn't connect it to myself - that the song was written for me,' she said. 'I thought someone had made a mistake and meant his girlfriend Sasha and got the names mixed up.' Psiuk's sister Iryna described watching the final with her mother in the band's home town of Kalush, which lies in the foothills of the Carpathian mountains in Ukraine's western Ivano-Frankivsk region. 'She was really worried,' said Iryna. 'We wept. We sat up until half past six, watching the press conference ... Emotions were off the scale, we didn't believe that our little town of Kalush would bring Ukraine victory this year in the Eurovision.' Psiuk himself took advantage of the global stage to make an impassioned plea to free the fighters still trapped beneath the sprawling Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. 'Help Azovstal, right now,' he said. The European Broadcasting Union, which organises the contest, said no action would be taken against the band for using the stage to make a statement. 'We understand the deep feelings around Ukraine at this moment and believe the comments of the Kalush Orchestra and other artists expressing support for the Ukrainian people to be humanitarian rather than political in nature,' the EBU said. Stefania had been bookmakers' favourite among the 25 competing performers in the grand finale. The public vote from home, via text message or the Eurovision app, proved decisive, lifting them above the British TikTok star Sam Ryder, who led after the national juries in 40 countries cast their votes. The 439 fan votes is the highest number of televote points ever received in a Eurovision contest, now in its 66th year. Psiuk thanked the Ukrainian diaspora 'and everyone around the world who voted for Ukraine', adding: 'The victory is very important to Ukraine. Especially this year.' Psuik told journalists the group wanted to 'show that Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian music are alive, and they have their own and very special signature'. One of the band's original members had stayed to fight, while the others will be back in Ukraine in two days when their temporary exit permit expires. Before traveling to Italy, Psiuk was running a volunteer organisation he set up early in the war that uses social media to help find transport and shelter for people in need. 'It's hard to say what I am going to do, because this is the first time I win Eurovision,' he said. 'Like every Ukrainian, I am ready to fight and go until the end.'

Police said the attacker shot 11 Black and two white victims before surrendering to authorities in an assault he broadcast on the streaming platform Twitch. Later, he appeared before a judge in a paper medical gown and was arraigned on a first-degree murder charge. He pleaded not guilty. In a statement, Biden said: 'We still need to learn more about the motivation for [the] shooting as law enforcement does its work, but we don't need anything else to state a clear moral truth: A racially motivated hate crime is abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation.' Biden added: 'Any act of domestic terrorism, including an act perpetrated in the name of a repugnant white nationalist ideology, is antithetical to everything we stand for in America. Hate must have no safe harbor. We must do everything in our power to end hate-fueled domestic terrorism.' Vice-President Kamala Harris said she was heartbroken by events. 'What is clear is that we are seeing an epidemic of hate across our country that has been evidenced by acts of violence and intolerance. We must call it out and condemn it,' she said. The suspected gunman in Saturday's attack on Tops Friendly Market was identified as Payton Gendron, of Conklin, New York, about 200 miles (320km ) south-east of Buffalo. It wasn't immediately clear why Gendron had traveled to Buffalo and that particular grocery store. A clip apparently from his Twitch feed, posted on social media, showed Gendron arriving at the supermarket in his car. The gunman shot four people outside the store, three fatally, said Buffalo police commissioner Joseph Gramaglia. Inside the store, security guard Aaron Salter, a retired Buffalo police officer, fired multiple shots. A bullet hit the gunman's bulletproof armor but had no effect, Gramaglia said. The gunman then killed the guard, the commissioner said, then stalked through the store shooting other victims. Police entered the store and confronted the gunman in the vestibule. He put his rifle to his own neck, but two officers talked him into dropping the gun, Gramaglia said. As Buffalo and the rest of the US began to mourn, details about the shooter and hours preceding the attack have started to emerge. The shooter had been under 'medical' supervision for something he wrote in high school, authorities said. He arrived in Buffalo at least one day prior to the mass shooting, to conduct reconnaissance, police said. Gramaglia said on This Week With George Stephanopoulos that the shooter 'was in the Buffalo area at least the day before'. 'It seems that he had come here to scope out the area, to do a little reconnaissance work on the area before he carried out his just evil, sickening act.' 'This is the worst nightmare that any community can face, and we are hurting and we are seething right now,' Buffalo mayor Byron Brown said at the news conference. 'The depth of pain that families are feeling and that all of us are feeling right now cannot even be explained.' Twitch said in a statement that it ended Gendron's transmission 'less than two minutes after the violence started'. A law enforcement official told the Associated Press that investigators were looking into whether he had posted a manifesto online. Buffalo police declined to comment on the document, circulated widely online, that purports to outline the attacker's racist, anti-immigrant and antisemitic beliefs, including a desire to drive all people not of European descent from the US. It said he drew inspiration the man who killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 and also called for the killing of London mayor Sadiq Khan. The video posted online also seemed to show a racial slur written on the weapon used. During an interview on This Week, New York governor Kathy Hochul was asked: 'Had he been on the radar of law enforcement at all?' 'Just as a high school student with respect to something he wrote in high school and was under the surveillance at the time with medical authorities,' Hochul said. Brown told CNN that 'from reports that I've been hearing and that he did surveil this community, was scouting the supermarket, actually talked to some people in the area'. Hochul said authorities believe that he 'targeted the busiest place at one of the busiest times'. CNN noted that this mirrored a line from the shooter's seeming manifesto; the writer, claiming to be the shooter, allegedly wrote: 'Zip code 14208 in Buffalo has the highest black percentage that is close enough to where I live.' Federal agents were also interviewing the shooters' parents and had served multiple search warrants. The parents were reportedly cooperating with investigators. It also emerged that he had last year threatened a shooting at his high school and been sent for mental health treatment and an evaluation at hospital. An official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that the suspect made comments following his arrest that showed clear hatred against the Black community. 'The alleged shooter made it known he was targeting the Black community during the statements,' the network paraphrased this official as saying. 'Tonight, the country mourns the victims of a senseless, horrific shooting in Buffalo, New York. The FBI and ATF are working closely with the Buffalo police department and federal, state, and local law enforcement partners,' US Attorney General Merrick B Garland said in a statement. 'The justice department is investigating this matter as a hate crime and an act of racially-motivated violent extremism.'Among the dead was Ruth Whitfield, the 86-year-old mother of a retired Buffalo fire commissioner. 'My mother was a mother to the motherless. She was a blessing to all of us,' former Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield told the Buffalo News. Community members gathered outside the Tops on Sunday morning for a prayer vigil. 'This was domestic terrorism, plain and simple,' New York's attorney general, Letitia James, said at the True Bethel church in Buffalo. 'He was fed, each and each day, a steady diet of hate,' James also added. At the same church service, Hochul reportedly said: 'I will say one thing... Lord forgive the anger in my heart.' Hochul said that the shooter's gun, an AR-15, was purchased legally in the state. 'The gun was purchased in a gun store in New York state legally, an AR-15. But what has made this so lethal, and so devastating for this community, was the high-capacity magazine that would have had to have been purchased elsewhere, that's not legal in the state of New York,' Hochul told CNN.NAACP President Derrick Johnson issued a statement in which he called the Buffalo shooting 'absolutely devastating'. 'Hate and racism have no place in America,' he said. The Rev Al Sharpton called on the White House to convene a meeting with Black, Jewish and Asian leaders to demonstrate a federal commitment to combating hate crimes.

Tatchell, who has been campaigning for gay rights and equality since 1967, had been invited to attend the pageant outside Buckingham Palace as one of more than 100 'national treasures'. But he declined, stating his lifelong republicanism and also that: 'To my knowledge, [the Queen] has never publicly acknowledged that LGBT+ people exist. The words lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender have never publicly passed her lips and she has never visited or been a patron of any LGBT+ charity.' He added: 'To be ignored for 70 years feels like a deliberate snub.' In a letter to the platinum jubilee co-chair, the former publishing titan Nicholas Coleridge, Tatchell also claimed that for many years palace staff were prohibited from bringing same-sex partners to the Christmas ball. He wrote that 'after the 1999 Soho gay pub bombing, which killed three people and injured over 70 others, the Queen did not visit the scene or the victims in hospital'. The pageant is due to take place on Sunday 5 June and will feature more than 10,000 participants - including members of the royal family - parading through the streets of Westminster and along the Mall to Buckingham Palace. For the finale, Coleridge invited Tatchell to be among an 'ensemble of over one hundred 'National Treasures' to join us as we pay tribute to Her Majesty'. He explained that national treasures 'means the celebrated, respected and admired people from many spheres - theatre, film, television, music, literature, sport, the sciences and business'. In an interview with the Guardian, Tatchell said the pageant was 'propaganda for the anti-democratic system of an unelected and unaccountable head of state'. He added: 'To join the celebration of the Queen's reign would give legitimacy to an elitist and anti-LGBT+ monarch.' He said he also objected to the royal family because of the way future monarchs are chosen, with 'the first-born of the all-white Windsor family' ascending to the throne. 'For the foreseeable future no black or brown Briton, no matter how worthy, can be made head of state,' he said. Tatchell said he planned to spend the jubilee weekend talking about trans rights at the HowTheLightGetsIn festival in Hay-on-Wye, Wales.

The 20-year manhunt for one of the world's most brutal killers came to a decisive end in an overgrown cemetery outside Harare, but Zimbabwean authorities say they did not conceal his whereabouts. 'As a law-abiding nation, Zimbabwe will never harbour criminals and welcomes findings from the DNA samples extracted from the fugitive,' foreign affairs minister, Frederick Shava, said in a statement on Sunday. He added that the government of Zimbabwe cooperated with UN investigators into Mpiranya's case. 'The government of Zimbabwe wishes to clarify some recent media reports that are circulating insinuating that the government was harbouring the most wanted Rwandese fugitive, Protais Mpiranya, whose remains were allegedly found in Zimbabwe under the alias Ndume Sambao,' the statement read. The body of Mpiranya, a former commander of the Rwandan presidential guard indicted for genocide, lay buried under a stone slab bearing a false name, which UN investigators tracked down and identified with the help of a lead found on a confiscated computer - the hand-drawn design for Mpiranya's tombstone. His remains were exhumed last month at the request of UN investigators, and his identity was confirmed by DNA analysis on Tuesday. Zimbabwean authorities insist that they cooperated with the investigation by the organisation charged with tracking down fugitive criminals, the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT), adding that Zimbabwe joined a taskforce to coordinate the inquiry. 'From day one, Zimbabwe cooperated fully with the investigation team,' the statement read. 'The Zimbabwean authorities have consistently cooperated and adhered to the country's international legal obligations.' Authorities in Harare said they were involved in the exhumation of Mpiranya's remains and authorised DNA samples to confirm his identity. However, the government's claim will raise some eyebrows among those who have followed the search. Investigators have long suspected the fugitive of hiding in Zimbabwe and have made repeated attempts to persuade local authorities to hand over Mpiranya, investigate his activities or provide evidence of his death. As early as December 2010, investigators reported to the UN security council that Mpiranya had connections with Zimbabwe and had lived there for long periods. In 2012, under pressure from Kigali, Zimbabwean authorities admitted that the fugitive could be on their territory and pledged to find him 'dead or alive'. The question of his presence in Zimbabwe was discussed in parliament, and local media listed possible aliases and addresses associated with him. Officials from the IRMCT travelled to Zimbabwe months after President Robert Mugabe was forced from power in November 2017 in the hope that the new government would prove more helpful. However, in 2020, Serge Brammertz, prosecutor of the IRMCT, told the security council that despite credible evidence of the whereabouts of key fugitives, the lack of cooperation from governments remained a challenge, particularly in east and southern Africa. According to the IRMCT, Mpiranya fled to Zimbabwe in 2002, where his entry was facilitated by local officials. He then brought associates and family to Zimbabwe, along with a series of 'trusted subordinates'. For four years, Mpiranya was able to avoid arrest in Zimbabwe, where he resided in an affluent area of Harare, and 'continued his engagement with Zimbabwean military officials' while also receiving a series of visitors from overseas.", "38c8c1710a0289e76246e92b7d749fdda3d2522dc1e58e32d2273b5a": "A British man has claimed the record for the most ascents of Mount Everest by a foreigner after standing on the summit of the world's tallest mountain for the 16th time. Kenton Cool from Gloucestershire reached the top of the mountain in Nepal early on Sunday morning, according to a post on his Instagram page. The 48-year-old's initial push for the summit was delayed due to high winds, which forced his team to wait below the peak. Many Nepali guides who help tourists to climb the mountain have completed substantially more ascents of Everest. The current record-holder is Kami Rita, a Sherpa who last week climbed the mountain for the 26th time at the age of 52. In an Instagram post, Cool paid tribute to the local guides, who he said had 'worked super hard on our behalf', calling them the 'superheroes of the mountain'. Cool has previously climbed Everest with other mountaineers including Sir Ranulph Fiennes and the broadcaster Ben Fogle. He was told he would never walk again unaided after he shattered both heel bones in a rock-climbing accident in 1996. He defied those predictions with a year of surgery and therapy, but still suffers from chronic pain. Speaking to the PA news agency via satellite phone ahead of the final leg of the climb, Cool said conditions were looking good, with a 'great weather forecast' and a 'great team'. 'Overconfidence on a mountain like Everest is a dangerous thing, so nothing is assured until you're back down at base camp,' he said. May is the most popular time to climb the world's highest peak, and the Nepali government has issued 316 permits to climb Everest during the current peak season, according to Reuters. The large numbers of people trying to complete the ascent in a short period of time has previously resulted in negative coverage of queues to reach the top - and of the debris left behind by some mountaineers. But the mountaineering industry also brings in substantial income for Nepal and supports thousands of jobs in the region around Everest, which was hit hard when global tourism collapsed during the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Kathmandu Post, as many as 150 climbers made it to the top of Everest in a day last week, including a group of black climbers who were taking part in an expedition designed to improve diversity in the mountaineering industry.", "c065c8b3062e9dfe004d37a3f47c89819d5eee78324b5e7d5dc4cb85": "", "ccff74640f9aeea7a0d73eff0ae6c9075e5ad1a984f59e32adf8120a": "Warnings that a new statue of Margaret Thatcher would attract egg-throwing protests came true within two hours of it being installed in her home town of Grantham on Sunday. The bronze statue was, without ceremony, placed on a 3-metre (10ft) high plinth to make it more difficult for protesters to inflict any damage. Shortly afterwards a man was seen throwing eggs from behind a temporary fence and, when one connected, a cry of 'oi' could be heard. The egg-throwing came as a surprise to nobody in Grantham. There is pride but also heightened awareness of how divisive a figure Thatcher remains. After it was installed on a warm Sunday morning, a number of people stopped to take selfies. But loud booing could also be heard from passing motorists. The Labour councillor Lee Steptoe said the egg-throwing was 'absolutely inevitable'. 'The statue was always going to be a prime target for petty vandalism and political protest. She was the most divisive prime minister probably in history and certainly in my lifetime,' he said. He added that now the statue was up, the challenge was to 'concentrate on the cost of modern-day Tory policies which are driving millions of people to food banks'. Councillor Kelham Cooke, the Conservative leader of South Kesteven council, said the statue was a fitting tribute to a unique political figure. 'Margaret Thatcher will always be a significant part of Grantham's heritage,' he said. 'She and her family have close ties with Grantham. She was born, raised and went to school here.' He added: 'It is, therefore, appropriate that she is commemorated by her home town, and that the debate that surrounds her legacy takes place here in Grantham. We must never hide from our history, and this memorial will be a talking point for generations to come. 'We hope that this memorial will encourage others to visit Grantham and to see where she lived and visit the exhibition of her life in Grantham Museum. 'This is about inspiring, educating and informing people about someone who represents a significant part of Grantham's heritage.' The statue, made by the sculptor Douglas Jennings, was originally intended to stand close to parliament but it was rejected by Westminster council in 2018. Councillors said it was too soon after her death, in 2013. They would also have been aware of the attack in 2002 on the marble statue of Thatcher in the Guildhall Art Gallery in London. It was attacked with a cricket bat and decapitated with a metal bar in what a protester called 'an act of satirical humour'. A court found him guilty of criminal damage and jailed him for three months. After Westminster's refusal, the statue was offered to Grantham, with work to achieve that spearheaded by Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), the educational charity that manages the museum. It has been a rocky road. There was horror when it was revealed that a PS100,000 unveiling ceremony was being planned. A Facebook group proposed an 'egg-throwing contest', which attracted 13,000 expressions of interest. That event was abandoned and in strikingly low-key fashion the statue was lowered into place on Sunday morning. An official unveiling by the Public Memorials Appeal (PMA), which funded the PS300,000 statue through public donations, would take place at a later date, the council said. Graham Jeal, a trustee of GCHA, said there had been a long conversation in Grantham about having a permanent memorial to Thatcher. 'The delivery of the memorial has secured the museum for the next few years and has helped the museum finances survive the Covid pandemic,' he said. 'It is recognised that the full spectrum of views exist in Grantham about the legacy of Margaret Thatcher and an exhibition inside the museum illustrates this.' The statue has been placed in St Peter's Hill Green, close to the museum and the site of the grocer's shop owned by Thatcher's family. Lincolnshire police confirmed it had received reports of criminal damage to the statue but no arrests had been made and inquiries were ongoing.", "ff7b5f96dc16ce384e1fb015c600c7997008773e1c1d6333dd73c398": "It sounds like an idyllic job-share for two mums - Vicky looked after Emily's newborn so she could interview for the job they both wanted, while Emily covered for Vicky when she was settling her child into school. But these are not ordinary part-time roles - Vicky and Emily, who cannot reveal their real names for security reasons, are responsible for the entire counter-terrorism mission at GCHQ, the UK's security and intelligence agency. The pair, who are marking the end of their first year in the role, have described their top-level job-share to the Guardian as their 'superpower', which doubles their output and efficiency, and ultimately makes the UK a safer place. The first women to jointly lead the counter-terrorism mission at GCHQ as deputy directors, Vicky and Emily made the decision when Vicky's baby was just a few months old in May 2020, with Emily covering both roles until Vicky finished her maternity leave. The women, who this week topped a list of the most successful people working part-time compiled by flexible-working specialists Timewise, sketched out the logistics in a series of responses over email. They both work 3.5 days, crossing over on one day. Their classified and unclassified inboxes are shared - people don't know which of them is responding. 'What we love about it is the partnership we have,' said Vicky. 'On a daily basis we are facing new and complex issues. Having a rock-solid support network makes it easier, far more enjoyable and ultimately pays dividends to GCHQ's biggest intelligence mission.' Asked if they needed to be friends to make it work, Emily said: 'It's somehow more than friendship, as we are so committed to each other professionally and personally - it's all about faith and trust.' The pair met while working in the US, a decade before they thought about sharing a job. Professionally, they each valued the other's ability to cut to the chase and solve complex or contentious issues, but after having children, they realised they also had a shared set of values and experiences. 'People have said we bounce off each other as we both have so much energy, it's like the output is doubled - that's our superpower as a job-share,' said Vicky. A poll commissioned by Timewise to mark 10 years of the part-time power list found that half the UK public still 'don't believe it's possible to have a part-time career' (down from three-quarters in 2012) while nearly half (48%) said they 'would not give a part-time colleague an important or business critical task'. ONS data analysed by the consultancy shows that 750,000 people work part-time in senior level and business critical jobs in the UK. Vicky and Emily say that having two heads across hugely complex and diversifying terrorism threats enables them to stress-test vital decisions. 'We double up on creativity and ability to spot risks and opportunities - which is really essential in our line of work,' said Emily. It is far from easy. Playing a key role in keeping Britons safe gives them a 'huge sense of pride', but a weighty burden of responsibility. 'Our teams can feel the weight of personal guilt, grief, and failure for real-world events outside their control,' said Vicky. 'It's critical for us to support them.' But sharing the job means, despite the demands of the role, they are able to see their kids and even - on the odd occasion - have time to think. 'It allows the thoughtful part of your brain to step up,' said Emily. 'And it really helps you ruthlessly prioritise.' They guard their own, and each other's, home time fiercely with a 'very high threshold' needed for them both to attend an event. 'Non-working days are untouchable,' said Vicky. 'We both have young children and owe it to them and each other to make sure we role-model. We don't want to be advocates if in reality it's not possible to achieve.'", "1899d10e1c80c4b3119f9b15c4369f8b6fc8738eff16ed814aa1c361": "", "22736f241fb63f5dca8ca51758e072c9489d3e35ddf4520addd4a83f": "", "0cd7dc693b399ed3db257d70f365ed93ee30c72b9e2f6d047812fe2c": "", "d175024e7fb3133fc0b9f2ea6161743f9a32815c9df3ddff6cd77f1a": "", "b00f9969e44744f821fad3d36bb9805db4ce0756b2e909cc51ed7af9": "I'm listening to BBC Radio 1, where they are interviewing the 26-year-old actor and singer Dove Cameron about her globally successful hit, Boyfriend. The DJ, Melvin Odoom, asks her, 'Do you think that your acting career has helped you with, kind of, like, your music career?' 'For me they're, like, the same energy,' replies Cameron. 'Which is, like, when people are, like, 'You have to choose,' I'm like, 'They feel the same!'' It's the most predictable celebrity interview exchange ever uttered, remarkable only for one word that repeats and repeats. 'It's a really funny one,' says Fiona Hanlon, who has worked at the station for more than 10 years, including producing Nick Grimshaw's breakfast show and Maya Jama's weekend show. 'If a guest says 'like' too much, we'd get texts from the listeners. If a DJ says it too much, sometimes a boss might pop in and mention it ... It's just seen as a bit lazy, a bit dumb. I was always very aware of it.' Why do people have such a problem with 'like'? Is it because it simply won't go away? In 1992, Malcolm Gladwell wrote a robust defence of the word and the way it carries 'a rich emotional nuance', responding to what had already been a decade of criticism. This did nothing to settle the debate. Linguists agree that usage of the word has increased every year since then, to the point where in one five-minute exchange on Love Island in 2017, the word was uttered 76 times, once every four seconds. By the time I was at secondary school in the early 2000s, 'like' was just a natural part of speech. Transcribing the interviews I did for this piece, I say it constantly. When I do, I find it a friendly crutch, signalling to the person I'm talking to that we're having a spontaneous and unrehearsed conversation, that I'm listening and thinking. But despite its long history and widespread use, for many it remains enraging. Politicians, educators and business leaders have complained it makes speakers sound stupid. When Michael Gove was education secretary in 2014, he used an update to the national curriculum to require students to speak in 'standard English', even in informal settings, in all British schools. This reinforced the idea that there was only one right way to speak English. By 2019, one primary school head in Bradford, Christabel Shepherd, said she banned the word because, 'When children are giving you an answer and they say, 'Is it, like, when you're, like...' they haven't actually made a sentence at all. They use the word all the time and we are trying to get rid of it.' Nick Gibb, then schools minister, praised the decision and said others should follow suit. Scores of recruitment specialists and public-speaking coaches have publicly bemoaned the word's rise and say those who use it prevent themselves from getting opportunities. One law firm in America sent a memo to just its female employees and told them: 'Learn hard words,' and 'Stop saying 'like'.' Peter Mertens, an associate at PR firm Burson Cohn & Wolfe, has said: 'There is nothing that will [lead you to being] dismissed more quickly than a few too many 'likes' during a meeting or on a call.' There's even an app, LikeSo, recommended by businesses, which listens to your speech and promises it can stop you using the word. In the UK, this chorus is made louder by a group of mostly old and white celebrities and Spectator columnists who crusade against its use. In 2010, Emma Thompson complained to the Radio Times that she 'went to give a talk at my old school and the girls were all doing their 'likes' and 'innits?' which drives me insane... I told them 'Just don't do it. Because it makes you sound stupid.'' Gyles Brandreth, writing in the Oldie (where else?), complained that 'like' was 'the lazy linguistic filler of our times' and 'very very irritating'. Why is it so detested? 'Well, humans have an innate tendency to judge. People who are very liberal in other aspects of things, who would never judge someone based on race or sexual orientation or whatever, still have this thing about language,' says Carmen Fought, professor of linguistics at Pitzer College. 'They want to freeze it and they want to judge it. I absolutely guarantee you that in Shakespeare's time, there was some schoolmaster walking around saying, 'Don't say 'soothe' Portia, that sounds so tacky, say 'For soothe.''' There's certainly an element of sexism here and the detractors of 'like' say it makes you sound girlish and stupid, arguing that this is a newish tic said mostly by women and that it's a meaningless 'filler' word that doesn't add anything to a sentence's meaning. But they are, in fact, wrong on every count. The first point is that 'like' isn't just a filler word. It's actually an incredibly versatile and dynamic word. The linguist Alexandra D'Arcy, who wrote a book on the word, outlined its many uses. There are its traditional uses as a verb, 'I like the smell of what's cooking' and a preposition, 'This tastes like it was made in a restaurant'. Then there are the ones that are the subject of scorn. The first of these is the quotative 'like': 'He cooked a spag bol for me last night, I was like, that's delicious.' It allows you to tell a story without promising complete accuracy. Indeed, one of the most enjoyable things about this kind of 'like' is that you can tell an anecdote that makes you sound wittier and more erudite than you actually are because you're not promising exactly what was said but the feeling of what was said. The other hated 'likes' are as a discourse marker, 'What did I do last night? Like, had dinner, hung out'; an adverb to mean approximately, 'It was super quick to cook, like 30 minutes', and what's known as a discourse particle, which goes in the middle of a phrase, rather than at the end of it, 'This dinner is like the best I've eaten.' But there are more uses than that, for example the Geordie tradition of finishing sentences with a like. 'He cooked dinner for me, like,' and increasingly 'like' is also used as a noun because of Facebook and Instagram, 'I gave it a like.' Many of these uses often overlap in a way that is incredibly rich. If you say, 'He was like, seething about the pasta sauce,' you are quoting someone's reaction, but at the same time highlighting you are approximating their response, while pausing to highlight that you are thinking meaningfully about this reaction in real time. That one word is doing all those jobs, all the while creating a sense of familiarity between you and the person you're talking to. The word's incredible flexibility is nothing new either. Most people think the word 'like' dates back to the 80s, as typified by the Frank Zappa song Valley Girl, in which his daughter, Moon Zappa, impersonates a California bimbo, ad-libbing that: 'I, like, love going into, like, clothing stores and stuff, I, like, buy the neatest miniskirts and stuff. It's, like, so bitchin.'' But it goes much further back. In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, written at the start of the 17th century, Valentine says to Cesario, 'If the Duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced.' The linguist Anatoly Liberman says that this version of 'like' was being used as a shorthand for likely, and may be the beginnings of our contemporary usage. 'Consider the following,' he writes. ''All these three, belike, went together' (1741, OED). Take away be-, and you will get a charming modern sentence: 'All these three, like, went together.'' Belike meant 'in all likelihood'. It's easy to imagine how this use of 'like' could transform into like being used more generally as a way to break up speech. Perhaps it was aided by the Irish, Liverpudlian and Geordie use of the word to mean roughly 'or thereabouts'. Or by the beat poets of 1950s, who would often start the sentences with 'Like' (interestingly, fewer people now complain that these more masculine uses sound stupid, despite the fact they could also be described as filler words). It's true that young women in the 1980s probably invented the quotative 'like', but they are far from the only group to use it now. And research suggests that the discourse particle 'like', the one that comes in like the midpoint of a sentence, is used more by men than women. But the biggest lie about 'like' is that it's stupid; that it adds nothing to the meaning of a sentence. 'People say language is random. But language is almost never random. You can't just stick that like in anywhere,' says Fought. 'So for example, if I say, 'Oh look at that boy over there. He's wearing a top hat. And he's like, 10.' That makes perfect sense. But if you say 'How old is your brother'? And I say 'He's like, 10' that's a little more unusual. Or if I said, 'My, like, grandma died.' That'd be a very strange context to hear it. So there's patterns. There's ways to do it more grammatically.' More than being internally logical, it is also a way of signalling. 'It helps with what we call focus. I'm showing you this is the important part, this is the part that connects, it can be for interpersonal connection, it's checking in that you and I are connecting. It's an incredibly useful part of speech. If it really were meaningless and had no purpose in a sentence, it would be much easier for us to leave it out.' This is what I think when I listen to Radio 1 or watch vlogs by young women like the TikTok star Emma Chamberlain or Billie Eilish, both of whom are heavy 'like' users. They have this almost instinctual way of using language not just to convey meaning but to convey a moment around that meaning. It's almost, like, magic. Fought adds that although the debate around 'like' can be fun, when it comes to teachers punishing children for saying the word there are more serious impacts. 'There's nothing more non-conducive to learning and contrary to the purpose of education than constantly shutting kids down because of how they talk. If you want to teach a kid to practise having different language styles, that's fine. But to demean and criticise the way someone speaks in any situation is very, very harmful.' So if linguists are largely agreed that 'like' is, at least in some contexts, no bad thing, why does society still bristle at it? Katherine D Kinzler, the author of How You Say It, a book about linguistic bias - which she argues is one of the most persistent prejudices in our society - says that taking someone to task for the way they speak is one of the last societally accepted ways to exercise our prejudices. 'Most people aren't even aware this is something they might do. For example if you're interviewing candidates for a job, it's easy to think you're not being biased, racist or sexist, that you're just looking for a good communicator. But so many of our perceptions of who is a good communicator can be infused by other forms of biases that we're not aware of.' Kinzler says that 'like' is a good example of a word where young women are chastised for talking a certain way even though that isn't borne out in the linguistic data. ''Young and female' is often the group that is associated with a lot of these vocal features, but actually you find lots of people in the population speak this way. It's a similar thing with uptalk, ending your sentence by going up, like it's a question? It's also assumed that it's a Valley girl way of speaking when in fact it occurs with lots of different groups.' In 2014, a mother wrote to the advice columnist in this magazine with a dilemma. 'My adult daughter is clever, pretty and confident. However, she cannot stop saying 'like' about six times in every sentence... I know it is not the end of the world, but it makes her sound stupid and uneducated, which she most definitely is not, and when she wants to return to the real world I worry this will be held against her.' I hope she would take some comfort in knowing that the best linguistic studies today suggest people who say 'like' may actually be more intelligent than those that don't. One, published in the Journal of Language and Social Psychology, which examined 263 conversational transcripts, found that 'conscientious people' and those who are more 'thoughtful and aware of themselves and their surroundings' are the most likely to use discourse markers such as 'like'. As Fought says, 'I'm 55, I have a PhD, many people would consider that to be a sign of intelligence, and I'm a 'like' user. So this judgy thing, it's natural, but it's really not helpful.'", "abd5522153f1d250ce4be2e65c665ead9df5e6897a2018d524411e76": "", "30e500be09cf8146139de8d4011e4bfa30b323f6cc78c7bfef186523": "", "df8c74d5d854568c5781bb0c6d5fa1b99d97475965bc1513234e624d": "", "de04c83c9996a883e5d83a1731da831337d5a921d04f7ff62f934a70": "", "56194d65532f9b944412c65863419cf7c039c3b8b28bfe1da3ee7997": "", "8fb83c41e3708cdb797d8ad9034ca345483e339b7f7e1393036d4b4c": "", "8f0d9c89a70c3bcacf9056f9e550fe05865fd13dbafaac81efb12e43": "", "7c61e979988e00cf55a49b789c043a6cd920cbbde3145c6240733f17": "The tumult of war and climate breakdown has proved lucrative for the world's leading oil and gas companies, with financial records showing 28 of the largest producers made close to $100bn in combined profits in just the first three months of 2022. Buoyed by oil commodity prices that soared following the turmoil caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, major fossil fuel businesses enjoyed a bonanza in the first quarter of the year, making $93.3bn in total profits. Shell made $9.1bn in profit from January to March, almost three times what it made in the same period last year, while Exxon raked in $8.8bn, also a near threefold increase on 2021. Chevron upped its profits to $6.5bn and BP reveled in its highest first-quarter profits in a decade, making $6.2bn. Coterra Energy, a Texas-based firm, had the largest relative windfall of the 28 companies, with a 449% increase in profits on last year, to $818m. The rocketing profits, at a time when inflation has surged in many countries, has prompted several of the companies to return billions of dollars to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends. Ben Van Beurden, chief executive of Shell, said that the company's performance 'has been helped by the macro and the macro has been impacted by the war in Ukraine'. He added that this situation means 'we do have a better company, we do have a better performance, and yes indeed our shareholders will benefit from that as well'. Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief financial officer, said in February: 'Certainly, it's possible that we're getting more cash than we know what to do with.' Climate campaigners, however, have called the profits 'obscene' and argued that the provision of fossil fuels would not be so lavishly rewarding if governments had acted properly to confront the escalating climate crisis. 'The greed of these companies is staggering,' said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, an advocacy group. 'We've heard their executives bragging about how much the agony of inflation and the tragedy of the war in Ukraine has allowed them to raise prices. These profits are going right into their pockets.' While the oil companies contend that they do not themselves set the global price of oil, the surge in profits is jarring given scientists' warnings that the world should be rapidly phasing down its use of fossil fuels if it is to avoid unleashing catastrophic heatwaves, drought, sea level rise and other worsening consequences of the climate emergency. The wealth of the oil and gas industry also highlights how there is still far more money flowing from the destruction of a livable climate than there is from efforts to maintain it. The 28 large oil and gas companies made a combined $183.9bn in profits in 2021, a sum that dwarfs several major, but floundering, climate measures. Wealthy countries have promised, but so far failed to deliver, $100bn a year to developing nations to help them cope with climate impacts, while the largest piece of legislation in US history to combat the climate crisis, which would have cost about $55bn a year over the next decade, was scuttled due to opposition from Republicans and the pro-coal Democratic senator Joe Manchin. The International Energy Agency has said that there can be no new oil or gas fields, or coal mines, if the world is to reach net zero plant-heating emissions by 2050. Nearly two-thirds of all identified oil and gas reserves will have to stay in the ground to avoid the planet breaching a 1.5C temperature rise above pre-industrial times, a threshold beyond which will cause compounding disasters, according to scientists. A huge tranche of new 'carbon bomb' oil and gas projects is in train from industry, however, that risks blowing apart international climate goals, to the dismay of high-profile advocates. 'Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness,' Antonio Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations, said in April. 'Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.' In the US, the mounting profits have irked Joe Biden, who has complained that gasoline costs faced by drivers have remained elevated despite a recent cooling off in oil prices. The president's Democratic allies in Congress have proposed a new windfall tax for oil firms that would be used to send payments to Americans affected by rising cost of living expenses. 'Never content to let a crisis go to waste, oil executives are taking advantage of the international situation by using their windfall profits to juice their own pay and pursue share buybacks,' said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator who has spearheaded a bill that would impose the tax. 'We should be clawing back big oil's excessive profits and sending them to the Americans who paid exorbitant prices at the gas pump.' Most of the large oil companies now have their own climate goals, such as Exxon's pledge in January to cut its own emissions to net zero by 2050. However, these promises are mostly centered on emissions coming from the operations of drilling and transporting oil and gas, rather than their actual use by consumers, which constitutes the lion's share of pollution. Few companies are reporting on their investments in clean energy, such as wind or solar power, or efforts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Those firms that do cite these figures reveal that such climate-friendly investments are a very minor sideline, typically just a few percentage points of overall budgets. 'We are seeing investment in these things but the levels aren't meeting the science-based trajectory we need to be on to align with 1.5C,' said Simon Fischweicher, head of corporations and supply chains at CDP, a non-profit that helps companies disclose their environmental impact. CDP has estimated that the oil industry would have to invest three-quarters of its capital expenditure into low-carbon technologies if disastrous climate change is to be avoided. 'There is a significant gap between what needs to happen and what is being promised,' said Fischweicher. 'We haven't seen the commitments in renewables that match the ambition required. I just haven't seen any of these companies commit to net zero for the use of their products. There's a lot more to do.'", "20b03864ff86f79791d8e0bad11d710d0c22fc5f2eb71f33c11715ca": "More than one million people have died in the Covid-19 pandemic in the US, according to Johns Hopkins, far and away the most deaths of any country. While the sheer number of deaths from the coronavirus sets the US apart, the country's large population of 332.5 million people does not explain the staggering mortality rate, which is among the highest in the world. For every 100,000 residents, 291 people have died from Covid-19, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. Among the 20 worst affected nations, only two other countries - Brazil and Poland - have higher mortality rates per 100,000 people. Deaths directly attributable to Covid-19 are only one measure of the pandemic's toll. Deaths from drug overdoses hit a record high in 2021, killing at least 100,000 Americans. Chronic conditions such as heart disease, hypertension and dementia have contributed to the number of 'excess deaths' - a number which includes other ailments exacerbated by the pandemic, as well as those deaths caused directly by Covid-19. This number crossed the one million threshold in mid-February. The extraordinary toll has set the US apart among wealthy, peer nations, exposing inequality, a unique and fragmented health system, and polarized politics - all of which likely made the crisis worse, researchers said. 'In terms of understanding why we had such a bad experience from the pandemic, we have to think about the systemic issues that already were in place when the pandemic arrived,' said Steven Woolf, a social epidemiologist and population health researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University. 'And, on top of that, mishandling of the pandemic by the government and by the public, frankly.' The pandemic shone a light on longstanding racial and ethnic health disparities, as Black, Latino and Native American people were infected, hospitalized and died of Covid-19 at rates that were, at times, double those of white Americans. The drivers of those outcomes - the disproportionate likelihood for people of color to lack the same quality housing, employment and healthcare access as white Americans - are well known and documented. Such disparities are the 'intended or unintended consequences of policy decisions', a recent commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association said. The US has nonetheless had difficulty correcting course. Vaccines were at first slow to reach minority, low-income and rural areas. One recent study has shown how at least one advanced Covid-19 therapy, monoclonal antibodies, were the least likely to reach the highest risk patients for whom they are recommended. 'It just exacerbated the struggles we currently have and pulled back the curtain on all the issues we've been dealing with for so many years,' said Terrence Shirley, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Mississippi. Community health centers help treat indigent and marginalized Americans who cannot pay for healthcare. The all-consuming nature of the pandemic has also allowed preventable and treatable infectious diseases to flourish. Thousands of young children, particularly in low-income households, have fallen behind on routine vaccinations. Rates of sexually transmitted diseases have reached the 'highest numbers in American history', as overwhelmed and underfunded local health agencies reallocated resources to Covid-19. Meanwhile, the mental health of adolescents in particular has suffered, as millions were cut off from the mental health services provided by schools. Pediatricians, children's hospitals and psychiatrists declared a mental health crisis among the nation's youth, and a recent CDC study has shown how emergency room visits for eating disorders has increased dramatically among adolescent girls. Millions of children were also thrust into food insecurity, as the numbers of children receiving school meals plummeted. Missed academic time appears to have caused the educational achievement gap to widen. 'The US has been experiencing worse health outcomes for some years now. Life expectancy in the US is the lowest of any high income country,' said Woolf. 'There's a set of reasons for it, but all of those rolled right into the pandemic.' However, America's reliance on an expensive, private and exclusionary health system is not solely to blame. Although policies that exclude 28 million uninsured individuals from healthcare have likely made things worse, they are only one example of how fragmented policy has worsened Americans' health. Concepts fundamental to US governance also proved problematic in the pandemic. In just one example, the US Constitution makes public health the responsibility of individual states, creating a patchwork of different pandemic responses. Culture and environment also appear played a role. Americans are more likely than citizens of other countries to engage in what public health researchers consider risky behavior, such as gun ownership, smoking, consuming more calories and exercising less. Polarized politics make it more difficult to implement guardrails on these behaviors. Floundering responses by federal, state and local governments compounded existing issues, and eventually allowed pandemic-related public health guidance to become political and cultural footballs. Less than two-thirds of Republicans have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, compared with 91% of Democrats, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's January 2022 vaccine tracking poll. The only thing both parties appear to agree on, according to the same poll, is how the pandemic has exhausted them. That has led to another riddle - as more and more pandemic prevention measures are dropped, Americans will be faced with how to live with a disease that can be chronic and disabling, even if it isn't as deadly. 'Death is not the only serious outcome from Covid,' said David Putrino, the Director of Rehabilitation Innovation for Mount Sinai Health System. Putrino has seen thousands of cases of so-called 'long Covid', where many varied and at times severe symptoms persist for months. A recent analysis by the Center for American Progress found the syndrome resulted in an estimated 1.2 million more disabled people in 2021. 'We are addressing the acute illness,' said Shirley, 'and not resolving the issues that could prevent the illness in the first place'.", "a70a08ee013c5aec7ad71beebc728d0f3bef6aad9935ac3f0e4de93c": "Labour activists in Durham have called on a Conservative MP to withdraw allegations made to the police, accusing him of presenting misleading evidence about Keir Starmer. The move was backed by the dean of Durham University's law school, Prof Thom Brooks, who said the evidence provided by the Conservative MP Richard Holden in a letter to Durham constabulary appeared to have been proven incorrect. The chair of the City of Durham Labour party, Sheila Williams, said the allegations were 'wasting police time', including referring to a quiz and social event as being in-person when there was reference to a Zoom link. Police are investigating claims that the Labour leader broke Covid-19 rules at a gathering of staff at Durham Miners' Hall during an election campaign in April last year, where a takeaway was ordered and Starmer was filmed drinking a beer. Labour has claimed the food was necessary for staff who were eating while they worked, and has compiled evidence for police that work continued until later that night. However, at least one witness has told the Guardian they are certain Starmer himself did not continue working in the hall after finishing the takeaway curry. The investigation by Durham constabulary will hinge on whether the gathering of campaign aides and staffers from the local MP's office was necessary for work. Starmer has said he will resign if he receives a fixed-penalty notice. Holden has been a key figure in highlighting apparent inconsistencies in Starmer's version of events around so-called Beergate. The Tory MP previously published one letter he sent to Durham constabulary, in which he claimed to have two new pieces of evidence for them to investigate. The first was a Facebook invitation to a quiz and social on the night Starmer was filmed, which Holden said 'clearly shows' a gathering was intended to take place. The other was a Facebook message from the Labour MP for City of Durham, Mary Foy, who encouraged members to have a 'greasy night', which Holden said was a slang term for drinking too much. He said that it 'appears to link the event to images of Keir Starmer drinking beer on the evening in question'. He said the messages suggest 'a pre-planned in-person social event ... attended by the leader of the opposition'. However, in a furious letter to the Tory MP, Williams, the chair of City of Durham Labour party, said members were being unfairly maligned and police provided with misleading information. Williams said 'greasy' was 'clearly a typographical error' where Foy had meant to type 'great' and that the spelling error was pointed out on the Facebook post itself. She said the invitation to the quiz and social also made it clear a Zoom link would follow. 'You have accused me as chair ... and other officers of party of wilfully and purposefully conspiring to breach the Covid lockdown regulations that existed at that time. You, by implication, have accused all our members who attended that event of breaking the law,' she wrote. 'If you had carried out even the most basic investigations, you would have discovered that you were wasting police time by asking them to investigate whether or not Keir Starmer attended the event ... You brazenly did this knowing you had no evidence to prove your assertion to the chief constable.' Williams demanded a 'full and unequivocal apology' from Holden and said he should tell the police that his report was 'based on conjecture'. Brooks, the Durham University law professor, said: 'The 'new' evidence of a possible breach is nothing of the sort. It concerns an online event held within the rules and raises no questions to answer. I expect the police will find no merit in these allegations when their investigation concludes.' Brooks, who has previously campaigned for the Labour party, said he did not believe Durham constabulary would find that Starmer had broken the rules. 'It was no breach of lockdown rules at that time to host an online event as described. Nor is it a breach of lockdown rules at that time for those working together during an election campaign to have a meal,' he said. Holden said Durham constabulary themselves said they had received 'significant new evidence' about the Labour leader's movements that evening. He added that there had been a number of inaccuracies in Labour's own version, including the presence of the party's deputy leader, Angela Rayner. 'It's vital that important questions are answered too, after clear inaccuracies - such as who and the number of people present and the nature of the gathering - were made by the Labour party and Labour leader at earlier points,' he said. 'Fundamentally, it is vital that the words and actions of the leader of the opposition receive the same scrutiny and inquiry as the actions of those he has spent the best part of a year focusing his efforts on have received. Given there is now an ongoing police investigation, I think it is now vital that the police are allowed to get on with their important work.'", "cb482a73eaaf15931e739d9ed024b69493cdf228cb7a1c0d888ebe83": "Voters in Lebanon have gone to the polls in the first national election since a disastrous economic collapse and an explosion that wrecked the Beirut waterfront in 2020, amid low expectations that the leaders they hold responsible will face a serious challenge to their stranglehold on the country. A number of civil society candidates lined up against an entrenched ruling elite with pledges to change a political landscape in which feudal lords and their networks have enriched themselves since the end of the civil war. The chances of a real breakthrough appeared slim as the polls closed on Sunday evening, with the most likely outcome being a return to some form of the status quo, where power is apportioned along established sectarian lines, with existing control structures barely diluted. In the run-up to the election, the former prime minister and leader of Lebanon's Sunni Muslim community, Saad Hariri, had urged a voter boycott, and many of his followers appeared to pay heed, with low turnout in Sunni parts of the country amid a modest turnout nationwide. Many polling stations were without electricity and some were short on ballot papers, in a microcosm of the country's continuing disintegration under fuel and power shortages, and hyperinflation as the local currency continues to lose value. At some polling centres, there was no shortage of the precious commodity of fresh dollars, which had been used to lure the support of last-minute voters, particularly families who had arrived with multiple members. 'They have to give me something,' said one woman at a west Beirut polling station. 'What else am I going to get from these people?' At another polling station in the Keserwan region, one voter, Joseph Karam, 41, said he had considered voting for civil society candidates, but had decided to cast his ballot for the Lebanese Forces, a civil-war-era party that has been resurgent in recent years and has won the patronage of Gulf states for its willingness to confront Lebanon's dominant political bloc, Hezbollah. A total of 718 candidates from 15 electoral districts were running for seats in the 128-member parliament. Going into the poll, Hezbollah and its allies retained 71 seats. Their support base was expected to hold firm against a handful of secular Shia candidates and a push by mainstream parties backed by western states. The Lebanese Association for Democratic Elections said its delegates had been forced to withdraw from two polling stations after threats by Hezbollah supporters and their allies in the Shia Amal group. While fistfights were reported at some booths, and there were claims of harassment by rival blocs at other locations, the poll seemed to have defied predictions of more serious unrest. 'The issue now is counting these ballots,' said Anwar Habib, a voter from the southern city of Sidon. 'This is not a secure process. Hezbollah and Amal will do anything they can to win.' Preliminary results were expected by Monday. Weeks of political horse-trading are then expected before a government is formed.", "f3f8c33716ba6867f9ec8a59d8630a03a6903977d2b071283d439ae7": "Police leaders have accused Priti Patel of a 'power grab' that would allow the home secretary to intervene in local law enforcement matters and silence chiefs who want to speak out on issues deemed politically sensitive. An extraordinary row has broken out behind the scenes, with police bosses accusing Patel of trying to obtain new powers without parliamentary approval. The vehement backlash from chief constables and police and crime commissioners (PCCs) comes after an attempt by the government to redraft a written protocol that tries to define where the responsibility lies in policing. Parts of the plan have been labelled 'profoundly dangerous' anda 'power grab threatening operational independence' by one chief constable. Police and crime commissioners, in a private response, described some of the government proposals as 'ultra vires', meaning going beyond the home secretary's legal authority. The government handed powers over local policing to PCCs as part of its localism agenda a decade ago. But one government proposal makes it easier for the home secretary to intervene in such matters, while another increases the pressure on chiefs and PCCs to answer to the home secretary. A Home Office source with close knowledge of Patel's thinking rejected the criticism. They said: 'It is not a power grab, it is not a threat to operational independence, but making clear whose job and whose responsibility things are in the policing world. Should it not be the home secretary's role to ask questions?' The row at the top of the criminal justice system in England and Wales centres on the Home Office's attempt to revise the policing protocol, which was first produced in 2011 and came into force in January 2012. The Home Office draft of its new version, seen by the Guardian, was sent to chief constables and PCCs for their views, with consultation closing on 2 May. It sets out how the government, chief constables and police and crime commissioners should work together. It is widely agreed that, after a decade, updating the original version is a good idea. But the new draft protocol gives the home secretary the right to demand answers from chief constables, which PCCs believe impinges on their role. One chief constable said the protocol 'expanded' the home secretary's role beyond what is written in law. Another said: 'It was your party that gave these powers away, if they don't like it, take it back with legislation through parliament. A lot of chiefs believe the way it is written now is ultra vires. They are angry.' Since Patel became home secretary, her department has wanted more involvement in policing under a policy called 'lean in'. The chief constable said: 'They use the term leaning in. For the first time, the chiefs are leaning out.' A Home Office source said the changes made sense and expressed bafflement at the opposition. 'We are going to write down more clearly whose job is what, who can ask for information and who can do various things,' they said. The 2012 version of the protocol made clear that the introduction of PCCs had 'allowed for the Home Office to withdraw from day-to-day policing matters'. The new version, police leaders say, tries to claw back power without parliamentary approval, with Patel and her officials wanting to expand her 'legitimate role in holding PCCs and CCs [chief constables] to account', and thus make it easier to take police leaders to task. The proposed protocol says: 'We propose to lower the threshold for home secretary intervention in appropriate circumstances. This would equip the home secretary to intervene earlier as required, thus reducing the risk of failing to deliver effective policing.' Government proposals would also increase pressure on police leaders to provide the home secretary with information that she asks for, which they are not obliged to do. The document says: 'In order to ensure that the home secretary is equipped with the information required to respond to the public and parliament, PCCs and CCs should expect the home secretary to ask chief constables for information about policing matters.' In their private response, the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners said: 'There is no formal statutory power for the home secretary to require the police and crime commissioner to give information ... As such, any attempt to create a legal responsibility for police and crime commissioners to provide information to the home secretary through the protocol would be ultra vires.' Also in the proposed protocol is a demand that chief constables act 'in a politically neutral manner', which has been added to the previous stricture that they must be impartial. This is opposed by chief constables. One chief said they would be 'fettered' and unable to comment on public policy that they believe may affect crime fighting - such as the effects of austerity. Another chief said it was so imprecise that they could not publicly speak out on issues of political dispute - such as tougher sentences or opposing the decriminalisation of cannabis, which is supported by some frontline politicians. The elected police and crime commissioners said such a 'recentralisation' cannot be done through 'amendments to the protocol'. Instead, they said: 'Creation of new powers of strategic oversight can only be achieved through primary legislation and must be subject to the full scrutiny that is required of primary legislation.' In another section, they say, the 'proposed change seeks to alter the constitutional relationship between the police, the people, and central government, which is one of the great strengths of British policing'.  The deep misgivings come despite the protocol's foreword giving this reassurance: 'The protocol cannot create new law, provide actors with powers they do not already have, or take away the discretion of any relevant body to use their existing powers.' It adds: 'By updating the protocol, we intend to bring greater clarity to the role of the home secretary in the policing landscape, as well as the role of chief constables, PCCs and police and crime panels.'

The outburst against Monica McWilliams in 1997 was part of a boorish, sneering culture that deterred women from entering politics and sought to intimidate the few who dared. Change has come. Of the 90 newly elected assembly members who trooped into Stormont to sign the roll on Friday, 32 are women - a record 35%. Four of the top 10 candidates who polled highest in last week's election were women. The leaders of the biggest and third-biggest party, Michelle O'Neill of Sinn Fein and Naomi Long of Alliance, are women. Female MLAs have beamed from the assembly steps, veterans and newbies, embodying what could be a new era for equality in Northern Ireland - assuming the political impasse that is blocking the formation of the assembly is resolved. 'We are very happy with this increase! But there is still much more work to be done,' tweeted 50:50 NI, an advocacy group for women in Northern Ireland politics. Some wonder if this election represented progress, as a vicious brand of sexism and misogyny threaded the campaign, leaving some candidates shaken and fuelling demands for greater oversight of social media platforms. 'It was an absolute nightmare, it was purposeful, cruel and malicious,' said Cara Hunter, who won a seat for the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) in East Derry despite being targeted for sexual harassment. Anonymous trolls circulated a 40-second clip from a pornographic film, which they falsely claimed featured the 26-year-old. It was shared via WhatsApp and forwarded thousands of times. 'I can't articulate how it's impacted my whole family and circle of friends,' said Hunter. 'This was an intimidation tactic to make me feel embarrassed and humiliated for something I didn't do. Anyone can just create a lie to just blitz your reputation.' Trolls launched a similar smear campaign against Diane Forsyth, 38, who won a seat for the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) in South Down despite weeks of false claims and innuendo, including a screenshot with explicit images placed alongside her election poster. While canvassing, people told her she was a disgrace and asked if she had been involved in pornography. Other candidates suffered more direct abuse. Three men in east Belfast surrounded Hannah Kenny, of the People Before Profit party. 'They blocked her path, gripping her by the arm and throat before detailing the violence they would subject her to if she returned to the area,' the party said in a statement. In south Belfast, two youths attacked and tried to grab the phone of the SDLP's Elsie Trainor after she tried to stop them taking down her posters. 'There's a toxicity in this election and we need a real public conversation about protecting democracy and the ability to participate in elections without intimidation or threat,' tweeted Claire Hanna, an SDLP MP. Amnesty International cited research showing female politicians were 27 times likelier than male counterparts to face online abuse. A Belfast Telegraph survey in 2020 found that more than a quarter of female MLAs had been sexually harassed in their political careers and 70% had received sexist comments. It cannot be left just to police to tackle online abuse, said Connie Egan, an Alliance assembly member. 'These social media platforms need to take responsibility for abuse and harassment. But they're very slow to do so.' She also called for young people to receive better education about the impact of trolling. 'It needs to be a whole society approach,' she added. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, a Fine Gael member of the Irish parliament, told a court in Dublin this week that she felt a 'cold sense of dread' after being sent sexually explicit videos during a 2020 election campaign.

The 34-year-old needs support with basic tasks from his mother and his sister, and is a suspected victim of exploitation. The case has parallels with that of Osime Brown, the young autistic man who faced deportation to Jamaica but won the right to remain in the UK after legal intervention. He is among dozens facing deportation to Jamaica on a Home Office flight on Wednesday 18 May. But lawyers lodged emergency legal action on his behalf on Friday evening, hoping to scupper his removal. The man currently facing deportation has one custodial sentence: he was convicted of possessing a loaded handgun with intent to endanger life in August 2014 and handed a seven-year sentence. However, he gave evidence saying he was 'forced to own' the gun after being told to get into a car with three other men. The sentencing judge accepted that he was not a ringleader in the crime and said he may have been 'exploited by one other or others'. He has not committed any subsequent crimes. Numerous psychological and other assessments have identified that he has significant learning disabilities, struggles with reading and writing and is unable to live independently. He also has a congenital heart defect. A prison psychiatrist found that he was 'easily led and vulnerable to exploitation'. The judge who ruled in his favour found he would 'struggle to survive' in Jamaica due to his learning disabilities. 'I am not satisfied he would be capable of living independently. His size and learning disabilities render him liable to bullying and abuse. He is a vulnerable person,' the judge added. His distraught mother is trying to get his deportation halted. She says her son calls her many times each day from the detention centre in a state of panic and confusion. 'People would be shocked to know that human beings are being treated the way my son is being treated,' she said. 'People with mental health problems need to be free; being in a detention centre will be very bad for him. He has always lived with me and is unable to live by himself. I feel like a fish out of water without him. Now he's been detained, I don't even want to go into the kitchen to do any cooking because I always cooked everything for him.' She added that she believed he did not fully understand his predicament, and was struggling to eat regularly without her support. He was stressed and bewildered by his stay, she said, which was reminiscent of his prison sentence - throughout which he struggled enormously. Deportation flights to Jamaica are particularly controversial because some of those due to fly are Windrush descendants. Many have been here since childhood and no longer have links with the country of their birth. Numbers on the last four Jamaica deportation flights have decreased steadily - from 17 to 13 to seven and then four. The man is currently being held in an immigration removal centre and has said that if he was sent to Jamaica he would not be able to leave the airport because he would have nowhere to go. In the year ending September 2021, the number of forced removals were at a record low of 2,380, a 35% yearly drop. In 2004, the Home Office deported 21,425 people. But there are indications that the Home Office is trying to boost the number now that pandemic travel restrictions have been lifted, with offshoring to Rwanda and the first deportation charter flight to Iraq for many years taking place at the end of the month. Karen Doyle, of Movement For Justice, which is campaigning against the deportations to Jamaica, said: 'A judge rightly concluded that this man could not survive in Jamaica. Anyone spending 15 minutes with him could see that.' She added: 'That the Home Office would relentlessly pursue this vulnerable man is testament to their cruelty. When Priti Patel talks about deporting 'dangerous criminals', we know there are people like Osime Brown, like this man and countless others just like them who go through this torture.' A Home Office spokesperson said: 'Under the UK Borders Act 2007, the government is obligated to seek to remove non-British citizens convicted of an offence in the United Kingdom and sentenced to 12 months or more imprisonment. Each case is considered on its individual merits and we will consider any evidence which suggests removal is not appropriate carefully before removal action is taken.'

But when Jamal's mother arrived at the hospital crying just before the couple's daughter was born, he knew something was wrong. 'I asked her what happened and she told me that Shireen Abu Aqleh had been shot dead by the Israelis. Shireen had visited us in our town, Bureen, and covered demonstrations here many times. Everybody knows her,' the 29-year-old construction worker said. 'My mum was heartbroken. I said to myself, when the baby comes, we will call her Shireen, and my wife agreed.' Shireen Abu Aqleh Jamal Imran came into the world at about noon on Wednesday. At dawn that morning, her namesake, a 51-year-old veteran Al Jazeera journalist, had been shot in the head and killed during an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) raid in the West Bank town of Jenin. Israeli officials said they believed the dual Palestinian-American citizen had died after being hit by Palestinian fire during an altercation between IDF soldiers and Palestinian gunmen. But the reporter's colleagues at the scene said there were no militants near the small group of journalists - all wearing helmets and body armour clearly marked as 'press' - when they came under fire from the direction of the Israeli unit. Ali Samodi, an Al Jazeera producer who was shot in the back, told the Observer from his hospital bed that even after Abu Aqleh had fallen to the ground and colleagues tried to reach her, the bullets kept coming. Video of the incident confirms this version of events. Israel has firmly rejected allegations that its soldiers deliberately targeted the journalists, but the international community is demanding answers in what Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based TV network, has described as an 'assassination' carried out 'in cold blood'. Unlike the killings of anonymous Palestinians that occur in the occupied West Bank on a regular basis, Abu Aqleh was a familiar face, broadcasting to millions across the Arab world and well known for her bravery during a 15-year television news career. She was also a US citizen. This time, an Israeli strategy of deflection and denial has backfired. What is seen by the Palestinians as Israeli obfuscation also threatens to inflame a spate of violence that has surged across Israel and the Palestinian territories since late March. A video released by the IDF of what it said were Palestinian militants engaged in a firefight in Jenin on the morning Abu Aqleh was killed has been heavily criticised: human rights group B'Tselem, which visited the two locations, found it was impossible for the shooting in the IDF-distributed video to be the same gunfire that hit Abu Aqleh and Samodi. And the spectacle of Israeli police storming Abu Aqleh's funeral procession in Jerusalem on Friday, causing pallbearers to drop her coffin, has added to Palestinian and international outrage. The public display of Palestinian flags in occupied East Jerusalem is forbidden by the Israeli authorities under any circumstances, but many mourners arrived waving Palestinian banners. The journalist's casket was also draped in the flag, followed by an orange stretcher bearing a flak jacket marked 'press'. The EU said it was appalled by the 'unnecessary' force used by the Israeli police, while the White House described footage of the scene as 'deeply disturbing'.  Israel's police said the mourners were 'disrupting public order' by throwing stones at the heavy police presence, but on Saturday said an investigation into the officers' actions would be launched. 'I was horrified by what I saw on TV from the funeral. I think it shows how Shireen exposed [Israel], she succeeded in that not just in life but in death also,' Imran said. Not letting her funeral proceed with respect ... they have publicly exposed themselves for the world to see.' The battle of narratives sparked by Abu Aqleh's death is far from over. Palestinian officials have rejected the Israeli offer of a joint investigation, saying 'criminals cannot be trusted', leading Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett to accuse the Palestinians of denying Israel 'access to the basic findings required to get to the truth'. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said during a state memorial for Abu Aqleh in the Palestinian town of Ramallah on Thursday that the case will be referred to the international criminal court, of which Israel is not a member and whose jurisdiction the state disputes. An interim Israeli army investigation 'could not determine' who fired the fatal bullet, an IDF statement said on Friday, while an initial probe by the Palestinian public prosecution found that 'the only origin of the shooting was the Israeli occupation forces'. In the meantime, even more so than during her career, Abu Aqleh's fame has grown. Outside the reporter's home in Beit Hanina in East Jerusalem this week, neighbours and friends gathered daily to mourn her death despite a raid on the house on Wednesday by Israeli forces: many have put up pictures of her in their windows. On the quiet street outside, local children gather waving Palestinian flags. 'Shireen was a Christian and we are a Muslim family, but that didn't matter,' one neighbour said. 'She has united us.' For the thousands of people who have thronged streets across the West Bank and Jerusalem this week in tribute, Abu Aqleh's life and death has become a potent symbol. 'Shireen's story is the story of the Palestinian people,' said Imran, the father of newborn Shireen. 'She will never be forgotten, especially for our family. Every time we call her name we will remember.'", "4acb0693548e6cf3f89bf9efa1d84a7a3b47b7da129f70ef627ba7be": "Patients having major abdominal operations should be offered the option of robotic surgery, doctors and scientists have said, after a world-first clinical trial found the procedures dramatically speed up recovery times, reduce complications and cut the risk of blood clots. In a first-of-its-kind three-year study, experts at University College London (UCL) and the University of Sheffield discovered that patients having robot-assisted bladder cancer surgery recovered faster and returned home sooner than patients who had open surgery. The findings were presented at the American Urological Association annual meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana. Robotic surgery reduced the chance of readmission by half (52%), and led to a 77% reduction in the prevalence of blood clots, when compared with patients who had open surgery. Researchers said the findings challenged the notion that open surgery was the 'gold standard' for major operations. 'This is an important finding,' said co-chief investigator Prof James Catto, a professor of urological surgery at the University of Sheffield. 'Time in hospital is reduced and recovery is faster when using this advanced surgery. We see fewer complications from the improved mobility and less time spent in bed.' The trial ran from March 2017 to March 2020 and involved 29 surgeons at nine UK hospital trusts. A total of 338 patients with non-metastatic bladder cancer were split into two groups, with 169 patients having robot-assisted bladder removal and reconstruction, and 169 patients having open surgery. 'Previous trials of robotic surgery have focused on longer-term outcomes,' said Catto. 'They have shown similar cancer cure rates and similar levels of long-term recovery after surgery. None have looked at differences in the immediate days and weeks after surgery.' Researchers found that, on average, the robot-assisted group stayed eight days in hospital, compared with 10 days for the open surgery group. Re-admittance to hospital within 90 days of surgery was also reduced, they said, at 21% for the robot-assisted group and 32% for those who had open surgery. Open surgery involves a surgeon working directly on a patient and involves large incisions in the skin and muscle, but in robot-assisted surgery, surgeons guide minimally invasive instruments remotely. Scientists behind the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, said it provides the strongest evidence so far of the patient benefit of robot-assisted surgery. They are calling on the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (Nice) to make robotic surgery available as a clinical option across the UK for all major abdominal surgeries including colorectal, gastro-intestinal and gynaecological procedures. Prof John Kelly, a professor of uro-oncology at UCL and consultant surgeon at University College London hospitals, who was co-chief investigator, said: 'In this study we wanted to establish if robot-assisted surgery, when compared to open surgery, reduced time spent in hospital, reduced readmissions, and led to better levels of fitness and quality of life; on all counts this was shown.' The 'striking' reduction in blood clots was an unexpected finding, he added, which 'indicates a safe surgery with patients benefiting from far fewer complications, early mobilisation and a quicker return to normal life'. 'In light of the positive findings, the perception of open surgery as the gold standard for major surgeries is now being challenged for the first time. We hope that all eligible patients needing major abdominal operations can now be offered the option of having robotic surgery.'", "8a96796eb80b43c5c742d0cb70a7e7454f01f81bd6fe16b261e1b915": "", "4b4be2193503a3658570b0682b67f387e987adb8815e7affc3b64ce2": "", "fe5149a524583e0ac7f7db0d2e4937df5c0c91c6a3f15bb030d058c2": "", "e3a7b152fb5cd8759a25562fcab3945361c342bf95aa4ae26fa99591": "", "2eea3e593a316dbb383cd797235de35bfe9771fa19ad9f637d7399bc": "", "5469d1f9d2c9e608ab6ea97051e1de2b90aa8a1675ca13e85fb80570": "", "ad714d2c8b7d5e49550930ae4128faecd2c26c03f1652ffde9993b3a": "", "f52786331a1864a0e5c3963be1f9461ae0862c6cfe145c27aa12ffdc": "In among the relief and euphoria that attended the return to Britain of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and businessman Anoosheh Ashoori from Iranian jails in March, one family was feeling precisely the opposite emotions. The Foreign Office deal that finally brought Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori home was always supposed to involve three British prisoners. Morad Tahbaz, 66, has been incarcerated in Tehran for four years. Right up until a week before the deal was made, the Tahbaz family had been told categorically by Liz Truss's department that Morad - along with his wife, Vida, 64, currently subject to a travel ban in Iran - would be part of any agreement. No one would be left behind. They discovered the truth only when they saw the television news. Roxanne Tahbaz, the couple's eldest daughter, lives in south-west London. When I spoke to her at her home last week, she was still reliving the despair of seeing those TV pictures. For the previous four years, the Tahbaz family had followed British government advice and not spoken to the media, so as 'not to jeopardise any negotiations'. They were in a more complicated situation than Richard Ratcliffe, campaigning in the UK for his wife, since Vida Tahbaz was trapped in Tehran. Roxanne has a brother and a sister. 'Our biggest concern was that because we were the only non-public family, we'd be forgotten,' she says. 'They were like, 'no, no. They're definitely in the deal'.'  Tahbaz's situation is complicated by the fact that he is tri-national; he has US and Iranian passports as well as his British one. Twice previously, the British government had mooted to the family that a deal might be possible in which Tahbaz could be freed from prison but, unlike the others, held in Iran. 'We vehemently disagreed with that approach,' Roxanne says. 'We were quite certain that if they did that, as soon as the others were back home, they'd put him back in prison. And that's exactly what happened.' Tahbaz was released from the notorious Evin jail when the deal happened. He was returned there 48 hours later. Four foreign secretaries have overseen the case: Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab and Truss. The family felt that Hunt displayed proper empathy. They haven't heard directly from Truss since December, when, Roxanne says, 'she gave a personal reassurance that my father wouldn't be left behind'. Tahbaz had been working in animal conservation projects in Iran, on and off, for a decade when he was arrested in 2018. 'My mum had just gone over to keep him company,' Roxanne recalls. 'He's an entrepreneur. He started in commercial property development. And then, when he was partly retired, he founded the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation. It was a passion project, working to monitor endangered species.' Iranian authorities arrested Tahbaz along with eight other heritage foundation colleagues. The group were accused of espionage after tracking species with cameras. A UK government committee found no evidence to support that claim. In November 2019, Tahbaz was sentenced to 10 years in prison for 'contacts with the US enemy government'. 'The Foreign Office have told us the Iranians decided that my father is American,' Roxanne says. 'From where we're sitting, it's not up to Iran to say. He was born in London, in Hammersmith hospital, a mile up the road from here. He went to school in the UK from the age of four and only then went to university in the States. My mum [also tri-national] has had a British passport since they got married [nearly 40 years ago].' Roxanne can't allow herself to think that the British government abandoned her father in order to win some quick, positive headlines. But still, the triumphant tone of the Foreign Office messaging was hard to take. 'They were making public statements congratulating themselves about their skilful negotiations,' she says. 'And we were thinking: excuse me?' She was unable to talk properly to her father in the 48 hours he was out of prison. 'He had guards with him all the time. Every hour that passed, we thought he'd be taken away. Later that week, they took him out of the prison again, this time just for 24 hours. It was then that he decided to start a hunger strike, because he couldn't take it any more.' After nine days, the family persuaded Tahbaz to start eating. He was already in vulnerable health having survived two different cancers in the last decade, which have left him requiring regular monitoring and treatment. That is only one of the reasons why Roxanne finds it hard to think about him in prison. Does she know the circumstances in which he's being held? 'He tries not to talk about it,' she says. 'I think he's so conscious of the fact that he's still our dad. He gets a chance to call for about two minutes, very infrequently. And then he's always like, 'I love you. I miss you. Tell me what's happening in your life? What's going on at work? Can I give you any advice?' 'He's always been that kind of dad. My mum was always the light of the room. And my father was always very collected, calm.' And she never knows when he will call? 'Sometimes my mum can connect us [on speaker] and sometimes she can't. I drive everyone crazy with 'phantom phone syndrome'. If I wake up in the night, and my phone's lit up, I'm thinking, 'Oh my God, did I miss him?' I take my phone everywhere, to the gym, to the bathroom.' Unless you've lived that life, Roxanne says, you can't imagine what every day is like: 'Richard [Ratcliffe] said it best: we're all a part of a club that nobody wants to be a member of. My mum became quite close with Nazanin, because when Nazanin was out of prison on furlough, they spent time together. She was so wonderful to my mum. And Richard, on this side, was always a guiding light for us. When they did their press conference after Nazanin got home, they rang me the night before and said, 'we'd like to invite you to come and make a statement because it isn't right, what has happened'.' Roxanne talked to her brother and sister, and her aunts and uncles. 'We took a family vote - everything's done by committee - and basically decided, if we don't go public now, my father will never come out.' She stayed up all that night drafting a statement, and was 'a basket of nerves, because I never was a public speaker'. In the fortnight after that, she did nearly 50 news interviews. She lives in fear of saying the wrong thing. 'The worst thing is that the moment you wake up, you're always a bit broken. Even if it's a birthday, you feel guilty to feel any happiness.' Roxanne has continued to work as a business consultant while keeping up her campaigning. 'There's days where I'm just helpless,' she says. 'My boyfriend is brilliant. He'll be: 'What do you want to eat? Do you want to have a bath? You want a drink?' I sit there and I'm like: 'I don't know'.' Then, a lot of the rest of the time, she says: 'You feel it's like that adrenaline rush when a kid is under a car and the mum finds the strength to lift it. And you think: how long do I have to be this strong?' Amnesty International has declared Tahbaz a 'prisoner of conscience'. After we speak, Roxanne has a meeting to discuss progress on their campaign calling on the government to tell the family their plans to secure his release. Unlike Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who campaigned so vocally for Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Roxanne's MP, the Conservative Felicity Buchan, counsels silence, in line with the Foreign Office. 'From the beginning, there was a weekly catch-up call with the family or an email. But ever since the other two were released, the only update we've had is: 'we're working on everything at the highest levels',' Roxanne says. 'That's not enough any more.' The Observer contacted Buchan's office for comment, but did not receive a reply. The family has continued to receive support from Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who raised Tahbaz's fate when she met the prime minister at Downing Street. In paying the historic debt to Iran of PS400m, to ease the release of the two other prisoners, she fears that the British government has played its hand. 'What's left for my father now? What's the next move? Because this felt like a checkmate moment. 'And two months later we're still sitting on the side, waiting.'", "d7151efbc6fe0dbb41a2a15f0f57167cbbd84ec9d2b3250b204bcad1": "", "2d591b9afbc3c96d8f001a46666a5643d9757245363ee840c073abef": "In one of Russia's most high-profile marketing campaigns, film star Bruce Willis appeared in cinematic advertisements with a car chase and a rooftop rescue, ending with the slogan, 'Trust is just like me, but a bank.' The campaign for National Bank Trust in 2011 - which included cardboard cutouts of Willis popping up in 400 branches across Russia - was credited with raising the bank's profile and boosting business. Ministers are now under pressure to impose sanctions on the bank over its efforts to recover hundreds of millions of pounds in debts from the UK. A decade ago, money was pouring in to the bank's coffers from clients and large chunks were sent around the world in loans for a network of offshore companies. But it was subsequently alleged that the elaborate corporate structure incorporated fake documents and was a fraudulent scheme that concealed bad debts and enriched key executives. Willis, whose family announced earlier this year he had the neurological disorder aphasia, had no knowledge of the alleged scheme. The high court in London ruled in January 2020 that the bank was owed $900m (PS735m) compensation from three former bosses, two settled in Britain, allegedly involved in the scheme. The bank is now seeking to recover money owed in the UK, but ministers face questions on whether sanctions will stop it getting the cash. National Bank Trust is now majority owned by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, so any money recovered in Britain could flow back to the Russian state. Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said: 'There are too many question marks around the National Bank Trust and whether it is, in fact, able to channel funds to the Putin regime. 'We need crystal-clear answers about whether it is able to raise foreign cash, that the Kremlin is so desperate for, and send it back to Russia. 'The government must reassure the British public that sanctions are being applied to all Kremlin cronies without exception, and that National Bank Trust is in no position to help Putin fund his war chest. If it is, it must be sanctioned straight away.' Jardine has tabled parliamentary questions about whether the bank will be targeted with sanctions. The Foreign Office announced economic sanctions targeting the Russian central bank on 28 February, four days after the invasion of Ukraine. The Foreign Office would not comment on whether National Bank Trust also faces sanctions. The bank alleges its former majority owners - Ilya Yurov, former chair of the supervisory board, Nikolay Fetisov, its former president, and Sergey Belyaev - orchestrated a fraud to conceal bad debts and extract millions of dollars in salaries and bonuses. Russia tried to extradite Yurov from the UK in 2018, but the request was refused on the grounds he would not receive a fair trial. Steptoe & Johnson, the legal firm that acted for the bank, said an English 'fixer' called Benedict Worsley ran the bank's offshore network, allegedly hiring a team in Cyprus which was 'churning out fake documents in what only can be described as a document factory'. Yurov and Fetisov said the offshore companies were properly used for 'balance sheet management', while Belyaev, who settled in the US, denied knowledge of the scheme. Worsley, who was not called to give evidence at the hearing but was described as a man who 'likes to act like James Bond', has said all decisions involving corporate administration were made by the bank's owners or managers. The bank collapsed in December 2014 and required a state-backed bailout of more than 100bn rubles (PS1.2bn). The high court heard in 2018 that Yurov's family properties, held in the name of his wife, Nataliya, included Oxney Court, a gothic manor house with a swimming pool and tennis court on the Kent coast bought for PS4.1m in 2012; two properties in Cyprus; and three flats in Chelsea with a combined value of over PS6m. The Fetisov family portfolio included a PS4.25m mansion in Oxshott, Surrey; a PS1.6m flat in Chelsea; and a residence near Moscow. Mazars, the international accounting and advisory firm, announced in May 2020 that it was working as joint trustees in the bankruptcy of Yurov and Fetisov. It recently filed court applications to obtain bank statements linked to the case. The firm was appointed by the business secretary on behalf of the high court and is seeking to recover the bankrupts' assets for the benefit of creditors, including National Bank Trust. Mazars said it complied with all sanctions and no transactions would occur with sanctioned entities or their subsidiaries without court permission. National Bank Trust did not respond to a request for comment. UK officials say they are systematically sanctioning Russian individuals and organisations, but will not comment on specific cases. One official said: ''While he [Putin] continues this war, we will continue tightening the ratchet with further sanctions.'", "81408617b4caeb974946da15adc2751b84f7796cb09693bb708ddd5c": "This story was published in partnership with The Guardian and The Trace, a non-profit newsroom covering gun violence in America. Sign up for its newsletter here. There's no such thing as an average day for Nasser 'Nash' Baker, but they do tend to start the same way. Most people may know about Baker's line of work from Nightcrawler, the 2014 film in which Jake Gyllenhaal skulks around Los Angeles to film car crashes and murder scenes. But Baker refers to himself as a 'daycrawler', leaving his home in south Los Angeles every day around noon wearing his bulletproof vest and helmet.  Baker usually parks his blue Crown Victoria at a Starbucks in a plaza at the intersection of Western and Slauson avenues, not far from his home, and starts listening to his police scanner and browsing news wires. Inevitably, at some point, he hears three beeps over the scanner and 'goes into another zone' as he drives toward the site of a shooting. For more than 20 years, Baker, 49, has covered the aftermath of shootings and police violence in south LA's historically-Black neighborhoods and cities like Inglewood, Watts and Compton. He works as a stringer for Onscene.tv, a southern California news gathering service from which local outlets buy footage.  He also runs A Million Hits, an Instagram account and YouTube channel that have become the go-to source of information on shootings for many Angelenos living in the communities that face the most gun violence. Over the course of Baker's two-decade long career, his car has been shot up, he has administered first aid to gunshot wound victims and has had police threaten to break his equipment. Unlike Gyllenhaal's character, he doesn't salivate when he hears news of a shooting. But he continues to hit the streets daily to report reliable information in communities many other reporters either forget about or overlook, he says, hoping to help keep neighborhoods safe, dispel the rumors that follow homicides and can lead to retaliation, and force police accountability. 'Most outlets aren't writing about what happened on 81st and Figueroa, so the people are using me to verify and fact check so they can do their homework because they know if I say something, it's backed by an official,' he said. 'A Million Hits is here to be the first outlet to record, edit and report our stories. We're here to film the officer with their knees on people's necks.' 'South LA check-in, South LA check-in.' They are usually Baker's first words on Instagram as he pulls up to the scene of a shooting. His appearance belies his profession, wearing black-rimmed glasses, dressed in camouflage, and arms toned by more than a decade of holding a professional camera, sometimes for hours as a crime scene unfolds. His helmet and can carry cell phones and holders, a flashlight, a digital police scanner, two GoPro cameras and a backup video camera. He tells his followers what he knows - location, number of people shot, whether anyone's been taken to the emergency room - and implores those living nearby to check on their loved ones and take their kids inside. His videos come with a healthy dose of commentary, soliciting prayers and answers for a victim's family, critiquing local police or speaking on the larger scourge of gun violence's impact on Black Americans. Baker's profile has grown significantly in recent years, amassing nearly 15,000 YouTube subscribers and over 22,000 Instagram followers, an enviable count for an independent journalist. He was featured in the 2017 Netflix documentary series Shot in the Dark, which focused on the world of videographers who film and sell footage of the aftermaths of car accidents, fires and homicides. Baker's work intersects with that of others. There are several social media pages solely dedicated to putting out information about gun violence affecting Black people living in American cities, like the Instagram accounts @nogunzone and @unsolvemurdersinphilly in Philadelphia. There are stringers all over the country racing to capture footage of local crime scenes. They have different approaches, goals, motivations, and reliability. But Baker has shaped A Million Hits into its own thing: a reliable source of information on neighborhoods that rarely get the in-depth treatment, with Baker shooting, editing and verifying the footage. It's made A Million Hits a staple of the news diet of many people living in places like south Los Angeles, Compton and Watts. Many of his followers are families and friends of people who were killed. He now regularly gets calls from people in jail or prison, who ask him what he knows about a recent shooting. He's happy to take the calls, he says, since they allow him to dispel rumors that have made their way around the streets or prisons and can lead to retaliation. 'You have to be a counterweight and can't let things get too out of control,' Baker said. In addition to making sure verified information is available to the communities where the most shootings occur, Baker has come to see himself as an ardent defender of the first amendment. So much so that he's gone head to head with police officers to ensure that he can film the aftermath of shooting scenes. He's filed a complaint against the Los Angeles police department and sued the LA county sheriff's department over incidents in 2020. Baker alleges that Los Angeles police officers targeted him and photojournalist Nicholas Stern with batons and rubber bullets and unjustly arrested them while covering a protest following the police killing of George Floyd. He also says that later that year, sheriff's deputies assaulted him while he was filming an interaction between protesters and deputies outside of a hospital where two deputies were being treated for gunshot wounds. One deputy threatened to break his camera, he says. Both the Los Angeles police department and sheriff's department declined to comment on Baker's allegations, citing pending litigation. Baker has also worked with the Los Angeles press club to push for the enactment of SB 98, state legislation that makes members of the press exempt from police dispersal orders while they cover demonstrations. 'We have to protect our first amendment rights,' Baker said. 'I continue to film police and file complaints and lawsuits to make sure our rights will be protected. And that's something I'm going to pass down through generations. It's our civil right.' Baker was born in Chicago and grew up in South Central LA in a Muslim family. Growing up, he learned martial arts and prepared the bodies of other Muslims for burial in a process called Ghusl. He undertook the pilgrimage to Mecca, called Hajj, when he was 18.  He credits these experiences as the driving force behind his impulse to protect his community and empower people to rely on each other. 'We grew up with those values and were trained to help the community,' Baker said. 'I was trained to survive in the streets before I started filming them. I had to know the areas and work with the people in them.'  He watched high school classmates, and even his brother, become engulfed in gang life and says most of the people he met in high school have been killed or incarcerated for decades. 'They were gonna be football or basketball players. Some even went to community college. No one started off just being involved in gun violence,' Baker said. Equally formative were the 1992 LA riots. Baker was about to graduate high school when four Los Angeles police officers were acquitted in the savage beating of Rodney King, and LA neighborhoods rose up. Dozens of businesses were destroyed and 50 people were killed, 10 of them by police. It put into stark focus the pain his community was facing from police violence, over-incarceration, the crack-cocaine epidemic and the gun violence that accompanied all of these phenomena. Before his foray into news, Baker had a successful rap career under the name LA Nash. He got his start in the local press in the early 2000s, doing camera work with other independent journalists who would film police interactions throughout south LA. He got his first press pass when he started working for Ombudsman Press International, a local outlet for the oversight body that investigates claims of misconduct against officials, law enforcement and government contractors. Baker would take photos for the newspaper, conduct video interviews and film police stops and other interactions throughout the city. He knew nothing about stringing and selling footage to local news stations until he was thrust into what he refers to as the worst day of his life. On 19 February 2008, Baker was on a job for the Ombudsman Press in an unincorporated neighborhood of south Los Angeles, when he heard a high-pitched long beep on the scanner, followed by the announcement of an apparent shooting with multiple people injured on Denker Avenue. Back then, Baker's only equipment was an eight millimeter video camera and the analog police scanner that picked up a few Los Angeles police, county fire and sheriff's channels. Baker recognized the address the dispatcher on the other end of the device gave as Washington Preparatory high school, the school he graduated from in 1992. 'There was a football game going on and by the time I got to the school there was a lot of yelling and screaming,' Baker recalled. 'The paramedics were just getting there and it was like a war zone. I didn't know if there was an active shooter on the loose. I just wanted to come in and help.' He began filming as people were loaded into ambulances and showed the footage to terrified parents who were desperately seeking information about their kids. A reporter noticed what he was doing and suddenly multiple people were coming up to him asking who he was with and how much the ambulance transport footage was going for. From then on, he started filming footage of transports via ambulance or coroner van and detectives as they analyzed a crime scene and sold them on his own. He joined Onscene.tv later that year. At Onscene.tv, he continued to focus on the areas he knew best: South Central, Watts and Compton. Car accidents and fire footage was, and in many cases still is, the bread and butter of stringing for local news, he said. And over the years, news stations would buy shooting footage less and less frequently. Uninterested in covering weather or car crash scenes, he started A Million Hits, which he named after an excerpt from a speech given during the fifth anniversary of the Million Man March in 2000. 'I cover urban stuff in my area. I cover what my children would need to know,' Baker said. In March 2019, Baker covered his most high profile shooting yet. He was driving toward Leimert Park, when he heard on the scanner three people had been shot at the intersection of Slauson Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard, just a u-turn and a few minutes' drive from where Baker had been. Once he pulled up, he realized the shooting was at the Marathon Store, which was founded by rapper Nipsey Hussle. Baker parked at a nearby donut shop and watched as police taped off the scene, police cars arrived, and a crowd of locals began to gather. No one knew who had been shot until a woman yelled, 'Nip!' and the crowd went under the police tape to get answers for themselves. Baker went to the back of the store and saw Hussle's beard. 'That's when I realized it'll never be the same around here,' he recalled. Between the protests and the homicide scenes, Baker says he's seen things so traumatic that he has to leave them at the door before coming home to his two young sons and wife. 'My wife strings with me so we have to let out those cries and make sure the stories are edited and published that day. You can't keep it in. If we hold all these stories in it's like cancer. We spend most of our time helping so we don't carry the weight.' Baker met his wife, Mia Robinson, in the Starbucks on Western and Slauson, and they bonded over their shared passion for videography. Robinson went to film her first shooting scene in 2016 and says she, too, has been hooked on stringing ever since. 'It's real, it's almost like you feel alive for the first time and you realize that gun violence is real and it's breaking up families,' she said of her time as a videographer. 'You're tapping into a world that, if you look, is right under your feet, but people don't pay attention.' They both worry about each other's safety in the field but say they see how much the people who live where gun violence is concentrated value A Million Hits. To soothe her anxieties, Robinson surprised Baker with an upgraded bulletproof vest as a Christmas gift. The couple hopes A Million hits will eventually be able to compete with other local outlets and stand out as a site specifically for the communities where gun violence happens most. 'One of the benefits of A Million Hits is that I have my videos on both sides, the social media and the news, but we work to serve people who need to know what happened to their loved one,' Baker said. 'I don't need a major endorsement from anyone to do this because this is the area I grew up in.' 'I hope that he can turn his brand into a real network and be that outlet people go to instead of having to go to channel seven. He can be that credible voice,' Robinson echoed. Over the years, Baker has seen the communities he covers, and the gun violence within them, evolve. In his teens and early adulthood, nearly everyone he knew was affiliated with a gang, he said. As years passed, those people either died or were locked up in prison. 'Gang life is what it was out there. Whether it's prison or more violence. They both begin with a gun in LA. There was no other tool people would use to solve their issues,' he said of the 1990s. Since then, south LA has transformed from a place that was once primarily associated with violence and crime by people living outside of its neighborhoods and suffered from the disinvestment that comes with this perception to one that is rapidly gentrifying, he says. For more than a decade, gun violence in Los Angeles has decreased exponentially, as has the Black population in communities where they were once sequestered due to the racist housing policies of the mid-20th century. 'We were losing people in South Central LA, and this is the first time people are moving back and walking their dogs,' Baker said of how he's seen the area change. 'No one even cared about what was happening back then but some of us never left.' And even as he's seen rents and property increase and news businesses emerge he says that gun violence has been a stubborn constant for south LA natives. 'Black folks have to realize that we've done ... so much violence has happened among us, I think that going forward it'll be hard to curb,' he continued. For South Central natives like Tina Sampay, Baker has been a go-to outlet for years. She started following A Million Hits from the early days to keep up with what was happening in her hometown while she was away at college in northern California. 'He was the only one doing that type of work within South Central and other inner-cities,' she said. 'I would hear about shootings here and there but It was hard to find [more] information. But, Nash was the one who had his boots on the ground and was going to these places.' Since coming back to Los Angeles, Sampay has founded her own news media outlet under the name Slauson Girl, gaining nearly 40,000 Instagram followers with daily news posts about topics ranging from celebrities to local crime and politics. She first met Baker when she was driving through her neighborhood and came across a shooting scene where Baker was also filming, and hopes that Baker will become an outlet of record and play an integral role in the larger Black media ecosystem in LA county. 'For the level of work he has done, he should be compensated and have his own van and production space,' Sampay continued about Baker. 'If we as Black media are not able to compete at the same level as other journalists with more resources then we'll have to keep allowing people to exploit our communities for views.'", "4c10c4e560921e4bb5f46403448483f354d035d757e1e3814a6f74ee": "", "60608c469c01827b522366ccdacfdb3670593f23d2b6db4b3f1c349d": "", "81351f571ece42d1ae60c8f12bc0f9377b087b0f749a406020147108": "", "327206f746cae5692d44348316ed197435fb453c32632215fe64e96a": "Vigils were held across Buffalo, New York, for the victims of the Tops Friendly shooting Sunday, as Black residents on the city's East Side mourned and attempted to come to terms with the brief, brutal event that had been visited on the neighborhood hours earlier. The square where the shooting took placed, surrounded by vacant lots that residents said were the result of decades of segregation and systemic racism, is the community's center, with Tops Friendly functioning as the only grocery store for the immediate area. In striking Tops Friendly, the shooter - an 18-year-old self-confessed white supremacist - was not just hitting at a supermarket, but also a place where locals gathered as a community. 'No weapons formed against me shall prosper,' said Karen Davis-Butler, a nurse and mother of three, who had tears streaming down her face. 'It means that's formed against us God is going to make sure it doesn't hurt us. But we weren't covered yesterday and the guy wasn't covered. And I feel bad for him too.' Despite the horrors wrought on the neighborhood by the 18-year-old white shooter, Davis-Butler said others were to blame too for filling him with hate. 'He's only 18. Damn nearly grown. Where did he learn all of this stuff from? Who pushed this into his head? Where was his parents when he was looking at this stuff on the internet? This is like a gang thing with them, but it's white supremacy and racism, and it's taught. You're not born hating Black people.' Davis-Butler said she was in Family Dollar next to the supermarket when the shooting began. 'We saw everybody running, and they told us to stay in the store. It was crazy.' 'This is where Juneteenth started, where our community used to thrive. We have a food desert here, and that's racism, too. If you go on the other side of the city you see grocery store after grocery store. The racism here is all day everyday.' To Maurice Burse, another resident, the journey that the shooter allegedly made from his home in Conklin, near Binghamton 200 miles south, meant that he past other upstate New York cities, like Rochester and Syracuse. 'It was by design, he knew what he was doing and that's so sad. We've got sick people here, and some people would like nothing more than to have a race war and they'll do anything to try to cause it. People really need to wake up,' Burse said. The neighborhood, Burse said, had begun to come back from the blight of previous decades. 'But to get up in the morning and see all of this ...hmmm, it's bad,' he said waving to the encampments of police and media trucks that had suddenly sprouted in the strong May sun. 'Its bad enough what goes on in the area already.' Twins Shameka and Tasheka Walker were standing on the corner of Riley and Jefferson, surveying the scene. 'He was telling them on livestream what he was going to do. But they probably took it as joke,' said Tasheka. But a joke it was not - the shooter had reportedly posted missives about the great replacement theory, the ideological underpinning of many racist mass shootings, including in Norway and New Zealand. 'They're probably saying we're having too many Black children but the community here is made up of all different races. The community here is like family, and Tops is always helpful, so how he had the audacity to come here and do this,' said Shameka. 'What made you drive all this way and hit this. Why?' An analysis from the University of Michigan, based on data from the 2010 census, found that the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metro area is the sixth most Black-White segregated in the nation. A University of Buffalo report in 2021 found that living conditions for Black residents in Buffalo had improved little and in some cases had declined over the preceding 30 years. Local activist and chef Brandon Moses-Bonner, 26, said the problem is 'everybody who is not addressing racism white supremacy' - an issue he believed had shaped his generation. 'These young guys get radicalized by the internet, by Q-Anon, by white supremacists, who seek out them because they feel like victims. Nobody wants to address the problem because they're afraid of hurting their feelings because they think saying racism is bad is indoctrination. But it's not - it's basic human decency.' Speaking to Face the Nation on Sunday morning, Buffalo mayor Byron Brown said the community had been experiencing fresh development and vowed that the awful event would not stop that happening. 'People have been hoping and waiting for investment and growth and opportunity. We are beginning to see that in this community, in all parts of the city, and we won't let that progress stop. We won't let hateful ideology stop the progress that we are seeing and experiencing in the city of Buffalo.'", "d7c526dfe8741b9c4b8db2b276db34f417fb042ca6ca8310127ffd12": "North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, has warned his country has been thrown into 'great turmoil' after reporting another 21 deaths, days after the secretive state first admitted it was in the grip of a coronavirus outbreak. The nation's total death toll now stands at 27, with 524,440 illnesses attributed to a rapid spread of fever consistent with Covid since late April. The regime said 243,630 people had recovered and 280,810 remained in quarantine. However, it did not specify how many of the cases and deaths had been confirmed as Covid-19 infections. The wave of Covid-19 cases comes as other nations, such as South Africa, have reported fresh outbreaks of the disease while the US revealed last week that it had recorded more than 80m Covid cases since the pandemic began. More than one million people have died in the US from the disease, a figure described as 'a tragic milestone' by President Joe Biden. These global developments indicate that the Covid pandemic is showing no signs of retreating. North Korea imposed 'maximum preventive measures' in a nationwide lockdown on Friday after conceding that its attempts to contain the virus over the past two years had failed. 'The spread of the malignant epidemic is a great turmoil to fall on our country since the founding,' Kim told an emergency meeting of the ruling Workers' party. 'But if we don't lose focus in implementing epidemic policy and maintain strong organisation power ... we can more than overcome the crisis.' The outbreak presents a potentially serious risk to North Korea, which is not believed to have vaccinated its 26 million people. Its poorly resourced healthcare system would also struggle to cope with a major outbreak, say international health officials. Kee Park of Harvard Medical School said the regime is testing only 1,400 people a week. North Korea had previously insisted it had not recorded a single Covid case since it closed its borders at the start of the pandemic more than two years ago. That move cut off trade with China and inflicted more damage on an economy already battered by natural disaster and UN sanctions imposed in response to its nuclear and missile tests. After maintaining one of the world's strictest border closures to shield its poor healthcare system, North Korea eventually reopened railroad freight traffic with China in January. North Korea has shunned offers of Covid vaccines from China and Russia, and from the World Health Organization's Covax scheme - apparently because administering the jabs would require outside monitoring. In South Africa, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases reported last week that there had been 10,017 new Covid-19 cases a day. It was the first time since January that the institute had logged more than 10,000 new daily infections. Health authorities have warned the new surge of infections is driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-variants, which are now dominant in South Africa. The country only exited a fourth wave of Covid in January but the southern hemisphere winter months had long been seen as a potential problem. However, the rapid spread of the new variants do not appear to have prompted an equivalent surge in hospitalisations, and severe disease, though another 114 deaths were reported on Friday, bringing the official total to 100,744. Joe Phaahla, the South African health minister, said vaccines remained the best defence against the virus and denied that the country's vaccination effort had struggled to meet even modest objectives. Just under 50% of the adult population of about 40 million have received at least one dose of vaccine, with only 45% of adults fully vaccinated. More than two-thirds of the population are thought to have some immunity based on past exposure to the virus. In the US, health authorities have reported that coronavirus cases are surging in most counties in New York State, putting them on a high alert status under the national health guidelines which include recommendations for wearing masks indoors, including schools. By Thursday, new cases stood at more than 10,000 a day, a 47% increase in two weeks, with hospitalisations rising by 28% over that time period to more than 2,600 a day. About 77% of people are fully vaccinated in New York State, a figure that rises to 79% in New York City. Last week, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reclassified Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 as 'variants of concern' and said they threatened a significant overall increase in Covid-19 cases in the EU in the coming weeks and months but not any 'significant increase in infection severity'.", "f532ea644418919dff2ce4b290dbfdb24b7704c4c58a6b2dc44ac60d": "Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil company, has disclosed an 82% rise in quarterly profits to a new record of $39.5bn (PS32.2bn), boosted by an increase in demand and higher crude prices. The company, which last week overtook technology group Apple to become the world's most valuable company, said it would pay an $18.8bn (PS15.3bn) dividend and hand $4bn (PS3.2bn) in bonus shares to its investors after the better-than-expected performance. Energy companies such as BP and Shell have posted their highest profits in at least a decade as a result of rising commodities prices fuelled by the unwinding of Covid-19 restrictions around the world and sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. Energy prices have also been driven by strong demand in Asia for gas and a cold winter in 2020 which depleted supplies, leaving stocks low as temperatures dropped in the northern hemisphere last year. Profits have risen despite many groups taking a hit from exiting investments in Russia as Brent crude prices have soared by almost 70% to $107.91 (PS87.99) a barrel in March compared with a year before. BP said this month its profits more than doubled to $6.2bn (PS5bn) in the first three months of the year. Shell has reported a record quarterly profit of $9.1bn (PS7.3bn) for the first three months of the year. OPEC+, the producers group which includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Russia, agreed this month to a modest increase in its monthly oil output target, but has said it is not possible for other producers to replace Russian exports of more than 7m barrels a day. Aramco has a particularly low cost of production, as much of its oil is in easy-to-tap fields onshore or in shallow waters. That boosts profitability at the company, which is still 95%-owned by the Saudi government. Amin H Nasser, president and chief executive of Aramco, said the company was helping to meet world demand for reliable and affordable energy against a backdrop of 'increased volatility'.  'Energy security is vital and we are investing for the long term, expanding our oil and gas production capacity to meet anticipated demand growth,' he said. 'As we collaborate with domestic and international partners to explore new and emerging technologies and solutions, from developing cleaner transport technologies to establishing low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia value chains, I am more optimistic than ever about the positive contribution we can make, both to our customers and to the ongoing global energy transition.'", "59879b67a56c79aad91682c8d83d5127980d2869fad65a64d6dd3b78": "", "a68671a9c969e2700d766e2c301b2330ffe83ff0a18075b70ea68c37": "", "4a0a55bc8e73acf97f07af220edfaefd1d87d586cdfcbf32446f2a43": "The war against Russia will reach a turning point by mid-August and be over by the end of the year, Ukraine's head of military intelligence has told Sky News. Major general Kyrylo Budanov said: He said Russia was suffering huge losses - although he would not be drawn on Ukrainian casualties - and said he was not surprised by their scale, given Russian power was a 'myth'. Budanov said Russian forces attacking the north-eastern city of Kharkiv had been pushed back almost to the Russian border and that their much-reported failure to cross the Siverskyi Donets river several days ago had resulted in 'heavy losses'. He also claimed that Russian defeat in Ukraine would lead to the removal of Russian president Vladimir Putin and that a coup was already under way against him. 'They are moving in this way and it is impossible to stop it,' he said. He provided no evidence to support the claim. Furthermore, Putin was in a 'very bad psychological and physical condition and he is very sick'. Rumours of Putin's ill health have circulated recently but the Guardian has been unable to substantiate them. Interfax quotes Grushko as saying: He also reiterated the Kremlin's earlier statement that Moscow's response to Nato's possible expansion would depend on how close the alliance moves military assets towards Russia and what infrastructure it deploys. Finland's plan to apply for membership, announced on Thursday, and the expectation that Sweden will follow, would bring about the expansion of the western military alliance the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, aimed to prevent. Russia will act if Nato deploys nuclear forces and infrastructure closer to its border, the state-run RIA news agency quotes deputy foreign minister Alexander Grushko as saying. Grushko claims to have no hostile intentions towards Finland and Sweden and to see no 'real' reasons for those two countries to join the defence alliance. More than 700,000 people fleeing the war in Ukraine have been recorded in Germany thus far, Welt am Sonntag newspaper has reported, citing interior ministry data. Since the start of the war on 24 February until 11 May, 727,205 people have registered in Germany's central register of foreigners (AZR), of which 93% hold Ukrainian citizenship, Welt reported, according to Reuters. A significant number may have travelled on to other European Union countries or returned to Ukraine, it said. Around 40% of Ukrainian refugees were minors and women make up 81% of the adult refugees registered, Welt added. The Russian invasion has triggered a massive displacement of people, including more than 8 million Ukrainians within the country, according to the latest International Organization for Migration (IOM) report. The number of people who have fled Ukraine has passed 6 million, in Europe's worst refugee crisis since the end of the srcond world war, a UN refugee agency said on Thursday. In case you'd missed it, Italy is set to host the Grand Final of the Eurovision song contest later on Saturday - and Ukraine is the favourite to win. Kalush Orchestra, a band that blends traditional folk and hip-hop, is competing in the event with the song Stefania, which has become an anthem at home, the Guardian's Rome correspondent Angela Giuffrida reported earlier this week. Written by frontman Oleh Psiuk as a tribute to his mother, Stefania is also the most watched on YouTube among the 35 contenders. But in an interview with the Italian news agency Ansa, Psiuk said his band's entry was tipped to do well even before Russia invaded in February. 'Some people are saying we could win because of the war, but our song was among the five favourites before the start of the conflict, which means people like it regardless,' he said. Russia has been banned from competing this year. Read more here: Ukraine already has 40 suspects and 11,000 cases in its war crimes investigation, prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova has said. Her comments came after Kyiv heard its first war crimes trial since the invasion began in February.  Vadim Shysimarin, a commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, is accused of shooting dead an unarmed man on a bicycle, after being ordered 'to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders', according to prosecutors.

Rumours of Putin's ill health have circulated recently but the Guardian has been unable to substantiate them. The fact that Russia has only succeeded in imposing a pro-Russia local leadership in the city of Kherson 'highlights the failure of Russia's invasion to make progress towards its political objectives in Ukraine,' the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said in its latest intelligence update. The Russian-controlled administration in Kherson said it planned to request annexation by Moscow on Wednesday. Russia occupied Kherson in March and seized its city council building in late April. The occupation was met with protests by residents, despite violent attempts by Russian forces to disperse them. The MoD said a central part of Russia's original invasion plan had highly likely been to 'use rigged referendums to place the majority of Ukraine's regions under long-term pro-Russian authority.' India is banning wheat exports in a bid to protect the country's food security, the government has said. The 'sudden spike' in global wheat prices put the food security of India, neighbouring and other vulnerable countries at risk, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade said. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat and other food products. Its invasion by Russia has sparked warnings of a global food crisis.  G7 foreign and agricultural ministers are currently meeting in Germany to discuss ways of breaking Russia's blockade of Ukrainian grain exports from ports including Odesa.  Before the war, most of the food produced by Ukraine - enough to feed 400 million people - was exported through the country's seven Black Sea ports.  Senior Russian lawmaker Anna Kuznetsova visited the Russian-occupied region of Kherson in Ukraine to discuss social and healthcare needs of the local population, the state RIA news agency reported on Saturday according to Reuters. There have been sparse confirmed reports of Russian senior officials visiting areas of fighting since Russia invaded its neighbour on 24 February. Kherson is the first region set to be annexed after Moscow said in April it had gained full control of the region, which has seen sporadic anti-Russian protests. Kuznetsova, deputy head of Russia's Duma or lower house of parliament, discussed the supply of foodstuffs as well as medical and other products needed for children, RIA reported. 'We are here ready to provide all kinds of assistance,' Kuznetsova, the wife of an Orthodox priest and mother of seven was quoted saying. The agency did not report when the visit took place. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Kherson, home to a port city of the same name, provides part of the land link between the Crimean peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014, and Russian-backed separatist areas in eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin said it was up to residents living in the region to decide whether they wanted to join Russia. Russian forces in the Kharkiv region have not been engaging in active combat, the Ukrainian general staff has said in its latest update on the conflict. Their main efforts were instead 'focused on ensuring the withdrawal of troops from the city of Kharkiv, maintaining occupied positions and supply routes.' In the southern port city of Mariupol, Russia was continuing to blockade the last remaining Ukrainian forces in the Azovstal steel plant, it said, and was using 'mass artillery and air strikes'. In the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk Ukrainian forces had repelled ten Russian attacks and destroyed equipment including five tanks, five artillery systems, and six units of combat armoured equipment, the general staff said. 'Very difficult negotiations' are underway on the next stage of evacuations from Mariupol and the Azovstal steel plant, where the city's last remaining Ukrainian defenders are holed up, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest nightly address. Russian forces have intensified their bombardment of steelworks, where many of the fighters are thought to be injured. Recent evacuees have described hellish conditions in the network of underground bunkers there. Zelenskiy also warned that the war and Russia's blockade of Ukraine's ports were 'provoking a large-scale food crisis'. His warning came as G7 foreign and agriculture ministers were meeting in Germany to discuss ways of breaking the Russian blockade of grain exports. Zelenskiy also claimed that Russia had lost almost 27,000 soldiers, 'many of them young conscripts', and that Ukraine had downed a 200th Russian military aircraft. Russia had also 'lost more than three thousand tanks, armored combat vehicles, a large number of conventional military vehicles, helicopters, drones and all its prospects as a state.' The Guardian is not able to verify Ukraine's claims regarding Russian losses and Moscow has provided very little detail. Ukraine has 'likely won the battle of Kharkiv', the country's second largest city, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest assessment of the conflict. Russian units had 'generally not attempted to hold ground against counterattacking Ukrainian forces over the past several days, with a few exceptions.' The US-based think tank said Ukraine would now likely 'attempt to disrupt ground lines of communication (GLOCs) between Belgorod [in Russia] and Russian forces concentrated around [the Russian-occupied city of] Izyum, although Russia is using several GLOCs, including some further away from current Ukrainian positions than any Ukrainian counteroffensive is likely to reach soon.' Russian troops had 'made no progress' with an attempted ground offensive from Izyum, it continued, adding: 'We had previously hypothesized that Russia might give up on attempts to advance from Izyum, but the Russians have either not made such a decision or have not fully committed to it yet.' Meanwhile, it said, the main Russian effort was aimed at encircling the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk. Other key takeaways included: As the time approaches 8am in Kyiv, here's a round up of the latest developments. This is Helen Livingstone bringing you all the latest news on the war in Ukraine. ", "72ece66c0edc0320e2bf55c2a1a1b0db7ef7c8c8df8a17bb4a5a3202": "Ukrainian forces 'appear to have won the battle of Kharkiv', according to a US defence thinktank, in what appears to be their fastest advance since Russian troops pulled away from Kyiv and the north-east over a month ago. In another apparent setback to Vladimir Putin's war aims, analysts said on Saturday that Russian units had not attempted to hold their lines against counterattacking Ukrainian troops around the city. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city and only 31 miles (50km) from the Russian border, has been under enemy bombardment since the war began in February. But the US-based Institute for the Study of War said in its latest assessment of the conflict that the Russians appeared to be dropping back and aimed to replace their own troops with proxy forces or mercenaries. 'Ukraine thus appears to have won the battle of Kharkiv,' the institute said. 'Ukrainian forces prevented Russian troops from encircling, let alone seizing Kharkiv, and then expelled them from around the city, as they did to Russian forces attempting to seize Kyiv.' Russian units had 'generally not attempted to hold ground against counterattacking Ukrainian forces over the past several days, with a few exceptions'. 'Reports from western officials and a video from an officer of the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) indicate that Moscow is focused on conducting an orderly withdrawal and prioritizing getting Russians back home before allowing proxy forces to enter Russia rather than trying to hold its positions near the city.' Ukraine now controls territory stretching to the Siverskyi Donets river, around 25 miles (40km) to the east of the city. 'We are entering a new, long phase of the war,' the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said in a Facebook post on Friday night, predicting 'extremely tough weeks' ahead during which he said Ukraine would largely be alone against an 'enraged aggressor'. However, Moscow is still bombarding villages north of Kharkiv. Some six miles north of the city, firefighters doused smouldering wreckage in Dergachi after what local officials said was an overnight Russian missile attack on the House of Culture, used to distribute aid. Volunteers inside were trying to salvage packages of baby diapers and formula. 'I can't call it anything but a terrorist act,' the mayor, Vyacheslav Zadorenko, told Reuters. 'They wanted to hit the base where we store provisions and create a humanitarian catastrophe.' Earlier on Friday, British defence intelligence said Russia had lost 'significant armoured manoeuvre elements' from a battalion tactical group - usually around 800 strong - in a failed attempt to cross a strategically important river in the Donbas, to the south-east of Kharkiv. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said Russian forces had been repulsed three times as they tried to cross the Siverskyi Donets River, losing armour and bridging equipment. 'We have eliminated Russian speedboats and helicopters, which they used to cover their attempts,' the governor added, while aerial photography showed destroyed pontoon bridges and armour by the riverbanks. Ukraine's defence ministry tweeted pictures of a smashed pontoon bridge and destroyed armoured vehicles in Bilohorivka on Wednesday, describing them as showing victims of 'artillerymen of the 17th tank brigade'. Analysts believe Russian attempts to gain territory in the Donbas are increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost town held by Ukrainian forces - and the Russian forces were trying to cross the river in an attempt to cut off the town. However, the Institute of War said the Russians had 'made no progress' with an attempted ground offensive from Izium, and that the Kremlin might not have enough troops to complete an encirclement of Severodonetsk. 'The Russians may not have enough additional fresh combat power to offset those losses and continue the offensive on a large enough scale to complete the encirclement, although they will likely continue to try to do so,' the institute said.

'Anatoly Bibilov signed a decree on holding a referendum in the Republic of South Ossetia,' his office said in a statement, citing his people's 'historic aspiration' to join Russia. South Ossetia was at the centre of the Russian-Georgian war in 2008 after which the Kremlin recognised the territory - along with another separatist region, Abkhazia - as an independent state and stationed military bases there. 'We are coming home,' Bibilov said on messaging app Telegram. 'The time has come to unite once and for all. 'South Ossetia and Russia will be together. This is the start of a big new story.' Bibilov lost his bid for re-election earlier this month. Russia has expressed hope the incoming leader, Alan Gagloev, will preserve 'continuity' in ties with Moscow. The announcement came on the 79th day of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine, with thousands killed and more than six million people fleeing the pro-western country. Ukraine's separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk have also expressed interest in joining Russia. The full-scale offensive on Ukraine has sparked an outpouring of solidarity in Georgia. Georgia has previously denounced as 'unacceptable' plans by South Ossetia to hold a referendum on joining Russia. In August 2008, Russia launched an assault against Georgia, which was battling pro-Russian militia in South Ossetia, after they shelled Georgian villages. The fighting ended five days later with a European Union-mediated ceasefire, but claimed more than 700 lives and displaced tens of thousands of ethnic Georgians.", "eabf49d442d9cf2f696da72781d795ec195c2c785f482150e290d1a8": "When Prof Gavin Brown, pro vice-chancellor at Liverpool University, first made contact with academics at Sumy State University (SSU) in north-eastern Ukraine a few weeks ago, he did not expect to come off the call and start ordering new windows. One of SSU's main buildings had been destroyed in a Russian bomb attack. Among the university's many immediate needs, it had to replace 110 windows - but managers could not source glass in war-torn Ukraine. Brown told them to send him the measurements. Liverpool is one of 44 British universities that have signed up in recent weeks to 'twin' with a struggling Ukrainian university. UK academics say the weekly Zoom meetings, slotted in around air raid sirens, with female staff who have fled calling in from across Europe, are 'humbling' and 'emotional'. The idea is to make sure that when the war with Russia ends, Ukraine's universities will still exist, so their staff and students can help rebuild the battered country. Fortunately, Liverpool University happens to have its own building company with connections to glass manufacturers, and Brown has heard that supplies like this are making it across Ukraine. 'This is about understanding what these universities need and offering real, practical help,' he says.  The challenges do not stop here. 'Many female staff have left and are trying to do what work they can from a distance. Many male staff are fighting,' Brown says. Universities at the sharp end of the invasion in eastern Ukraine believe all their female students have fled the region, with many leaving the country. But the universities do not want to lose them. Liverpool plans to share online teaching materials to keep SSU students engaged. The university may also take in some of the staff, helping them to put lectures and lab experiments online for their colleagues at home. Brown emphasises his university will be a temporary base and when the time is right, the staff will return. 'It is clearly a fear of the Ukrainian universities that there will be a brain drain,' he says. Liverpool, unlike some western universities, has deliberately not offered scholarships to fleeing Ukrainian students who may want to transfer. Brown says that if recipients decide not to go back this would do significant harm. 'The whole point of what we are doing is to try to support Sumy students to continue to study with their own university,' he says. 'They will be critical in helping with the rebuilding of Ukraine.' Kyiv National University of Technologies and Design has told its new twin, Sheffield Hallam University, that the main help needed is with motivating their displaced students to study again. James Richardson, director of global development and partnerships at Sheffield Hallam, says this is no small task as students fleeing the war will have more immediate priorities than resuming their course. And, crucially, the university does not know where most of them are. 'We understand pretty much all of their female staff have left Kyiv or have left Ukraine altogether. This has resulted in them having no functional administration,' he says. In Kyiv, air raid sirens go off every day and night. Richardson's main contact at the Ukrainian university has to schedule meetings around when he is next on patrol. 'I know staff who are still there are cold,' Richardson says. 'The first call we had, they said it was -3C at night and they are in unheated cellars. From outside we might think things are quieter in Kyiv, but they feel very much under attack.' The two universities have many overlapping courses, and Sheffield Hallam wants to share resources such as online lectures, recorded during the pandemic. Many of the Ukrainian students speak English, so language will not be a significant barrier. 'The biggest challenge is going to be connecting with the students to tell them about it,' he says. Richardson hopes to bring staff and students at both universities together on virtual projects in the autumn. However, he says: 'Right now they aren't really functioning so it will be hard to offer much other than our support. But we are in this for the long term, planning for next year and a long way beyond.' Their last Zoom call, which 12 Ukrainian academics joined from across Ukraine and Europe, was 'emotional'. Richardson says: 'I think it meant a lot to them to know there is another institution that is simply there for them.' 'This is about giving them hope,' he adds. 'It is a reminder that they are fighting for something important. Universities are a huge part of their social and cultural fabric, as well as their economic future.' Charles Cormack, founder of Cormack Consultancy Group, which is running the twinning scheme alongside the vice-chancellors' group Universities UK, says what UK universities are doing is listening to what their Ukrainian colleagues need. 'At the meetings I've been involved in you just don't hear the word 'no'.' York University has twinned with Karazin Kharkiv National University, one of Ukraine's most prestigious institutions, whose buildings are in ruins from shelling. Prof Saul Tendler, deputy vice-chancellor at York, says one of the Ukrainian university's many worries is protecting its libraries and archive collections. 'They tell us they are in damp basements now and that's not great,' he says. 'If they can get them out of the country, we will hold them in our repositories.' Like other universities, York is exploring offering summer schools for Ukrainian students, either in the city or virtually. Karazin also wants York to run summer sessions for its staff on moving teaching online, likely to be necessary for some time given the condition of the university's buildings. However, even communicating can be a challenge. Tendler says: 'They are enduring unbelievable suffering, spending large parts of their lives in bomb shelters.' Karazin's leaders have said the collaboration must be 'one good deed at a time', because of the stresses they are under. As Tendler says: 'You'd love to be able to wrap your arms around them and do lots of things very fast, but actually right now they can't cope with that.' Glasgow University has been asked by its twin, the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, to provide up to 100 places for female students across a range of disciplines to study at Glasgow for the first semester next year. The Scottish university plans to waive all fees and is exploring what accommodation and extra financial support it can offer.  Rachel Sandison, deputy vice-chancellor for external engagement, says her conversations with Ukrainian colleagues are 'humbling' and 'heartbreaking', but she takes solace from knowing they are doing some good. Richardson, at Sheffield Hallam, says: 'When this is all over, if there were no Ukrainian universities because buildings have been destroyed and staff and students have just left, it would take generations to rebuild.'", "f859d46f1c3cede4dc19b0a7ebd76eda3b84f9058671651ccbe6208e": "", "c7a6601810ba4719f8eb5fc72e8d66c36dda07198bb8d8efb8c8cd2d": "Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. Russian president Vladimir Putin led anniversary celebrations of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany on Monday, as Russian forces intensified attacks on Ukraine in one of the deadliest conflicts in Europe since the second world war. Daniel Boffey and Isobel Koshiw reported on anniversary festivities, including a fly-past over the nine domes of St Basil's Cathedral in Moscow with supersonic fighters, strategic bombers and, for the first time since 2010, the Il-80 'doomsday' command plane, which would carry Russia's top brass in the event of a nuclear war. The parade came two days after Russian forces bombed a village school in eastern Ukraine, killing 60 people. Putin has repeatedly likened the war in Ukraine to the challenge the Soviet Union faced when Adolf Hitler invaded in 1941. He told Russian soldiers they were 'fighting for the same thing their fathers and grandfathers did', using his Victory Day speech to justify his invasion of Ukraine. Shaun Walker analysed Putin's list of grievances with the west, and noted that this year the invasion of Ukraine has made his message harder to stomach, even for many of his fans. In an episode of Today in Focus, Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth told Michael Safi that the speech was revealing of Putin's dilemma - one that could make or break his presidency and his legacy in Russia. If he escalates the conflict, he stands more chance of winning the kind of victory he initially hoped for. But should that fail, he would face humiliation. Alternatively, he could claim victory now and seek to de-escalate the conflict. But would a limited, compromised declaration of victory be regarded as anything but a retreat? Russian bombardment of Ukraine had intensified ahead of the parade, including a direct hit on a school in eastern Ukraine that killed dozens of people, Daniel Boffey and Isobel Koshiw report. After two months sheltering in besieged Mariupol, civilians arrived in Ukraine-held Zaporizhzhia, exhausted and with few possessions, reports Emma Graham-Harrison. The last civilians rescued from the besieged Azovstal steel plant complex in Mariupol reached safety in Ukrainian-held territory late on Sunday. The convoy arrived in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia after dark, carrying about 170 evacuees. There were 51 civilians who had been sheltering in the Azovstal complex, and about 120 others who had walked or hitched lifts across the city to a pickup point in a ruined shopping mall. The journey of just over 200km (124 miles) took two days, as the convoy of buses was held for hours at Russian checkpoints and the hungry, weary residents inside were interrogated. 'I didn't think we would make it out alive, so I don't have any plans for my future,' said Natalia, who worked at the Azovstal plant and sheltered for more than two months in its network of bunkers. She had fled with little more than a collection of drawings made by children in their shelter; she had organised drawing competitions to occupy them and kept the pictures to remember. 'I wouldn't have given them up even if they shot me.' When the soldiers of an elite Russian army brigade were told in early April to prepare for a second deployment to Ukraine, fear broke out among the ranks, writes Pjotr Sauer. The unit, stationed in Russia's far east during peacetime, first entered Ukraine from Belarus when the war started. But after returning to Russia in the wake of the botched initial attack, they refused when they were told they were supposed to go back for another tour at the front. 'It soon became clear that not everyone was onboard with it. Many of us simply did not want to go back,' said Dmitri, a member of the unit who asked not to be identified with his real name. 'I want to return to my family - and not in a casket.' Along with eight others, Dmitri told his commanders that he refused to rejoin the invasion. 'They were furious. But they eventually calmed down because there wasn't much they could do,' he said. Dmitri's refusal to fight highlights some of the military difficulties the Russian army has faced as a result of the Kremlin's political decision not to formally declare war on Ukraine - preferring instead to describe the invasion, which will soon reach its fourth month, as a 'special military operation'. On Wednesday, Daniel Boffey and Pjotr Sauer had an exclusive story revealing that three Russian prisoners of war accused of targeting or murdering civilians, and a soldier who allegedly killed a man before raping his wife, are set to be in the dock in the first war crimes trials of the Ukraine conflict. More than 10,700 crimes have been registered since the war began by the office of Ukraine's prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, and a handful of cases have now been filed or are ready to be submitted in what marks a watershed moment two months into the war. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, who is in Ukrainian custody, appeared in a Kyiv court on Friday as the first to face trial over his alleged murder of a 68-year-old man. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of driving a stolen car with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters and then shooting dead the unarmed man on a bicycle as he was talking on his phone. Shysimarin was ordered 'to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders', according to prosecutors. The aim was to be the invisible man, says Igor Pedin, 61. It was to drift, as if a ghost, with his small trolley bag of supplies and dog Zhu-Zhu, a nine-year-old mongrel terrier, through the hellscape of the besieged port city of Mariupol, out into the badlands of Russian-occupied territories and on to the relative safety of the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia - a mere 225km walk away. Pedin sidestepped mines and crossed destroyed bridges with his dog and luggage, passing smouldering homes and weeping men and women with heartbreaking stories of death and suffering. He also had to contend with nervous, trigger-happy Russian soldiers. But miraculously he made it and has told Daniel Boffey his extraordinary story.

State media said 174,440 people were newly found with fever symptoms on Friday alone as the country scrambles to slow the spread of Covid-19 across its unvaccinated population. North Korea said on Saturday that a total of 27 people have died and 524,440 fell ill amid a rapid spread of fever since late April. It said 280,810 people remain in quarantine. State media did not specifically say how many of the fever cases and deaths were confirmed as Covid-19 cases. During a meeting on anti-virus strategies on Saturday, Kim described the outbreak as a historically 'huge disruption' and called for unity between the government and people to stabilise the outbreak as quickly as possible. The meeting discussed 'promptly distributing emergency drugs' and introducing 'scientific treatment tactics and treatment methods for different patients, including those with special constitutions', KCNA reported. Kim said he had 'faith that we can overcome this malicious infectious disease within the shortest period possible,' the report added. The country imposed nationwide lockdowns on Thursday after confirming its first Covid-19 infections since the start of the pandemic. Kim said they would be following the Chinese model of virus prevention. 'We should take lessons from the experiences and fruitful achievements in preventing virus of the China's Communist party and its people,' he said. State media said tests of virus samples collected Sunday from an unspecified number of people with fevers in the country's capital, Pyongyang, confirmed they were infected with the Omicron variant. The country has so far officially confirmed one death as linked to an Omicron infection. Experts say a failure to control the spread of Covid could have devastating consequences in North Korea, considering the country's poor healthcare system and that its 26 million people are largely unvaccinated. North Korea has so far shunned offers of Covid vaccines from China and Russia, and via the World Health Organization's Covax scheme, apparently because administering the jabs would require outside monitoring. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the regime's public acknowledgment of coronavirus cases meant 'the public health situation must be serious'.

A coalition of groups such as Planned Parenthood, UltraViolet, MoveOn and the Women's March are organizing Saturday's demonstrations, whose rallying cry is 'Bans Off Our Bodies'. More than 370 protests are planned, including in Washington DC, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. The demonstrations come after the leak on 2 May of a draft opinion showing five conservatives on the nine-justice supreme court had voted to reverse their predecessors' ruling in Roe v Wade nearly 50 years ago. Unless the provisional ruling is changed substantially before becoming final, abortion would be outlawed essentially immediately in more than half of US states. People in those 26 states hostile to abortion would be forced to either travel hundreds of miles to a clinic in a state where terminating a pregnancy is legal or seek to self-administer an abortion through medication from grassroots or illicit groups. While conservatives have celebrated the leak ruling, liberals have objected vociferously, gathering outside the supreme court building in Washington DC as well as the homes of some of the conservative justices to signal their displeasure. Those rallies - generally peaceful - have been relatively small, while Saturday's planned events will almost certainly be compared to the 2017 Women's March the day after Donald Trump was inaugurated as president, which drew an estimated 3 million to 4 million participants across the US. The 'Bans Off Our Bodies' gatherings will take place three days after Democrats in the US Senate on Wednesday made a largely symbolic effort to advance legislation that would codify the right to an abortion into federal law. All 50 Republicans and one conservative-aligned Democrat - West Virginia's Joe Manchin - voted against the measure, leaving it well short of the 60 votes necessary for it to advance.", "519fab2c53b7379b40a98b85f7400830f7a0c8e22ff569c87e25ee8b": "The UN security council has unanimously condemned the killing of the Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh while covering an Israeli army raid in the occupied West Bank, diplomats said. In a rare, unanimous statement the security council also called for 'an immediate, thorough, transparent and impartial investigation into her killing'. According to diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity, the negotiations on the text were particularly arduous. China successfully pushed the US to remove paragraphs denouncing abuses committed against the media around the world, defending their freedom and urging their protection while covering military operations, according to diplomatic sources and different versions of the declaration obtained by AFP during the discussions. The final text merely says 'journalists should be protected as civilians' and does not mention violence during the funeral on Friday for Abu Akleh. Earlier, the US said it was 'deeply troubled to see the images of Israeli police intruding into her funeral procession'. Joe Biden's secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: 'Every family deserves to be able to lay their loved ones to rest in a dignified and unimpeded manner.' The EU said it was 'appalled by the violence in the St Joseph hospital compound and the level of unnecessary force exercised by Israeli police throughout the funeral procession'. The UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, was also 'deeply disturbed' by the violence, according to a spokesperson. Television footage showed pallbearers struggling to stop Abu Akleh's coffin from falling to the ground as Israeli police officers charged at them, grabbing Palestinian flags from mourners. Abu Akleh, a star journalist for Al Jazeera, was killed as she covered unrest in the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. The Qatar-based network alleged she was deliberately targeted by Israel. The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, initially said armed Palestinians were 'likely' responsible, but Israel has since rowed back and said it was investigating.", "8f3f1150baf43f82f15ccd68b48ec11f484d6221d5003e51bf43122d": "At least 27 people have died and dozens more were injured in a huge fire in a commercial building in India's capital, Delhi. The large fire broke out at the four-storey building near a railway station in the western suburb of Mundka in the late afternoon on Friday, but its cause was not immediately clear. Television footage showed smoke billowing out of the windows of the building, with firefighters helping those trapped in the upper floors to escape as hundreds watched. More than 30 fire trucks were at the scene, along with ambulances. 'Twenty-seven charred bodies were recovered from the building and almost two dozen injured are undergoing treatment,' said Satpal Bharadwaj, who was in charge of operations for the Delhi fire service at the scene. The fire broke out in the first floor of the building that houses the office of a surveillance camera manufacturing company, police said. On Saturday, police said they'd arrested two owners of the company. The police registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and a criminal conspiracy that is punishable with life imprisonment or 10 years in jail. The building had no clearance from the fire department and it was not equipped with fire safety equipment like extinguishers, said Atul Garg, the director of the Delhi fire service. Bharadwaj said there were about 70 people in the building when the blaze erupted. 'There was no fire exit and most of the people died due to asphyxiation,' Bharadwaj said, adding that more would be known after autopsies could be conducted. The deputy chief fire officer, Sunil Choudhary, said the number of injured stood at 'more than 25 people'. Choudhary added that some had jumped from the burning building. Broadcaster NDTV, meanwhile, reported that more than 40 people had sustained burns and were hospitalised. Amit Mahajan, whose cousin and nephew were missing after the fire, said they had been at the building to 'train workers'. 'I have visited all the nearby hospitals but there is no trace of them. We are not sure about their safety or whereabouts,' he said. Fires are common in India due to poor building practices, overcrowding and a lack of adherence to safety regulations. The Indian capital of 20 million people is currently suffering through a heatwave, with temperatures of up to 46C recorded in some places. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, offered condolences on Twitter. 'Extremely saddened by the loss of lives due to a tragic fire in Delhi. My thoughts are with the bereaved families. I wish the injured a speedy recovery,' Modi said. The Delhi chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, tweeted: 'Shocked and pained to know abt this tragic incident. I am constantly in touch [with] officers. Our brave firemen are trying their best to control the fire and save lives.'

In a statement to the Guardian, the inspector general's office of the justice department confirmed that the subpoena was issued in February 2021 - shortly after Biden entered the White House. The action was taken in an effort to divine the identity of an alleged leaker, who was suspected of divulging to news outlets details of an inquiry into the previous Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the southern US border. On Thursday, it emerged that the DoJ had secretly used a subpoena to confirm the phone number of Stephanie Kirchgaessner, the Guardian's investigations correspondent. She had been the author of two reports in 2020 that revealed sensitive aspects of the child separation policy, including that Donald Trump's then deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein had given the green light for children of any age to be removed from their parents. It was unclear at that point which administration had been responsible for issuing the subpoena, as the leak inquiry had straddled both the Trump and Biden administrations. Now the inspector general's office of the DoJ has clarified that the move was made under the Biden administration. Stephanie Logan, spokesperson for the inspector general's office which acts as the DoJ's internal watchdog and which was conducting the child separation inquiry, told the Guardian that the subpoena had been issued in February 2021 in compliance with 'the requirements of the Justice Manual'. The subpoena, she said, had been issued to a telecommunications company to confirm that 'one specific telephone number already known to investigators ... in fact belonged to a specific media outlet'. Investigators knew the phone number - Kirchgaessner's, though Logan did not refer to the reporter by name - from their previous review of the phone records of an official in the inspector general's office suspected of being the source of the leak.  Logan stressed that 'the subpoena did not request, and investigators did not receive, the content of communications to or from the account holder's phone number' or any other other details of the phone account. The disclosure of the use of a subpoena to confirm a Guardian reporter's phone number in a case that involved no national security concerns or classified information provoked strong criticism. The Guardian's editor-in-chief Katharine Viner called the DoJ's action 'an egregious example of infringement on press freedom and public interest journalism'. In July 2021, the DoJ under Biden's newly-appointed attorney general Merrick Garland announced a new policy that promised to restrict the use of 'compulsory process to obtain information from, or records of, members of the news media acting within the scope of news gathering activities'. Advocates for increased federal protections for the press have complained however that there has been lackluster support from the Biden administration for stronger shield laws. Last summer Ron Wyden, the US senator from Oregon, introduced new legislation to protect reporters from unnecessary government surveillance as a response to revelations about the Trump administration's heavy-handed surveillance of journalists at CNN, the New York Times and other outlets. Wyden told the Freedom of the Press Foundation at the time that he had tried to enlist the support of the justice department for his new Press Act, but officials within the Biden administration had failed to engage.", "58f882bc2db28b31ed3468063b27570e8bf9270698e10a4e625cdbec": "The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has tested positive for Covid-19 and will have to isolate for another week in what she called a 'very Kiwi experience'. Days after announcing the relaxation of the country's tight border controls, Ardern developed symptoms on Friday evening and returned a positive test before another positive result from a rapid antigen test on Saturday morning, her office said in a statement. Her symptoms are said to be moderate. Her partner, Clarke Gayford, tested positive last Sunday and Ardern has been in quarantine since then. She will have to isolate until the morning of Saturday 21 May and will not be in parliament in the coming week when her government has two set-piece events in the emissions reduction plan on Monday and the budget on Thursday.  Ardern will carry out some duties remotely but her deputy, Grant Robertson, will take the regular post-cabinet press conference on Monday. 'This is a milestone week for the government and I'm gutted I can't be there for it,' Ardern said. 'Our emissions reduction plan sets the path to achieve our carbon zero goal and the budget addresses the long-term future and security of New Zealand's health system.

Marcos Jr, the son and namesake of the late dictator, won a landslide victory in Monday's presidential election, an outcome that has appalled those who survived his father's regime. Images released by the family showed Marcos Jr visiting the home of his mother, Imelda, who had displayed Picasso's Femme Couche VI (Reclining Woman VI), or a replica, above the sofa. It is unclear if the painting, one of eight targeted for seizure by anti-corruption authorities in 2014, is genuine, but the unexpected appearance of the nude in blues and greens reclining on an orange and yellow bed has added to fears the family will use its now-increased power to brazenly further stifle efforts to recover ill-gotten wealth. Marcos Sr presided over rife human rights abuses during his 20-year rule, including the arrest, torture and killings of his opponent, and used his power to plunder as much as $10bn until he was deposed in 1986. The family squirrelled away the funds in overseas bank accounts and real estate, and splashed out on jewellery, artworks and designer clothes. Imelda, the dynasty's matriarch, became infamous for her enormous shoe collection - a symbol of the family's excess and greed. The family and its backers have since rebranded the Marcos name, with disinformation about Marcos Sr's rule spread widely online. Ruben Carranza, a former commissioner for the presidential commission on good government (PCGG), which was set up to investigate and recover ill-gotten wealth, said it was unclear if the painting was a genuine Picasso. 'Mrs Marcos has had a habit of buying fake paintings, as well as lending fake paintings for display,' Carranza said. But he added: 'The fact that she's now displaying it just shows not just the duplicity of Mrs Marcos - but that she has to display the duplicity and the extravagance that she thinks she's displaying for Filipinos to see ... That says something even worse.' He added: 'It shows this really, absolutely uncaring attitude for Filipinos. They've not only now been led to believe that [the Marcoses] have gold. Now, they're leading them to believe, again, that they have so much wealth that they can just display it whenever they please,' said Carranza. For years, there has been speculation online that the Marcoses have huge sums of gold, which was given to Marcos Sr by a wealthy family as payment for acting as their lawyer. According to the story, the gold would be shared with the people if the family regained power. Marcos Jr has either downplayed or denied the abuses that occurred in the Phlippines under his father. As president, he would have the power to appoint the commissioners of the PCGG, granting him huge influence over the body that was set up to recover the family's wealth. The PCGG has reportedly retrieved about $5bn, while a further $2.4bn was bogged down in litigation, and more remains missing, according to recent reports. The Picasso was supposed to have been seized by the government in 2014, but a former commissioner on good government, Andres Bautista, told the Rappler news site co-founded by the Nobel peace prize winner Maria Ressa that he believed the item was a fake. 'Personally I know that what we seized was a fake. It was a tarpaulin so it's still with them,' he told the site. The Marcos family continues to face dozens of court cases over their plundered wealth. Imelda is appealing against a 2018 criminal conviction on seven corruption charges. Marcos Jr's spokesperson, Vic Rodriguez, did not respond when asked during a press conference to clarify whether the artwork on display in the Marcos home was genuine.", "7803ebd32d2940967adfd47e5165250ec4f5bab3916eb2296773127f": "Standing seven storeys tall in Mayfair's Hanover Square - a short walk from Savile Row, Oxford Street and Michelin-starred restaurants - there is little mistaking Vogue House for what it is: the home of the fashion bible's British edition. However, a six-hour drive away, a pub in the Cornish countryside has become a site for concern for bosses at the fashion giant. Despite the pub having stood for hundreds of years, the landlords have been asked to rename it. The Star Inn at Vogue, named for the hamlet in which it is situated, has received a message from the magazine's owner asking for the change because, it says, a link between the two businesses 'is likely to be inferred'. In a cease-and-desist letter, Conde Nast's chief operating officer, Sabine Vandenbroucke, argued that the company was the proprietor of the Vogue mark, not only for the magazine first published in 1916 but for 'other goods and services offered to the public by our company'. At first the pub's landlords, Rachel and Mark Graham, were surprised. But it did not take long for their shock to dissolve to humour. 'If someone had obviously taken the time to look us up, it wouldn't have taken five minutes to say: 'Oh, there's a place called Vogue,'' said Rachel, 49, who is not a reader of the magazine. The letter, dated 1 March, said: 'We are concerned that the name which you are using is going to cause problems because as far as the general public is concerned a connection between your business and ours is likely to be inferred.' The Star Inn has been in the small village of Vogue, near St Day, for hundreds of years, Mark wrote in response - in which his answer to the request was a 'categorical no'. The magazine's letter was 'hilariously funny', he wrote. He believes it was sent in confusion after the couple changed their trading status to a limited company. He added: 'I presume that at the time when you chose the name Vogue in the capitalised version you didn't seek permission from the villagers of the real Vogue. I also presume that Madonna did not seek your permission to use the word Vogue (again the capitalised version) for her 1990s song of the same name.' The couple, who have run the pub for 17 years, replied to the letter within the seven-day timeframe demanded of them but are yet to receive a response. 'We're just a village community pub,' Rachel added in an interview with the Guardian. 'We do what we can to support the community.' The pub, nicknamed 'the Vogue' by locals, is adorned with maps of the local area circa 1800, and has remained largely unchanged - aside from a few upgrades and additions. Some regulars had been up in arms, Rachel said, and wanted to go to the local council to take the case further. 'We're not really interested in fighting,' she said. 'We're just pointing out the obvious that they should have looked it up themselves. It wouldn't have taken much.' 'Mistakes are made,' she added. 'Some are just a bit funnier than others.' A new letter was sent to the owners on Friday afternoon in which a Conde Nast lawyer admitted it was a mix-up. He said: 'You are quite correct to note that further research by our team would have identified that we did not need to send such a letter on this occasion.' The couple bought the pub after going out for a bike ride and finding it closed for the afternoon. They were disappointed to not be able to stop and have a pint. If they had the pub, they thought at the time, it would have been open. Not long after, an ad popped up in the local paper and they bought it.", "680bcafd69b95833ec86825be9ae80c34330fd7f461b3ff4bd87291b": "The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has cast doubt on Finnish and Swedish membership of Nato, saying he does not have a positive opinion of the two Nordic nations joining the military alliance after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. His remarks came as a Swedish parliamentary security review said membership would reduce the risk of conflict in northern Europe and a day after neighbouring Finland said it aimed to join the alliance. Finland and Sweden, while both Nato partners, have long viewed membership as an unnecessary provocation of Russia, their powerful eastern neighbour. Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, however, has led to a radical rethink of their security policies. Membership of Nato would require ratification by all existing members, and Erdogan remarked to journalists after leaving Friday prayers in Istanbul that Turkey would not welcome either. 'We are currently following developments regarding Sweden and Finland, but we don't feel positively about this,' he said. Turkey has been a Nato member since 1952 and its membership remains a cornerstone of its foreign policy towards western countries. The comments appeared directed at the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation, although they appeared to encompass the communities of Kurdish origin in Scandinavia as a whole. 'We don't want to commit a mistake,' he added. 'Scandinavian countries are like guesthouses for terrorist organisations. To go even further, they have seats in their parliaments, too.' Sweden has a large Kurdish diaspora, and prominent Swedish citizens of Kurdish origin currently include six members of parliament. The Turkish authorities have not provided any evidence for claims that the parliamentarians have links with the PKK or similar groups outside Sweden. The Kurdish-speaking population of Finland was estimated at just over 15,000 people as of 2020, less than 0.3% of the population. Finland's foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, on Friday urged patience and called for a gradual approach in response to Turkey. 'We need some patience in this type of process, it's not happening in one day ... Let's take issues step by step,' he told reporters. Finland's prime minister, Sanna Marin, and president, Sauli Niinisto, on Thursday said the country 'must apply for Nato membership without delay'. Government confirmation of the decision is expected on Sunday, with parliamentary assent likely early next week. Sweden's ruling Social Democrats will also decide whether to formally approve joining Nato on Sunday and are widely expected to drop decades of opposition to membership. Parliament will debate security issues on Monday. The security review published on Friday did not make a recommendation, but said developing defence alliances outside existing structures was not realistic. 'Swedish Nato membership would raise the threshold for military conflicts and thus have a conflict-preventing effect in northern Europe,' said the country's foreign minister, Ann Linde, presenting the report's conclusions. 'The most important consequence of Swedish membership would be that Sweden would be a part of Nato's collective security and included in security guarantees according to article 5 [of the alliance's founding treaty],' she said. Article 5, the cornerstone of the US-led defensive alliance, states that an attack on one Nato member is an attack on all and commits its current 30 members to defend each other in the event of armed aggression. The Swedish report, due to be debated in parliament on Monday, noted that 'within the framework of current cooperation, there is no guarantee that Sweden would be helped if it were the target of a serious threat or attack'. The Expressen daily has reported that a special cabinet meeting will be called after Monday's parliamentary debate, with the prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, likely to send Sweden's membership application to Nato by the end of the day. Not all the ruling Social Democrats' party members are automatically in favour. 'I think everybody would have wanted more time for this, because it's a huge issue,' Stefan Lofven, the prime minister from 2014 to 2021, told Agence France-Presse. Moscow has previously warned that Finnish and Swedish Nato membership would force it to 'restore balance' by strengthening its defences in the Baltic, including by deploying nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad, between Poland and Lithuania.  Linde noted that Finnish and Swedish Nato membership would be considered 'negative' by Russia. She said neither country expected a 'conventional military attack' in reaction but added that 'an armed assault cannot be ruled out'. The Swedish defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, said on Friday: 'If Sweden chooses to seek Nato membership, there is a risk of a reaction from Russia. Let me state that, in such a case, we are prepared to deal with any counter-response.' Public support for Nato membership in Finland, which shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, has more than trebled to about 76% since Russia's onslaught on Ukraine, and has risen to about 60% in Sweden. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said both countries would be 'welcomed with open arms' and that the accession process would be quick, although formal approval by all the alliance's members could take several months.

The child, Arely Naomi Proctor, died last September after family members performed a ceremony at the Iglesia Apostoles y Profetas, a tiny Pentecostal church in San Jose, because they believed she was 'possessed by an evil spirit', court documents show. The local medical examiner's office ruled the death a homicide as a result of asphyxia due to suffocation and smothering. The toddler's grandfather, Rene Trigueros-Hernandez, and uncle, Rene Hernandez-Santos, were arrested this week on charges of child abuse leading to the death of the victim, the San Jose police department said in a statement. The girl's mother, Claudia Hernandez-Santos, was arrested in January and charged with assault on a child resulting in death. It was not immediately known if the girl's grandfather and uncle have an attorney who can speak on their behalf. The Santa Clara public defender's office, which is representing Claudia Henandez-Santos, did not immediately return a message Friday from the Associated Press. According to court records, Claudia Hernandez-Santos told police she believed her daughter was possessed because she would 'wake up and scream or cry periodically'. She and her brother brought the child to the church on 24 September 2021 in the early morning to perform an exorcism. Claudia Hernandez-Santos told police she attempted to stick her finger down her daughter's throat to induce vomiting and that the child 'fell asleep several times' while she pushed down on her throat with her hand, court documents show. The child's mother is accused of depriving the girl of food and of holding her neck and squeezing it while the grandfather and uncle held the child down. The force on the girl's throat appeared to leave multiple bruises. Claudia Hernandez-Santos told police that the family waited two hours before calling police after the child became unresponsive. The grandfather told the Mercury News last week that he had performed the ceremony on the child to 'liberate her of her evil spirits'. 'If you read the Bible, you'll see that Jesus casts away demons and made sick people healthy again,' he told the newspaper. 'It's not when I want to do it, it's when God, in his will, wants to heal the person. The preacher is like an instrument of God; what we do is what God says.' Santiago Garcia, the owner of the home where the church operates, told the Mercury News that he was outside the house while the exorcism was being performed and did not know what was going on until the police arrived. 'The grandpa told me they were praying and they think that by praying, the Holy Ghost will come and save her ... The mom said she was trying to squeeze her body to bring her demons out,' said Garcia. 'It's very awful. Very, very awful.' According to various members of churches that are associated with the San Jose church, it is considered an outlier due to differences in doctrines and practices. Speaking to the Mercury News, Pastor Rafael Escobar, who heads a sister church in the area, described the incident as 'shocking' and sought to distance his organization from it. 'Church rooted in God has nothing to do with exorcisms at all, you can't mix that stuff with God ... Those are Satanic things,' Escobar told the Mercury News. 'It's not common at all in our church and we don't practice it ... it really shocks me a lot.'

Every weekend he and his friends would go into Nottingham city centre to start a ruck. One night in the summer of 2011, the 19-year-old threw a single punch. He immediately sensed it was different. There was no resistance, and the victim swayed back. 'I knew something bad had happened as soon as I hit him,' he says today. Dunne didn't hang around. Without a word to his friends, he fled the scene. A month passed and he began to forget about the incident. If something terrible had happened, he would have heard. But then friends who were out with him that night got in touch. They had been questioned about it. It was inevitable his turn would come. In fact, the finger was already being pointed at him. He discovered that one of his friends had given the police his name. One day, the police arrived at his mother's house. He was out, so they called him and told him to hand himself in for questioning; nothing serious. When he turned up at the police station, he was arrested on suspicion of murder. Dunne discovered that 28-year-old trainee paramedic James Hodgkinson, the man he had hit, had died after spending nine days in a coma. Dunne was jailed for manslaughter. Because he admitted to his crime and there were mitigating factors (despite his predilection for fighting, he had no criminal record, no weapon was used, and James's bleed to the brain resulted from his fall rather than Dunne's single punch to the jaw), he was only sentenced to 30 months in jail, of which he served 14. At the time, Dunne thought he was unlucky. All he had done was throw a random punch on a night out scrapping with his mates. Others thought he was obscenely lucky. Some, including Hodgkinson's parents, suggested he should have received a far longer sentence. Ten years on, he has written a book about the punch, and how it changed his life and the lives of others. Right from Wrong is part mea culpa, part love letter to his mother, and part manifesto on how to help children from difficult backgrounds to avoid the lifestyle he led. At its heart is the theme of restorative justice. Dunne has been able to rebuild his life largely thanks to Hodgkinson's parents, Joan Scourfield and David Hodgkinson, who wrote to him and eventually met him in an attempt to understand the incomprehensible - why a stranger ran out of nowhere to throw the punch at their beloved son that killed him. It resulted in an extraordinary and complex relationship. When he threw the punch, Dunne had no qualifications and sold drugs to make a living. Today, he has two young children, a first-class degree in criminology, and talks in schools, universities and prisons about conflict resolution and restorative justice. We meet at his home in Nottingham. Dunne, now 30, is preparing his children for bed. Peppa Pig is muted on the TV while he reads to the kids. There are fancy-dress outfits on a clothes rail, toys galore and a children's library. It's an image of chaotic domestic bliss. Dunne carries the children upstairs, one in each arm, and returns a few minutes later. He puts the kettle on, and asks if we can go into the garden so he can smoke a cigarette. He is a warm, quietly spoken man. He appears relaxed, taking everything in his stride, but it doesn't take long to discover the intensity bubbling underneath. How is he feeling about the book? 'I'm excited and anxious,' he says. Why is he so anxious? 'Because I'm so honest in it.' It's true. Nothing is sugar-coated. We hear of his admirable achievements, but he also shows us an unattractive side, when he considered himself almost as much a victim as Hodgkinson was, and was determined to exact revenge on the former friend who he refers to as 'the snitch'. When Joan and David initially asked him to explain why he had punched James, he couldn't give a satisfactory answer. All he could say was that he had received a call telling him that things were kicking off, and he ran over to support his friends. It made no sense to Joan and David. So he started to think about his past, about what had made him into that young man. And this is what we are now talking about, sitting at the bottom of his garden on a cold spring evening. Dunne grew up on the Meadows in Nottingham, an infamous estate blighted by drugs, violence and criminality. By the time he was seven and his younger brother, Sam, was 18 months old, his parents had split up. His mother, a functioning alcoholic who worked as a registered childminder, did her best to bring them up. Young Jacob found it difficult to focus, but he got through his early school days easily enough. At secondary school, that changed. He befriended troubled kids from the Meadows, many of whom came from criminal or dysfunctional families. He couldn't settle, acted the class fool, told teachers he wasn't interested. He was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and told he was on the autistic spectrum. At 14, he was permanently excluded from his school, which said it could no longer support his education. He had never been violent, just a nuisance. Out of school, he had time to discover drink and drugs. He wasn't tough, but he soon learned how to fight. 'I felt a failure because I had failed in school, but I masked that with the bravado of being a lad's lad. As I became more exposed to people who were hard, I became harder.' Did they make him prove himself? 'Yes. They'd start a fight and expect you to join in. If you didn't, it would be like, 'What the fuck? Why didn't you back me up?' Or they'd say, 'You're not really about this life, are you?' and give you an ultimatum. It was all about being tough; earning respect through intimidation.' He had been a keen athlete - the best hurdler in school, a decent basketball player and a competitive footballer. But after being kicked out he gave up on sport and the opportunity to be mentored by positive role models. His mother managed to get him into the local church school just before his GCSEs. But having missed 18 months of school, he didn't stand a chance. 'I didn't turn up to do my GCSEs. I was, like, I know I'm going to fail and feel even more shit about myself.' With no qualifications, there were few career options available to him. And he didn't much fancy a regular nine-to-five job. So by 16 he was selling drugs. Was he a good dealer? 'Not really.' Did he make decent money? 'Not really. The only thing that makes you a massive amount of money is crack and heroin, and I wouldn't sell that because I would have had to have had it in my mum's house and she was a childminder.' He wanted to protect his mother, whom he adored, which makes what happened later even more painful. 'I could sell an ounce of weed and make PS100. I sold cocaine, but more so I could use it for free.' At weekends, he and his friends would drink alcohol and snort cocaine. By the evening, they were sufficiently fuelled for a fight in town. Why did he get such a buzz from scrapping? 'It was the adrenaline, and the sense of belonging. As you develop those friendships and values, the roots of those values go deeper and you struggle to see anything else.' Had he hurt anybody seriously before Hodgkinson? 'Not seriously. Usually it was large groups fighting. You might fall and get kicked by 20 people, or stamped on. It was like a melee a lot of the time.' There was something cartoonish about the violence, he says. However hard people were punched or kicked, they always seemed to get up and walk away. Eventually the leaders started to carry knives. Was he one of them? 'No, I was never a hardcore member, and I never wanted to kill anybody.' Did those who carried knives want to kill people? He thinks about it. 'No, I don't think they did. I think it was more bravado.' I ask if he ever got badly hurt. 'I got bottled a few times and was unconscious on the floor. I used to have a shaven head, so you'd see a few scars in the hairline.' Did he get an adrenaline rush when he was getting battered? 'Yes, the scars were all badges of honour. Another story to tell to your group.' By the time of the incident, he says, he no longer believed that violence had consequences. It was all just a brutal game. 'We were oblivious to the fact that the stuff we were engaged in could seriously harm somebody. We had become desensitised to violence from a young age, particularly once we started drinking alcohol. Nothing really bad happened, especially because for a long time nobody carried knives, so the violence became normalised.' Saturday 30 July 2011 had been a gorgeous sunny day. Dunne and his mates were celebrating a friend's 18th birthday and they started early with a few lines of cocaine. One of the older boys was flush with cash and took them to a bar where they drank champagne in the afternoon. They went from pub to pub, drinking and snorting all day long. One of his friends popped half an ecstasy pill into his drink to add to the mix. As the evening wore on he became separated from his friends, but continued drinking. At about 1am he got a call saying things were kicking off on Old Market Square, a couple of streets away. By now Dunne was steaming for action. Meanwhile, James Hodgkinson had enjoyed a boozy Saturday at Trent Bridge with his father and brother watching England play India in the cricket Test. The three had drunk steadily through the day and gone on a mini pub crawl in the evening. They were at their final stop, exhausted but happy and peaceful. James's brother's sunglasses had been taken by a friend of Dunne's. James had gone outside to ask for them back, and Dunne's friends didn't take it well - they were spoiling for a fight. That's when Dunne received the call asking for help. He ran over to the pub, saw his friend butting heads with James, fist clenched ready to punch. Dunne's friend's girlfriend pulled him away. That was when Dunne ran in and threw his fatal punch. After Dunne ran away and James fell to the ground, David Hodgkinson, James's father, gave chase, but Dunne escaped. James was unconscious for 15 minutes, then sick five times in the ambulance. In A&E, they didn't treat his head injury initially, saying he had drunk too much alcohol and should sober up overnight. The next morning, the hospital rang and said there had been a bleed on the brain and James needed surgery. When David arrived, James was unconscious. His last words to his son were: 'You'll be all right, it's going to be fine.' After nine days in a coma, the family were told his brain, heart and lungs were failing. They agreed to turn off life support. Two years ago, Dunne made a moving BBC podcast series called The Punch. In it, he talked to James's parents about how they had managed to build a relationship. 'If I'd got hold of you in those early days, I would have tried to kill you, no doubt about it,' David Hodgkinson told Dunne in the podcast. 'The anger and rage inside me were terrible.' Dunne admits he was also raging at that time. But he was more bothered about the friend who had ratted on him than the fact that he had killed a man. He was thinking about revenge. His lawyers had provided him with the statement his friend had made to the police implicating him. Dunne showed it to gang leaders and friends in the hope they would exact revenge on his behalf. His actions could have resulted in another tragedy. What were you thinking about, I ask. He shrugs. 'It's all centred around ego and pride. It's just awful. Now I spend my time in schools trying to dispel all the contradictions that gang culture and that perspective on life has because none of it makes any sense.' Even though it was a ragtag gang, their code was based on the mafia's omerta - ultimately the only thing that mattered was remaining loyal to each other. His mother showed him a different perspective. 'She was worried about James's parents. She was crying for them. She was going, 'I can't believe there's another mum out there who's lost a son.'' How did you react to what she said? 'I was like, 'Fuck, that's the last thing I want to think about, Mum.'' He looks away, ashamed. Dunne was jailed in a young offender institution. He would tell fellow inmates about the snitch, and they would say that as soon as he got out, he needed to get his revenge. 'My prison experience was counterproductive - it made me worse emotionally and mentally.' When he was released, he was homeless and jobless. He sought out the person who had given the police his name, and they agreed to give him PS2,500 as payback. When he describes this in the book, it becomes clear how little he had learned from prison. While he was in jail he discovered Ofsted had stripped his mother of her registered childminder status because he had a conviction for violent crime and had been living with her. As a result, she got behind with her mortgage payments and had to sell her home. 'I felt ashamed, but even then I continued to blame the snitch for what had happened.' It wasn't until he began communicating with Joan and David that he accepted he was to blame rather than the friend he felt had betrayed him. When Dunne was released, his mother was living in rented accommodation. When he went into prison she had been a functioning alcoholic. By the time he was released, she was no longer functioning. A year later, she died. Dunne was heartbroken. Did he feel guilty? 'Yes. I failed her. She believed in me; that I could achieve, and I never lived up to those highs.' He pauses. 'Well, I did when she was gone.' Does he feel she might be alive today if he hadn't killed James? 'I think she would have gone, but maybe later,' he says quietly. After she died, Dunne belatedly developed a sense of responsibility. It was agreed with social services that his brother, Sam, then 15, would move into his one-bedroom flat because he was the person best placed to bring him up. Hodgkinson's parents had been unhappy that Dunne received such a short sentence and unsuccessfully appealed against it. 'I felt James's life was worth more than you served,' Joan told Dunne in The Punch. They felt they had been short-changed by the justice system and that serving 14 months in prison for killing somebody was no deterrent. Their victim support team suggested they consider restorative justice, whereby victim and offender communicate through letters or meet with a mediator in order to help both parties come to a better understanding of what happened and the impact of the crime. (Government research shows that restorative justice provides an 85% victim satisfaction rate and a 14% reduction in reoffending.) They were also told that Dunne had little incentive to engage with it because he had already been released. But he did agree to the process. Why? 'It was a lifeline. I was tormented by the impact it must have had on James's parents. Even though I knew what I was going to hear would be awful, it was the only way I could understand the impact.' He says the first letters he received were 'harsh and brutally honest'. Gradually the tone softened. They told Dunne about what James was like (fair-haired, slender, sporty, smiley and hugely loved) and asked him what he hoped to do with his life. 'It astonished me that they wanted me to make something of myself. It gave me a lot of strength,' he says. Joan told him they had lost one person, there was no point in losing two. Dunne said he hoped to go back into education and get some GCSEs. David and Joan said they would like to meet him in person, but only once he had made a commitment to education. Dunne did GCSEs in English, maths and psychology. He got A* in all three, including 100% in one English paper and 92% and 94% in his psychology papers. They were the highest marks in his college. He then did an access course to get into university without A-levels. Two and a half years after they first wrote to him, Dunne met Hodgkinson's parents on neutral territory. He was terrified, but by then Joan and David realised he was not the young man who refused to make eye contact with them in court; that he had worked hard to rehabilitate himself and had shown huge remorse. 'I told them I wanted to go to university for them. Joan said, 'Don't spend three years of your life doing something you don't want to do, you've got to do it for yourself. Going to university will give you a better career, but it won't make you a better person.'' They have kept in touch and have seen the changes in Dunne as he married, had children, graduated with top honours in criminology, and taught vulnerable children about alternatives to violence. At the end of the podcast, Dunne asked if they could forgive him. Joan said: 'In the beginning I wouldn't have even attempted to try to forgive you. Part of me was, like, if I forgive you, it's like James wasn't worth anything. But working with you, and releasing the bitterness felt about everything else, I think forgiveness has come.' David told him he respected him for turning his life around, that it had taken guts to tell his story and that he knows James would have wanted the outcome they had reached through restorative justice. 'But I can't say, 'Jacob, I forgive you for taking my son from me.'' he said. 'The loss of my son is too great to be able to forgive.' Two years on, their relationship is delicately balanced. Dunne sent them Right from Wrong to get their approval. What did they think? 'They didn't have many comments. They didn't like the fact I'd taken money from the snitch, so we agreed that if any funds are generated from the book, I'll donate that amount to a charity. That was their suggestion.' David and Joan have told Dunne they want to withdraw from the media and try to get on with their own lives. But he is aware the book may cause them renewed pain. Dunne is in an uncomfortable position: he has managed to rebuild his life, while David and Joan grieve. He has been able to present a successful podcast and publish a book because he killed an innocent man. Has he talked to them about how they feel about him profiting from his crime? (He received a PS20,000 advance for the book, though that includes payment for his ghost writer and agent.) 'The thing came up about the snitching, but other than that, no. I would happily give any profit to charity, but I would rather use it to develop my own community projects.' He hopes to show young men alternatives to violence and crime, not just by talking but by doing activities with them. 'I want to get a minibus and take young people from the inner city out hiking. I want to sit down and have grownup chats, and show them what being a responsible male is.' His wife comes home from work and brings us pizza. We eat and chat while the kids sleep upstairs. Dunne talks about his plans. He has been working part-time as a driver for his father-in-law while finishing the book, and now he's exploring how he can use his degree and lived experience to make a difference. In his van on the way back to the station, it emerges that things are not quite as rosy as they appear. Life at home is proving difficult, but he and his wife are trying to make things work. He has depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. He doesn't know where he is heading next career-wise, and is anxious that his book could bind him to his crime rather than help him move on. But he is sure of one thing. He wants to do some good with his life, for the sake of his mother, for Joan and David, and for James. We talk about the 18-year-old Jacob and the anger and self-pity he felt after killing James with that single punch. How does he feel about his younger self now? 'I want to give him a hug because he didn't have a clue what was going on and he didn't have the tools to try to navigate any of that stuff with any likelihood of a positive outcome.' Back then, he felt he had been dealt a terrible hand by fate and the friend that betrayed him. Would he say he was unlucky now? He shakes his head. 'No, I'm lucky. I've got a lot to be grateful for.'   Right from Wrong by Jacob Dunne is published by HarperNorth at PS16.99. To support the Guardian and the Observer, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

The game meat joins other indigenous dishes on the kitchen's menu, such as leafy salads topped with striped red corn and blue corn mush sweetened with berries and maple. Chef Crystal Wahpepah, the owner of Wahpepah's Kitchen and a member of the Kickapoo tribe, is proud to see the gathering. Food is medicine in the Native American tradition, and her Oakland restaurant is all about bringing together Indigenous producers and ingredients - sustainable meats, fresh berries, heirloom corn and herbs - to help people heal. 'Being a Native American chef is more than being a chef. It's deeper than that,' says Wahpepah. 'It's about how you connect to the community and health. It's about how we impact people and what we put in our foods.' In the seven months since she opened Wahpepah's Kitchen, one of only a handful of Indigenous restaurants in the nation, Wahpepah has become the toast of the culinary world. She's speaking at national conferences, preparing for a Food Sovereignty Symposium and Festival in Michigan, and is a finalist for the 2022 Emerging Chef award from the James Beard Foundation. But for all the buzz, Wahpepah's overnight success has been a lifetime in the making. Wahpepah, 50, grew up in Oakland's close knit Native American community. She's registered with the Kickapoo tribe of Oklahoma, like her mother and grandfather. When her parents split, her father, who was Black, went back to Louisiana. She says it was hard being the only mixed-race kid in the family, the only one without a father in her life. But food traditions anchored her to her family and Native American heritage. 'I ended up embracing it,' she says. Wahpepah, a graduate of San Francisco's La Cocina food incubator program, launched a catering business 12 years ago specialising in Native American foods such as salmon, acorns, berries, and her grandmother's Kickapoo bison chili. During the pandemic, when her rented catering kitchen closed, fellow Bay Area chef Reem Assil invited Wahpepah to take over her former restaurant space just under the Fruitvale BART station. Today, Wahpepah's Kitchen is a bustling hub filled with bright colors and artwork that tells the story of the food they serve. A mural by the artist Votan Henriquezan depicts Indigenous food warriors from across the Americas, while columns painted by Dine artist Tony Abeyta are adorned with golden corn - Navajo symbols of fertility and sustenance - set against turquoise and cobalt blue clouds. Working alongside her three daughters, Rosario, Rikki and Kala Hopper, who are registered Big Valley Pomo, her sous chef Josh Hoyt (Ojibwe) and Ecuadorian head chef Diego Cruz, Wahpepah's mission is to introduce people to real Indigenous cuisine while making sure her family traditions endure. Take the elderberries and blackberries she loves to cook with, for instance. 'I find berries the most beautiful thing. It's memories of me growing up and picking blackberries with my grandfather,' she says. 'Those are the best times and actually one of the healing times for me. I believe life is a circle in how it all comes back; and if it did it for me it can do it for somebody else.' The Guardian sat down with Wahpepah to discuss how her upbringing and heritage shaped her cuisine, her passion for food sovereignty, and healing her community through food. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Your food feels like what you'd be eating if you had a garden and were able to forage for seasonal food. How would you describe your cooking philosophy and approach to recipes? That's exactly what we like to represent when you eat [our food]. If we look at how the universe works, we're supposed to eat in a natural way according to the season. I also believe that our food shouldn't travel that far. When you taste our food, you taste the cleanness and that it doesn't travel. That's my philosophy and I'm pretty sure I'm right. Some of our recipes, like the Kickapoo chili, are things that my tribe always makes. I also gather recipes from going to the library and reading Native American stories, and getting recipes from them. It's been overlooked how beautiful Native foods are and where they come from. Our background comes from a lot of protein, so I specialise in game meat, such as venison and rabbit. My grandfather was a hunter, so when my brother hunts, he knows to bring it to me and I know how to cut it. How would you describe your mission as a chef, and what do you enjoy most about your job? Our food system is really pretty bad. It affects who we are, our energy, how you think. It has a lot to do with depression. My mission is to have awareness of our food, and at the same time make it visible to our community, using indigenous knowledge and expertise to transform the food system. And also to cultivate and sustain connections to Indigenous farmers. The most beautiful thing about being a Native American chef is the community and who you get to work with ... In my early days as a caterer, sometimes I only got one catering job a month. I went to a lot of food sovereignty summits and catered for a lot of Native American organisations. Those are the people that made Wahpepah's Kitchen. I wouldn't do what I do without my community, here in Oakland but also all over the nation. And being supportive and actually being with Native-led people, and making a difference in every child and every elders' life. Everyone can make a difference in our food system. You use ingredients like amaranth, purple corn and Oklahoma red hominy. Where do you find them? I've been very fortunate to work with Native American food producers. We have smoked cedar salt done for us by Sakari Farms in Oregon. The maple sugar comes from Michigan. Blue corn is from the Ute Nation in Colorado. The chocolate is from Belize. Wild peppermint from South Dakota, smoked salmon from the Lummi Nation in Seattle. A member of the Mono Nation in Fresno mills acorn flour and delivers it every two weeks. When somebody comes to see me from another state, they bring corn or wild rice. Deep Medicine Circle [a non-profit farm and Indigenous food collective] growing our greens. Everything you see on the menu is from a Native American or Indigenous producer. Anyone who comes into my life and can offer some positivity ... I know that will transfer to us and the people who eat our food. How have you designed your menu for healing? We come from a gluten-free diet. When people ask what is gluten free [on the menu], I say everything, with the exception of the blue corn bread. If you want to indulge, indulge right, and the blue corn has a lot of good iron. And I like to offer a lot of teas, different berry teas and mint teas. You have wild mint, peppermint and yerba buena. Teas are healing, they're comforting. Who taught you to cook, and what are your earliest food memories? My grandma Cecilia. My grandparents come from Oklahoma, and I used to go back and forth there from Oakland during the summer. I come from a family that cooks, and was always fascinated being in the kitchen with my grandmother and my aunt. I would always ask my grandmother, 'Where did you learn this?', and she was always telling me. One of the first things I made was dried corn. My aunt had a farm, pigs and the whole shebang. I was seven, and we would get the corn during harvest, cut the corn, and put it on window screens. That's how you would dry it in Oklahoma, because it's so hot, and it would dry for three or four days, and then we would have it for soups. That was one of the first things I ever made and and one of the things I pretty much always copy from there. Growing up in the Midwest, we did a unit on local Native American nations, but it probably was not at all accurate. Do people have a lot of misconceptions about Native American foods? We haven't talked about fry bread - a lot of people think that's what [all Native Americans] made. It's not true. And I always knew that, just because of the different foods we had. [Fry bread] is more like pow wow food. It was something that was given to Native Americans on the reservation when they first moved onto them, probably in the 1800s. To this day we eat it when I go back to Oklahoma, but I eat it as a celebration, not as an everyday meal. There's a lot of discussion today about food sovereignty with people of color, especially African Americans, but this was an issue first for Native Americans. What did being taken from your land and traditional ways of eating do to people's health? It was pretty much [devastating] healthwise. Can you imagine being removed from your homeland? I can only go from my own experience, but my family has been affected with diabetes and lost their limbs, heart disease, cancer and things like that. Me and my sister were a year apart. And she died from cancer, leaving behind seven kids. It makes you think, if we just ate better, could we have done more to avoid this? It makes me want to work harder.", "d78add769e006c18c46407d404611a1616e5eb9e2bfa48336f088d0e": "", "446b82258b64908f500f1434f92bf915a4f0f81157311268282305c3": "", "aa88cd418b02ed6b7c5fbe20b0f662dd91328fc97e3706292f47213c": "", "fcc6a79797f1b72d98e6ba0b8a4d2babb1e122f37f5012efa6db14a1": "", "882178cdc6cc5895bbe307385ec5a192930be49b5f464af6fc80a842": "", "e98679e23fb2c61f0fb2879425e1d01b4533e93eee08b34d09485d70": "", "587f2f87c5be171aca13ebbfda9272132e1c0b593d82db92543aed2c": "", "58b87348039c1cf688399fb6223c237f3b4a0dad446c3eb2cafb59b1": "", "e2d4159481bc72d22f135604cf120e73619ff85e86ffbe1693c8d9d3": "", "cf1bb0d31cb77cd127afb107a3e3a138b5b7aa2d1f60cbf8a2d7cd2e": "", "3a983c6205f98e2a148d16ea4eedf3d5f96ae2593ef3e226b6c3689c": "", "c4b817a00104f439a463bcaa29d87fb9ab57e5bf06e84adb749e2d04": "", "c6f97849417cd2fb9c733249159f68473de18d71c79221fd6ffa8906": "", "23a0d72527992f3faf2b178393f74d2b9a10b3252faf0d9850e41a97": "", "13cb6097eaed62a976dd3c4fd44b25cb31bdeb4c63088267637ecfe5": "", "e0aa48a033c7c5f8ccbc22ddff7ae5f440434ac4f7e300b647d873d9": "", "e06db1813ec6398772b50246436177aa4013fa3a2a1a9e294e0a3f6e": "", "bdf2937779e8667868fa3240359b11bc416445cadfcba1bd7ff25357": "", "37dda19998526b17bbce2ff941a69938d94d87477d28cbe17324aabb": "Finland and Sweden could apply for membership of the 30-nation Nato alliance within days, ending decades of military non-alignment in a historic shift triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Here is a brief look at the background and implications of their decisions. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is a defensive military alliance formed in 1949 by 12 countries including the US, UK and France to counter the threat of postwar Soviet Russian expansion in Europe. Its common security guarantee is based on article 5 of the treaty, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all and commits members to defend each other in the event of armed aggression.  Both considered that joining the alliance would represent an unnecessary provocation of Moscow, and so have long pursued policies of neutrality, and then non-alignment, to avoid antagonising a major regional power. Finland's concerns have been largely practical: it shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, declared independence in 1917 after more than a century of rule by Moscow, and its army twice fought off Soviet forces during the second world war before ceding about 10% of its territory. A 1948 agreement of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with Russia isolated Finland militarily from western Europe, though the breakup of the Soviet Union and EU membership have since allowed it to step out of Russia's shadow. Sweden's opposition to Nato membership has been more ideological. Its postwar foreign policy has focused on multilateral dialogue and nuclear disarmament and it has long seen itself as a mediator on the international stage, running down its military after the end of the cold war. It has reintroduced conscription and boosted defence spending since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but many on the Swedish left remain suspicious of the US-led Nato's agenda and argue that Nato membership will only increase regional tensions. Finland's prime minister, Sanna Marin, and her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said last month that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had 'changed Europe's whole security landscape' and 'dramatically shaped mindsets' in the Nordic region. Essentially, many Finns and Swedes increasingly feel that joining Nato will help keep them safe when they face a plainly belligerent and unpredictable Russian leader. Polls show public support for Nato membership has trebled to about 75% in Finland and surged to about 60% in Sweden. Nato membership would mean that for the first time Finland and Sweden would have security guarantees from nuclear states. Both countries switched from formal neutrality to military non-alignment in 1995 when they joined the EU. They are already Nato partners, taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence with the alliance. Finland already meets Nato's defence spending target of 2% of GDP, while Sweden is on course to do so. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said they would be welcomed 'with open arms' if they do apply and that the accession process would be quick, although formal ratification by all the alliance's members could take several months. From the military perspective, the addition of Finland's and Sweden's armed forces would represent a major boost to Nato's assets in northern Europe, filling a hole in the alliance's defences by doubling the length of its border with Russia and improving security and stability in the Baltic region. Russia has repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the 'serious military and political consequences' of such a move would oblige it to take 'retaliatory steps' to 'restore military balance' by strengthening its defences in the Baltic, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Vladimir Putin sees Nato not as a defensive alliance but as a threat to Russia's security. He blames Nato for blocking his takeover of Ukraine and has demanded Nato troops be withdrawn from eastern Europe. It is unclear how he would respond if he considers the alliance's expansion in northern Europe an existential danger. Finland's president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make a formal decision on submitting an application. A positive decision would then be presented to parliament for approval early next week. Sweden's ruling Social Democrats have been split on the issue and are holding an internal consultation, with a decision also due on Sunday. The party is widely expected to back membership, giving an overwhelming majority of MPs in favour. Swedish media have said a final government decision will be made on Monday, with a formal application for membership to be submitted shortly afterwards. Many analysts believe the two countries will apply simultaneously.", "78f6b7896467ea006bb1358c1a16b1e4f47a575a8f5232295223c88f": "There's an acrid smell in the air and an unsettling crunch underfoot as we step over the metallic black and gold detritus of war. Ahead of us, framed by tree branches amputated by tank shells and mortar fire, the sky is reflecting brilliantly on the shimmering flood waters. After negotiating more than a dozen army checkpoints within the thick forests of Kyiv's outer boundary, we have reached the flooded village of Demydiv on the Irpin River and the long-lost wetland basin, which has returned after the dam was opened by Ukrainian troops defending the capital from Russian army units, and was later struck by a missile. The breaching of the Irpin dam at the end of February held back the Russian soldiers and tanks, and reflooded 13,000 hectares (32,000 acres) of wetlands that were drained by the Soviets in the 1960s. Until the outbreak of war, the floodplain was due to be become the foundations of a massive new housing development. But with the waters possibly back for good, the future of the fragile ecology - and that of local communities - is uncertain. Local ecologist Volodymyr Boreyko is calling for the Irpin River to be given the title of 'Hero River', and for Ukraine to follow the precedent set by Ecuador in 2008, when it became the first country in the world to recognise the rights of nature in its constitution. 'I think the Irpin River should be awarded the title of 'Hero River' and be given strong environmental protections, because this year the Irpin, in tandem with the UAF [Ukrainian armed forces] and territorial defence forces, played one of the most important roles in the defence of our capital for the last 1,000 years,' says Boreyko. The large construction projects previously approved for the Irpin floodplain should be cancelled, he adds. The battle for Kyiv wasn't the only time the Irpin has saved the city and, without it, he says, Kyiv would be left vulnerable to attack in the future. 'A thousand years ago, in the days of Kyivan Rus, the Irpin River repeatedly protected Kyiv from the north and north-west from the attacks of the Polovtsians and Pechenegs. It is 162km (101 miles) long, and its floodplain is so wide and swampy, enemy cavalry could not pass. 'If Putin had attacked in a year or two from now, the river Irpin would not have been able to defend the capital because its entire floodplain would have been cemented over and the river itself would be hidden in a collector and be no obstacle whatsoever to enemy tanks.' Before Soviet occupation, says Bohdan Prots of the National Museum of Natural History and CEO of the Danube-Carpathian Programme, the Irpin floodplain was a biodiversity hotspot, a kind of Ukrainian Amazon, with vast wetlands composed of bogs, swamps and marshes that thrived along riverbanks of thick reed beds and dunes of golden sand. 'It was 5 metres deep in places, and full of giant catfish and sturgeon, as well as now-missing wetland bird species and birds of prey, like the white-tailed eagle.' According to Prots, Soviet dams on the Irpin and Dnipro had a catastrophic impact on the ecosystems of the Irpin and its many tributaries that once thrived here. Many housing developments were built on the old floodplain, putting further pressure on the dying river ecosystem. 'Wetlands can't be restored just like that,' says Prots. 'They [the Soviets] created huge environmental problems by damming and adding locks to the Irpin, which over the years steadily reduced the volume and flow velocity of water, which encouraged excessive algae that in turn reduced water oxygenation to the point where big fish could no longer breathe. 'Just because the water has returned it doesn't mean we are looking at a new wetland rich in biodiversity. The ecology has been very badly degraded over many, many years. It would need many years for ecological improvements to be observed,' he adds. The sudden re-flooding of the old Kyiv-Irpin wetlands, which was also used as a first defence by Ukrainians defending Kyiv against the Germans in 1941, is very unlikely to have the kind of ecological benefits a carefully managed rewilding project would produce, he says. 'War doesn't do rewilding - there was no research, there was no planning or mitigation. It might have helped us defend our capital, but before long there will be pressure to redrain this area. Can you imagine how many trillions of mosquitoes will be here this summer?' Prots says he thinks the local government will come under pressure to rebuild the Irpin dam. But while the war is still raging and the Kyiv region still littered with mines, it could be some time before any attempt could begin. 'I think there's a good chance it [the dam] will be rebuilt eventually, but right now all our energies and thoughts are on defeating the invaders, because this is an existential issue for us. Until it is resolved and the Russians are kicked out of our lands, we can't properly address this issue.' Alexey Vasilyuk, biologist and founder and chairman of the Ukrainian Nature Conservation Group (UNCG), says he is hopeful the reflooded Irpin wetlands will remain. 'First of all, these waters are now serving in the defence of Kyiv, so until we are sure Russia won't try to seize Kyiv again, I don't see how we can justify completely draining this area again. Secondly, I think it will be extremely difficult or maybe impossible to reverse what has happened. 'Hypothetically speaking, it might become a very good spawning ground for fish that have dramatically declined here over the last decades, and also become an important breeding ground for many species of rare wetland birds,' he says. But, says Vasilyuk, the return of the water could pose as many problems as opportunities. 'The local ecosystem of the Irpin River basin was in a bad way before the dam burst,' he says. 'And now, a lot of Russian tanks and military equipment are underwater here. The mixing of chemicals and oils from fuel tanks with pollution from inundated landfills is a big threat,' he says. 'Right before the war, many parts of the land were sprayed with pesticides and fertilisers, so there are many threats for humans and wildlife that should be resolved.' Despite the hazards and dangers, Vasilyuk remains optimistic that solutions can be found, and that Kyiv's ancient wetlands may be back for good. 'While the soldiers of the Ukrainian armed forces are fighting to stop the genocide of the Ukrainian people, we think that the environmental front should take care to prevent ecocide,' says Vasilyuk. 'This is possibly the most precious and important wetland in Ukraine, not because of its fragile or unique biodiversity, but because without this swampy barrier, the battle for Kyiv might have had a very different outcome.'

They became war correspondents overnight. Ukrainian journalists were spotlighted this week when the Pulitzer prize board awarded them with a special citation, hailing the country's reporters for the 'courage, endurance and commitment to truthful reporting' they have shown since the Russian invasion. But initially, writing stories and making television reports was secondary for the reporters, editors, and producers who heard explosions around them and scrambled for safety. For more than a month many Ukrainian journalists focused on survival. Some have since returned to work, but often they lack protective equipment and hostile environment training. 'Lots of journalists left Kyiv,' said Kristina Berdynskykh, a journalist at one of Ukraine's major independent publications, Novoye Vremya. 'They weren't thinking about whether they'd be fired, they were just thinking that they had to get their families out.' After the first few days almost all of the staff of Ukraine's prominent newsrooms fled westwards to Lviv where many remain. Lviv quickly became the new temporary capital when Russian forces surrounded Kyiv. 'From the print journalists I know, there was maybe a handful left in Kyiv,' said Berdynskykh. 'It is mostly the TV stations who had small teams of war correspondents who had experience in the Donbas. For everyone else, the situation was an absolute shock.' Those who stayed in Ukraine's hotspots embarked on new careers. Berdynskykh spent 18 nights sleeping on the floor in Kyiv's metro to avoid the shelling and conducted phone interviews. Without a car or taxis, and with shells flying into the city, in-person interviews were near to impossible for the first month she said. 'At first it was practically just western journalists - war correspondents - doing on-the-ground reporting,' said Berdynskykh, who was a leading political reporter but is now focusing on the experiences of ordinary Ukrainians around the country. 'But I'm grateful to them because we were still adapting.' Original reporting has since returned to Ukraine's news sites but most newsrooms cannot afford to simultaneously provide their staff with protective equipment and pay salaries, said Katerina Sergatskova, who founded 24.02 Fund, whose aim is to raise money to help equip reporters and newsrooms with the necessary equipment. The income from online advertising which many Ukrainian news sites relied on dried up when the economy shut down. The demand for protective equipment from Ukrainian journalists has increased as journalists return to work, said Sergatskova. After a month of searching for suppliers, amid a worldwide shortage of bulletproof vests, the 24.02 Fund has now sourced 150 vests and helmets as well as first aid kits and it is working with other organisations to provide first aid training to journalists. Sergatskova, who is a managing editor of Zaborona, another independent Ukrainian publication, fled Kyiv on the seventh day of the war to evacuate her two small children. 'When we saw a Russian plane being shot down from our [apartment's] window, we decided we had to get out,' said Sergatskova. 'At first, we took the children to Lviv and then rockets started to hit there, so we took them to live with friends in Europe. Now we can work knowing that they're safe.' Others, such as Kirill Gonchar in Ukraine's eastern city of Kharkiv, found themselves even more in the deep end. Gonchar was a creative director of a production company, who shot commercials and promotional videos for newsrooms and businesses before the war. Russian bombs devastated Kharkiv in the first few weeks of the war and the city is still shelled several times a day. When Gonchar realised that Kharkiv's journalists had either left or could not leave their basements, he ventured out into the city's streets under shelling to start filming. He said he was almost the only person working on the ground and was soon sending his footage to the BBC, the Associated Press, CNN and others. 'I just felt I had to act and this was something I could do,' said Gonchar. 'At first I thought I'd make a documentary but then I realised that I just needed to just do news so I could share what was happening.' Gonchar said he started looking for a vest and helmet and writing to people after the first week. But it was only after five weeks of working on the ground that some of his former employers managed to source a vest and helmet for him. Asked how he felt about working without equipment, he said that in some ways he did not know any different. When international journalists started arriving in Kharkiv in late March with full kit, it started to figure more heavily on his mind. 'There were several times when I was almost hit,' he said. 'One of the houses that my friends and I moved into because it had a basement was completely destroyed by a rocket a week after I moved out. 'Those who were in the basement survived,' said Gonchar, whose friends were seriously injured in the attack. 'But I can't say I was scared [to work] because I knew other people had it worse than me.' Since 24 February, at least seven journalists have been killed while working in the field and dozens have been injured, according to Ukraine's Institute of Mass Information, a media development organisation.", "d688f74846d6c36570c8655746afc5fe4214d34a36fe9fa584500ef2": "", "9ab7f8e0e284ca7ed907ae85b78cbce1201c60464e1f96c1ace610f9": "The world's leading energy economist has warned against investing in large new oil and gas developments, which would have little impact on the current energy crisis and soaring fuel prices but spell devastation to the planet. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), was responding to an investigation in the Guardian that revealed fossil fuel companies were planning huge 'carbon bomb' projects that would drive climate catastrophe. He said countries must seek to replace Russian oil and gas in the near term without damaging their long-term prospects. 'I understand some countries may look at new fossil fuels but they should remember it takes many years to start production,' he said. '[Such projects] are not the solution to our urgent energy security needs and they will lock in fossil fuel use.' Revelations by the Guardian show nearly 200 carbon bomb projects are in planning, or have already started pumping, that will each result in at least 1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over their lifetimes, equivalent to about 18 years of current global emissions. Companies pursuing such developments could end up with uneconomic stranded assets, Birol warned. 'If the world is to succeed in moving to net zero, these projects may fail to recover their upfront development costs,' he said in an interview with the Guaridan. Soaring global energy prices have led governments to seek new sources of fossil fuels. 'I do understand why countries are reacting like this,' he said. 'But there is the issue of the time horizon.' Big new exploratory projects for oil, gas and coal would take years to produce any fuel and could lock in high greenhouse gas emissions for decades, Birol warned. 'The most suitable projects are those with short lead times and quick payback periods, such as expanding production from existing fields,' he said. Using existing sources more efficiently would also help reduce emissions, Birol noted. He said governments must also urgently seek to reduce fossil fuel demand, through home insulation, cutting speed limits, making public transport cheap or free and introducing car-free days in cities. 'If we do not have these voluntary measures, I'm afraid that energy rationing may be on the table,' he said. Birol said unlike in previous oil shocks, such as those of the 1970s, the world now had cheap alternatives available in the form of solar and wind power, which had plummeted in price. This should prompt governments and companies to push harder for renewable energy. 'I believe we have the chance to make this a historic turning point to a cleaner and more secure energy system,' he said. 'This is the first time I have seen such momentum behind the change to clean energy. 'The world does not need to choose between solving the energy crisis and climate crisis, we can do both.' The UN secretary general also called for an end to new fossil fuel projects, warning that climate change posed 'an existential threat to us all - to the whole world'. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Antonio Guterres said: 'Main emitters must drastically cut emissions, starting now. This means accelerating the end of our fossil fuel addiction and speeding up the deployment of clean renewable energy.' The IEA advised almost exactly a year ago that no new gas, oil or coal development could take place from this year onwards if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C. That finding caused shockwaves among governments in the run-up to the UN Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, where leaders agreed to bring forward national plans in line with the 1.5C limit. But many countries, and private sector companies, have ignored the advice, as the Guardian's investigation of fossil fuel projects under development has shown. These carbon bombs would in effect eliminate any hope of staying within the 1.5C threshold. Greg Muttitt, an energy expert at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, said: 'Governments and companies often suffer from a form of cognitive dissonance: while recognising the urgency and severity of the climate threat, they still keep developing new oil, gas and coalfields and mines that will worsen the problem. The policy answer is a simple one: when in a hole, you need to stop digging.' Greenpeace said the Guardian's investigation revealed the 'fossil fuel industry's business model remains a blueprint for climate catastrophe'. 'Investment plans by oil and gas firms will blow us past every assessment of what is safe for the climate, and that's shocking,' said the group's senior climate adviser Charlie Kronick. 'But what's truly shocking is that they are not hiding it. These activities are legal and in fact are encouraged by governments around the world, particularly the ones that have the biggest reserves and the most to lose.' Caroline Lucas, an MP for the UK's Green party, said in response to the Guardian's investigation: 'Governments seem intent on sending us towards our own destruction. How many more times must we tell fossil fuel companies to #keepitintheground?' Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: 'The answer to a global fossil fuel crisis cannot be to double down on fossil fuels. Every country must go further to rapidly accelerate the transition to clean energy. 'That's the right response to the climate crisis, but it's also the right response to the cost of living and energy security crises too - with renewables now by far the cheapest and most secure form of energy. 'Governments around the world should be urgently investing in a green energy sprint to shift decisively off destructive, expensive, and volatile fossil fuels for good.'", "689ec9a077e03da6d97eca2aa3553d0af2eadeb3d8ff7cdeab1a539a": "Israeli forces have attacked a funeral procession for a Palestinian American journalist shot dead this week, kicking and hitting people with batons and causing mourners carrying her coffin to lose balance and drop it to the ground. Palestinian flags - which are rarely seen - were openly waved by many of the thousands of people who circumvented roadblocks in occupied East Jerusalem to join the funeral procession on Friday for Al Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Aqleh. Mourners sang the Palestinian national anthem and chanted 'Palestine! Palestine!'. Police said mourners were 'disrupting public order'. Footage showed the coffin on mourners' shoulders outside St Joseph's hospital in East Jerusalem as police rushed in and attacked people. The sound of a stun grenade could be heard and the windows of the hearse were smashed in. Israel forbids public displays of Palestinian flags and often prevents people from hoisting them at rallies and protests in the city. Rima Baqleh, a Palestinian sociologist from Jerusalem who attended the same church as Abu Aqleh, said: 'This is unacceptable to attack her coffin and to disrespect the funeral. Shireen had covered the story of Palestine since she was a girl and she wanted always for Jerusalem to be liberated. I think today Shireen managed to liberate Jerusalem - to carry the Palestinian flag in the hands of thousands of people down the road to her burial.' A senior Palestinian figure, Hanan Ashrawi, tweeted that 'savage \u001dIsraeli 'special forces' viciously attack the funeral procession bearing the coffin' of Abu Aqleh as it left St Joseph's hospital. 'The inhumanity [of] Israel is on full display,' said the former Palestine Liberation Organisation official. The EU said it was appalled by the 'unnecessary' force used by the Israeli police, while the White House described footage of the scene as 'deeply disturbing'.  'EU and likeminded partners attended the funeral of Shireen Abu Akleh in occupied East Jerusalem. Appalled by the violence in the St Joseph hospital compound and the level of unnecessary force exercised by Israeli police throughout the funeral procession,' the EU said in a tweet. Police said they had held talks with Abu Aqleh's family in order to 'enable a respectable funeral'. They added: 'Unfortunately, under the auspices of the funeral and taking cynical advantage of it, hundreds of people began disrupting public order before [the funeral] even began. As the coffin was about to exit the hospital, stones began to be thrown at officers from the hospital's plaza, and the officers were forced to use riot dispersal means.'  They released a video in which an officer outside the hospital grounds is seen addressing the crowd. 'If you don't stop these chants and [Palestinian] nationalistic songs we will have to disperse you using force and we won't let the funeral take place,' the officer says. The police presence was heavy throughout the day, with roadblocks set up on the roads from Palestinian neighbourhoods and entrance denied at some points in the Old City, including to accredited journalists. About 150 police were stationed around St Joseph's hospital, including horse-mounted units. Abu Aqleh's coffin left the hospital grounds by vehicle and arrived at a Jerusalem church inside the Old City for her funeral.  Abu Aqleh's brother Anton remained with her body throughout the day, encouraging others to ensure she was buried peacefully and without delay. He held her coffin as it was carried from the church to the nearby Christian cemetery in Mount Zion, trailed by a press vest laid on an orange stretcher. The crowd of Christian and Muslim Palestinian mourners sang pro-Palestine chants but there was little presence of any political factions. 'It is a sad day not only for me but for all the Palestinian people all over the country. She lived with us through her presence on TV, she was one of our family,' said Aaya Odeh, a 26-year-old lawyer who had travelled from Nazareth, 90 miles from Jerusalem. 'I felt that I am losing my mother, I grew up watching her on TV. The one who killed her should be punished and should be brought to justice. The Israelis are undermining Palestinian people and they have no value for their souls.' Abu Aqleh was shot in the head on Wednesday morning in the West Bank city of Jenin during what her colleagues at the scene said was a burst of Israeli fire on a small group of journalists covering an expected Israeli military raid. The Israeli military said its troops shot back after coming under 'massive fire' in Jenin and that 'there is a possibility, now being looked into, that reporters were hit - possibly by shots fired by Palestinian gunmen'. However, the Israeli military chief, Lt Gen Aviv Kochavi, later appeared to back away from those assertions, saying: 'At this stage we cannot determine by whose fire she was harmed and we regret her death.' Video of the incident showed Abu Aqleh was wearing a helmet and body armour clearly marked 'press'. Ali Samodi, a producer for Al Jazeera who was shot in the back, told the Guardian from his hospital bed that contrary to claims made by Israeli officials, there were no gunmen standing near the journalists when they were targeted.

The comments from the special rapporteur, Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng, come after a leaked supreme court draft opinion showed a majority of the court's conservative justices support overturning the nearly 50-year-old precedent in Roe v Wade. The 1973 decision provided federal protections for abortion rights, and invalidated dozens of state abortion bans. It also became a beacon for the global feminist movement, which over the next five decades helped liberalize abortion laws across dozens of countries, including most recently in Latin America, and enshrine the right to abortion in international human rights law. The right to abortion, 'speaks directly to women and girls, who are often in many societies not seen as people', Mofokeng said in an interview with the Guardian. The right to abortion speaks to who owns women's bodies in society and, 'who fully can decide - and benefit from that bodily autonomy'. If the court were to end protections for abortion, at least 26 US states would be certain or likely to outlaw abortion, forcing women to travel hundreds of miles to the nearest clinic, self-manage abortions with medication and heighten the risk of prosecution, abuse and violence for both women and doctors. 'It sends chills down my spine to think that the court is being brought on to play - as a very powerful player - to decide on an issue of human rights that has jurisprudence, and has a basis in legal findings, that will actually lead to restriction of rights,' said Mofokeng. Mofokeng was the lead expert in an amicus brief to the supreme court, sometimes called a 'friend of the court' brief, in which she urged justices not to reverse US abortion rights on human rights grounds. In both her brief and interview with the Guardian, she said a reversal of Roe v Wade would, 'legitimize the use of morality and theological reasoning' to take away human rights, empower anti-rights activists globally, criminalize the practice of medicine, undermine the doctor-patient relationship and expose healthcare providers and patients to heightened abuse and violence. 'Whether you are in the United States, whether you are in Europe, whether you are in Latin America - it matters not where you are,' Mofokeng said. The rights at issue in the case, 'are human rights, important human rights issues'. 'They deal with human rights principles of dignity, they deal with human rights principles of equality,' and 'important issues of human rights of nondiscrimination'. Considering access to abortion as a human right helps people see, 'why then the overturning would be catastrophic to those very principles of human rights'. 'They are part of the bigger global issue, where you have anti-abortion movements growing but also anti-abortion legislation being implemented more widely across the world,' Mofokeng said. 'The court will give legitimacy to an ever-growing anti-women's rights [movement] in totality,' said Mofokeng. 'People who are anti-women's rights and anti-equality see abortion as a low hanging fruit.' Her comments have been echoed by other international human rights groups such as the International Bar Association (Iba), the foremost association of international attorneys, and by Ipas, a US-based civil society organization that seeks to strengthen abortion rights. The Iba said overturning Roe v Wade would, 'reverse one of the most important precedents in US history', and represent a 'backward step' when countries such as Argentina, Colombia and Mexico are protecting reproductive rights. The president and CEO of Ipas, Anu Kumar, said 'the US already has a tainted reputation on reproductive justice,' and that any reversal of Roe v Wade would energize, 'anti-choice white supremacist organizations' globally. Should Roe v Wade be overturned, the fact that Americans of color, low-income women, sexual minorities and the young will be disproportionately likely to be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, Mofokeng said underscores her concerns. 'Where will people stop? Will the next thing be about putting in jail or criminalizing people who treat drug users with dignity? Where will we draw the line? People who are already in a vulnerable situation should not be further marginalized by a law or political context, in fact it's precisely those people who the law must ensure protection of rights,' she said. Although outlawing abortion across more than half of states may violate UN treaties to which the US is party, including the convention against torture, it is unlikely the UN could hold the US accountable. That is because the US holds a powerful position within the UN, as a founding member. However, even if the UN cannot hold the US accountable directly, it will probably have other impacts on US standing, especially the ability of the US to advocate for the rights of women and girls globally. 'When you then have the US supreme court making judgment that threatens the very human rights of people who are pregnant, when that court legitimizes attacks on healthcare workers, when that court legitimizes austerity and cuts to abortion clinics - you can see then how this is a global problem,' said Mofokeng.", "a6604697be2677de422ea33818191071e2c0e47ea78cb9546ffbdb81": "The Democratic Unionist party has vowed to paralyse the Stormont assembly and block the formation of an executive in a dramatic escalation of its campaign against the Northern Ireland protocol. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, said his party would refuse to nominate a speaker when the assembly meets for its inaugural session on Friday afternoon, a move that will derail the legislature and raise the stakes in a dispute over the protocol between London and Brussels. The party had been expected to block the appointment of a first and deputy first minister in the power-sharing executive but in a statement early on Friday it announced it would also pull the plug on the assembly to further pressure the UK government to take 'decisive action' on the protocol. Sinn Fein, which emerged as the largest party in Stormont after last week's local elections, called the announcement 'shameful'. The move will paralyse Stormont and plunge Northern Ireland into political crisis a week after a historic assembly election in which Sinn Fein overtook the DUP as the biggest party, making Sinn Fein's deputy leader, Michelle O'Neill, the putative first minister. The DUP move is designed to send a signal to Downing Street and the European Union that the party is willing to ratchet up tension in Northern Ireland to secure changes to the protocol, which puts post-Brexit checks on goods entering the region from Great Britain. 'Today the DUP will not support the election of a speaker in the assembly,' Donaldson said in a statement to the Belfast News Letter. 'The protocol is a direct challenge to the principles that have underpinned every agreement reached in Northern Ireland over the last 25 years. It erodes the very foundations that devolution has been built upon.' Donaldson hinted at no swift resolution to the impasse: 'I have both patience and resolve in equal measure to see the Irish Sea border removed, and stable as well as sustainable devolution restored.' The mothballing of Stormont means civil servants and ministers from the outgoing administration, with reduced powers, will run Northern Ireland in what has been termed a 'zombified' state. They cannot make important decisions or launch new initiatives. DUP strategists hope this will embolden Boris Johnson, the prime minister, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, and strengthen their hand in a showdown with the European Commission. They have threatened to unilaterally abandon parts of the protocol but Donaldson said he wanted action, not words. Other parties condemned the DUP. 'Today is the day we should be forming an executive to put money in people's pockets and to start to fix our health service,' said O'Neill. 'The DUP have confirmed they will punish the public and not turn up. They are disgracefully holding the public to ransom for their Brexit mess. Shameful.' On Thursday, the Royal College of Nursing, the British Medical Association Northern Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, and the Royal College of GPs warned that failure to form an executive would endanger patients' lives. 'Our health service is on the verge of collapse,' they said a joint statement. Naomi Long, the Alliance party leader, called the DUP move a disgrace. She said: 'We need the NHS fixed, the cost of living addressed and a budget set. How is this going to help?'", "9985cca40b40ebe281bb69012dd7d65461602d7f247e40d1261a5e5d": "Nearly 150 people have been killed and scores wounded during gunfights between warring gangs in Haiti, as the latest surge of violence has paralysed much of the sprawling capital, Port-au-Prince. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said on Thursday that it had treated more than 96 people with gunshot wounds in its medical facilities in Port-au-Prince since 24 April. 'The number of trauma admissions received per week tripled compared to mid-April, and most of them are very serious gunshot wounds that require extensive care,' said Mumuza Muhindo, MSF head of mission in Haiti, in a statement on Thursday. 'The Haitian population is in an extremely vulnerable situation.' Earlier this week, the National Human Rights Defense Network found that as many as 148 people had been killed during intense battles between the 400 Mawozo and Chen Mechan, two feared rival gangs. During a bloody fortnight of battle, gang members raped women and girls and burned people alive, the organisation said in a report on Tuesday. In one neighbourhood, gangs killed 47 people before burning 17 of the bodies and burying the rest in mass graves. 'A massacre of incredible cruelty was perpetrated,' claims the report, which says that authorities did little to stem the violence. 'At the highest level of the state, there was no reaction.' Many residents fleeing violence have arrived to makeshift shelters, sometimes just a few blocks from their homes, where they face little humanitarian assistance and risk exploitation, according to charities working in the capital. Roadblocks have been thrown up in gang-controlled neighbourhoods across Port-au-Prince, preventing ambulances and aid vehicles from moving around. MSF reported that some patients they saw could only reach a hospital after delays of 24 hours, due to barricades manned by gangs. Analysts say the upsurge in violence is also due to a growing dispute between the 400 Mawozo and G9 gangs, which intensified when the former invaded the latter's territory. 'Occupying more territory would have given them more leverage to negotiate electoral votes and access to more businesses that can be extorted for protection,' said Louis-Henri Mars, founder and executive director of local peace-building organisation Lakou Lape. Haiti, the first black republic, has largely been plagued by violence, political instability and meddling from foreign powers since it bloodily won independence from French colonists two centuries ago. Today the scene is particularly bleak as gangs - often with the tacit support of political and business elites - continue to wage war on each other, the authorities and civilian populations. The country is still feeling the aftershocks of a string of overlapping crises last year. In July, President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in his hillside home. A month later a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti's southern peninsula, killing more than 2,000 people and destroying tens of thousands of homes. A spate of kidnappings - of rich and poor alike - paralysed much of the capital last autumn, while the deportation of over 10,000 Haitians from the United States' southern border to Port-au-Prince added to the instability. But the scenes in the capital, where murder, kidnapping and gun battles are a daily reality, have seldom been so bleak. 'This is the worst violence-related crisis we have ever seen,' said Fiammetta Cappellini, country director for Italian aid group AVSI. 'More and more areas of the capital - usually considered 'safe' - are now battlefields; thousands of people are fleeing their houses.' Violence in the Caribbean country looks unlikely to abate after the extradition of Joly 'Yonyon' Germine, a leader of the 400 Mawozo gang, to the United States on Tuesday. Germine was charged in the US for involvement in the kidnapping of 17 members of an Ohio-based missionary organisation last October. Cappellini added that the international community had for too long ignored Haiti's woes. 'Something has to be done now,' the aid worker, based in Haiti for over a decade, said. 'Before it's too late and the country spirals into hell with no way back.'", "fd29abf04ef154616862740df47ba24c368364a0573ce250f2b5bf1d": "Two people have been diagnosed with monkeypox in London, health officials said. The pair live in the same household and are not linked to the previous confirmed case in England that was announced on 7 May, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said. Of the latest two cases, one person is receiving care at the infectious disease unit at St Mary's hospital, Imperial College healthcare NHS trust in London. The other is isolating and does not currently require hospital treatment, the UKHSA said. Health officials said they were investigating where and how the infections were acquired. People who might have been in close contact with either person were being contacted and given information and health advice, the agency said. Dr Colin Brown, the UKHSA's director of clinical and emerging infections, said: 'We have confirmed two new monkeypox cases in England that are not linked to the case announced on May 7. 'While investigations remain ongoing to determine the source of infection, it is important to emphasise it does not spread easily between people and requires close personal contact with an infected symptomatic person. The overall risk to the general public remains very low. 'We are contacting any potential friends, family or contacts in the community. We are also working with the NHS to reach any healthcare contacts who have had close contact with the cases prior to confirmation of their infection, to assess them as necessary and provide advice.'", "8f42ce1e22e4a7dcc03345581d73d955e2b0927816530f7c615a6bf6": "Elon Musk has said his controversial $44bn (PS36bn) takeover of Twitter is 'temporarily on hold' in a series of early morning tweets that sent the company's stock into a tailspin and cast doubt on whether the deal will be successful. The Tesla chief tweeted on Friday morning that the deal was being frozen while he awaited details supporting Twitter's assertion that fewer than 5% of its users were spam or fake accounts. In a subsequent tweet, Musk said he was 'still committed to acquisition', amid speculation that the world's richest man was about to walk away from the deal or seek a lower price. The announcement left analysts and observers scratching their heads, prompting some to ask if the eccentric billionaire was 'trolling Twitter'. 'What is going on here?' Matt Levine, a Bloomberg opinion columnist, wrote. 'You are not supposed to say things that aren't true and that will affect the stock of a public company that you are trying to buy. That is what is usually called 'securities fraud'.' The move also comes a day after Twitter announced the departure of two top figures at the company in an internal shakeup. The Musk takeover plan has prompted a backlash among both Twitter users and staff. Musk has long been a divisive user of the platform, and has announced seemingly major news about his businesses to his 83 million followers later found to be false. The Securities and Exchange Commission fined him $20m after he tweeted in 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private. A judge recently determined those tweets were inaccurate and reckless. He announced the hold on the Twitter takeover alongside a link to a Reuters article published on 2 May that referred to a filing with the US financial regulator, in which Twitter claimed that false or spam accounts represented fewer than 5% of its 229 million daily average users. The filing does not appear to contain new information on spam accounts, however, with previous quarterly filings going back to 2014 also referring to the 'fewer than 5%' figure, albeit with the caveat that the true number could be higher. The Tesla CEO has been looking for additional investors to support the deal, the Washington Post reported, as Tesla's stock price has weakened. Tesla shares have lost a quarter of their value in the last month, and have fallen from about $1,150 in early April when Musk confirmed he had taken a huge stake in Twitter, to $769.59 Friday. Musk has already secured more than $7bn (PS5.7bn) in outside funding from a group of investors that includes the tech tycoon Larry Ellison, a Saudi prince, the Qatar state investment fund and the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange. Musk's net worth, estimated by Forbes earlier this week at $240 billion, was $232 billion as of Friday. 'We'd always said he may cut or run or change his tune at the 11th hour and 59 minutes and 59 seconds on the clock. It is farcical,' Neil Campling, the head of TMT research at Mirabaud, told Reuters. 'He has never had the full funding. We know that from his constant attempts to get financial support, but he also held all the cards.' Musk has agreed to pay a $1bn break fee to Twitter if he walks away from the deal. The news sent Twitter's shares down nearly 10% to $40.71 when Wall Street closed, on concerns that the deal could collapse. He will probably be legally bound to either follow through with the deal or pay the fee, said Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at National Securities. 'Saying it's temporarily on hold is not standard operating procedure when you've made a tender offer for a company. It's confusing and also nonsensical. It just doesn't hold up,' Hogan told Reuters. The agreed takeover values Twitter at $54.20 per share. However, a renowned US short-selling firm, which takes bets against companies' share prices, said this week that Musk could submit a lower bid for Twitter, owing to a slump in tech stocks and a weak financial performance at the social media platform. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, a US financial services firm, said: 'The implications of this tweet will send this Twitter circus show into a Friday the 13th horror show as now the Street will view this deal as 1) likely falling apart, 2) Musk negotiating for a lower deal price, or 3) Musk simply walking away from the deal with a $1bn breakup fee.' Tesla shares, which are part-funding the takeover via a loan taken out against Musk's shareholding, were up nearly 5% on Friday. Musk has railed against automated or 'bot' Twitter accounts - which are not run by human users - and said after announcing the takeover that he wanted to improve the platform by 'authenticating all humans'.  Twitter allows automated accounts on its platform, ranging from disaster early warning systems to algorithmic art. In 2021, it introduced an 'automated account' label to publicly mark such accounts as being run by a computer, not a human. But those accounts need to follow strict rules and can lose access if they misbehave. One such automated account may even have been the driver for Musk's initial purchase of Twitter stock. Created by a 19-year-old aviation enthusiast, the @elonjet Twitter feed tracks and automatically tweets the location of Elon Musk's private plane, taken from public flight tracker data. In January, Musk offered the teenager $5,000 to buy the account and shut it down, declining the creator's $50,000 counter-offer. A few days later, he began purchasing Twitter stock, filing his legal declaration that he own a substantial stake in early April. But declared automated accounts such as @elonjet are far outnumbered by spam accounts, which deliberately break Twitter's terms of service in pursuit of commercial or political goals. Such accounts may use the reply function or direct messages to send adverts or scams to other users, or they may represent attempts to influence the public discourse by tweeting political propaganda. Other fake accounts exist purely to boost the metrics of individual users, who can buy followers, likes and retweets from 'bot sellers' who control thousands or millions of fake accounts. 'Bots massively multiply the ability of one person to attempt to manipulate people,' Samuel Woolley at Oxford University said after the launch in 2017 of a report into social media manipulation. 'Picture your annoying friend on Facebook, who's always picking political fights. If they had an army of 5,000 bots, that would be a lot worse, right?'

The UAE's ministry of presidential affairs announced a 40-day period of mourning and a three-day suspension of work in all ministries and the private sector beginning on Friday, including flags to be flown at half-staff. He had long ceased having involvement in the day-to-day affairs of ruling the country. Instead, his half-brother, Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, was seen as the de-facto ruler and the decision-maker of major foreign policy decisions, such as joining a Saudi-led war in Yemen and spearheading an embargo on neighbouring Qatar in recent years. There was no immediate announcement about a successor, although Mohammed bin Zayed is anticipated to claim the presidency. Khalifa, who has rarely been seen in official photos or at public events for years, succeeded his father, the UAE's founder, Sheikh Zayed, in 2004. He suffered a stroke and underwent emergency surgery a decade later, though officials did not release the news until the following day. He has largely been out of public sight ever since. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, Emirati state media published rare photographs and video of Khalifa. In the latest images, Khalifa wore white sneakers and a white traditional robe as he greeted Sheikh Mohammed and other rulers in the Emirates. Khalifa, the eldest son of the UAE's first leader after the federation's formation in 1971, held the most powerful position among the seven semi-autonomous city-states stretching along the shores of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. His role as president derived from his standing as hereditary ruler of Abu Dhabi, the UAE's largest and richest emirate. Abu Dhabi serves as home to the federal capital. Despite its size and vast oil wealth, Abu Dhabi often found itself overshadowed by the glitzy neighbouring emirate of Dubai, the Middle Eastern commercial hub that showcases the UAE's bold visions and, at times, its debt-fuelled pipe dreams, including a massive palm-shaped artificial island, Palm Jebel Ali, that sits empty years after its creation. In 2009, as Dubai's fortunes began to falter along with the global economy, Khalifa led efforts to protect the federation by pumping billions of dollars in emergency bailout funds into Dubai. The two emirates do not always see eye-to-eye on foreign policy decisions and compete commercially with one another. In 2003, he called for the creation of a new airline, Etihad Airways, which competes with Dubai's successful and much larger carrier, Emirates Air. Khalifa increasingly used Abu Dhabi's oil wealth to attract cultural and academic centres, such as branches of the Louvre museum and satellite campuses of New York University and the Sorbonne. He also presided over efforts to move the OPEC country beyond its reliance on petrodollars with investments in renewable energy research, including plans for a futuristic low-carbon desert city known as Masdar.", "092f9522e1cca4fd965d2666a2b3c021598b5cd46a2194f02648ee91": "Temperatures for most of Britain are expected to climb to a possible high of 27C in what would make the warmest spell of the year. Saturday could be '16-19C widely - with 24C the possible high in the south-east', according to Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern. Widespread sunshine is expected from the north of Scotland to the south of England, with just some patchy cloud in northern and western areas. However, the Met Office warned that Saturday's sunshine could be followed by heavy rain and thunderstorms as the air warms up. 'By Saturday evening, those showers would be making an appearance into the south-west [of England], spreading quite widely into southern parts of England and south Wales,' McGivern said. 'In some places, it would just be a spell of rain but for central and southern England and the south coast there is the risk of some heavy downpours, thunderstorms and frequent lightning.' Sunday was likely to be another nice day. Warm air from north Africa isdue to bring above-average temperatures for May to most places in the UK over the next week, but it will be broken up with potentially heavy or thundery showers. The Met Office said that parts of the south-east could potentially reach top temperatures for the week of 25C-27C. Met Office spokesman Richard Miles said 'at the moment Tuesday looks like being the warmest day of the week'. Throughout the week, some people will enjoy warm sunny spells but heavy showers are set to move across the whole of the country, particularly in the north and west. These might be thundery at times in parts of the south, central England and south-west Scotland. The Met Office chief meteorologist, Andy Page, said: 'The plume of warm air we have been expecting from the south will bring higher temperatures across the whole country over the next week. 'However, it looks like the effects from the Atlantic lows will prevent sustained high pressure building from the east. 'This means that while we might see some warm - and in places very warm - days, overall the next week will feel more like what we would expect of a warm spell in May, with some heavy showers around, rather than hot summery weather.'", "7803189a02e6c23df7cbb3331e3127f92fd59a07e37efb605aff020b": "The burkini, or full-body swimsuit, is once again at the centre of a political row in France as Grenoble's town council prepares to debate loosening rules on swimwear at open-air pools. Rules on swimwear are strict at the majority of French public pools. For example, men must wear tight-fitting racing trunks and cannot wear longer board-shorts. Currently, in Grenoble municipal pools, UV-protective tops are banned, except short-sleeved tops for children under ten, or for adults who present a medical note from their doctor. Eric Piolle, the high-profile Green mayor of Grenoble, which sits at the foot of the French Alps, has tabled a motion for Monday's town council meeting to discuss his proposal to allow people to dress 'how they like' at outdoor pools. The new rules would allow women as well as men to swim topless and all swimmers to wear full-body swimsuits - whether for sun-protection or personal religious beliefs. The rightwing head of the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region, Laurent Wauquiez, has threatened to pull all regional funding to the city if the rules are loosened. 'Mr Piolle intends to authorise the burkini in municipal pools. I'm warning him: if he does, the region will cut all funding to the city of Grenoble,' Wauquiez tweeted. 'Not a centime' of regional money 'will finance your submission to Islamism,' he added. An open-letter signed by Jean-Pierre Barbier, the rightwing head of the departement council, and his party's elected officials, said: 'The burkini aims, quite simply, to impose Islamist standards at the heart of swimming and public leisure.' Other elected officials signed an open letter opposing full-body swimsuits, which they said represented 'the oppression and inferiority of women'. Christophe Ferrari, the leftwing former Socialist party head of the Grenoble-Alpes region, opposed the plans and said Piolle was on an 'incomprehensible' one-man 'crusade'. The row has been seized upon in the run up to parliamentary elections next month, where the centrist grouping of the newly re-elected president Emmanuel Macron is hoping to win a majority but is facing a challenge from an alliance of leftwing parties, which is led by the radical left's Jean-Luc Melenchon and includes Greens and Socialists. On the far-right, Marine Le Pen's National Rally party is also aiming to increase its seats. Le Pen used the burkini row to attack the broad leftwing parliamentary alliance, saying this week that group included 'defenders of burkinis in pools'. It is not the first time full-body swimwear has sparked a political row just before a key election. In the summer of 2016, in the run-up to the 2017 presidential election, about 30 French coastal resorts banned the burkini from beaches, following an initiative by the rightwing mayor of Cannes. The country's highest administrative court ruled that the anti-burkini decrees were 'a serious and manifestly illegal attack on fundamental freedoms', including the right to move around in public and the freedom of conscience. In Grenoble, Piolle said the new pool rules were not solely about burkinis and that the burkini was a 'non-issue'. He said the row showed that the quality of French public political debate was on a downward spiral. 'Stop stigmatising and discriminating against Muslims in our country,' he said in an interview on France 2 TV.  Piolle said the loosening of pool rules was about lifting 'discriminatory' restrictions in the name of health and equality. 'Stop transforming women into sexual objects by saying what they should wear,' he said. The row has refocused attention on secularism in France, where the republic is built on a strict separation of church and state, intended to foster equality for all private beliefs. This requires the state to be neutral in terms of religion and allows everyone the freedom to practise their faith as long as there is no threat to public order. Piolle said burkinis in pools had nothing to do with French secularism. State officials in France are required not to wear ostentatious religious symbols at work to protect state neutrality, but Piolle said users of public services, such as swimmers, were simply members of the public who were free to dress as they pleased. In a video posted on Twitter, Piolle said: 'We want a public service that is accessible to everyone.' The proposed new swimwear rules will be debated at a Grenoble council meeting on 16 May.", "667a206b9ab98447f4326166feeb6a6973eb2e0ecaa8019d4a56ce41": "The US coast guard has found an additional seven survivors from the capsizing of a vessel carrying Haitian migrants near Puerto Rico, a coast guard spokesperson said on Friday, taking the total number of survivors to 38 with the death toll unchanged at 11. The vessel, which was first spotted on Thursday north of Desecheo Island, an uninhabited island in the archipelago of Puerto Rico, the US territory, was carrying mostly Haitian migrants as well as two citizens of the Dominican Republic, a spokesman said. 'Of these survivors, eight remain hospitalized,' the spokesman told Reuters. 'Search efforts continue.' The coast guard on Thursday had reported 31 survivors. Migrants, particularly from Haiti, have in recent months been attempting to escape gang violence and poverty through dangerous voyages on unseaworthy vessels, with a string of tragic losses at sea.

It was, until the restaurant closed in 2020, the site of a notorious, third-floor space dubbed 'the rape room' by several employees who claimed that the private dining enclave was ground zero for sexual harassment by management. The rape room lives on as a darkly symbolic story in the city's hospitality business. Mario Batali, the celebrity chef and investor in Spotted Pig, was a frequent visitor and also accused of criminal behavior on the third floor, including groping and kissing a woman who appeared to be unconscious in 2008. 'We called him the Red Menace,' Trish Nelson, a former server, told the New York Times. 'He tried to touch my breasts and told me that they were beautiful. He wanted to wrestle. As I was serving drinks to his table, he told me I should sit on his friend's face.' Last week, Batali, 61, was found not guilty of indecent assault and battery after a swift trial in Boston in a case unrelated to the Spotted Pig accusations. Batali had waived his right to have a jury decide his fate in a criminal case that arose from the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault. Judge James Stanton of Boston municipal court agreed with Batali's lawyers that the accuser, Natali Tene, 32, who said Batali forcibly kissed and grabbed her during a late-night selfie session at a Boston bar in April 2017, was not an entirely credible witness. But the judge also rebuked Batali. 'It's an understatement to say that Mr Batali did not cover himself in glory on the night in question. His conduct, his appearance and his demeanor were not befitting of a public person of his stature at that time.' The prosecutor in the case, Kevin Hayden, said he was disappointed in the verdict but grateful that Tene had come forward. 'It can be incredibly difficult for a victim to disclose a sexual assault,' Hayden said, adding that when the perpetrator was 'in a position of power or celebrity, the decision to report an assault can become all the more challenging and intimidating'. The outcome of the Batali trial has drawn attention to the issue of harassment in the American hospitality business, although Tene was a customer - not an employee - of the bar where the interaction occurred. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has said that the abuse she experienced as a bartender at Coffee Shop, a now-closed bar-restaurant on Union Square well known for employing models and actors, prepared her for political life in Washington. 'When you work in the service industry as a woman, you are harassed all the time. It's just part of your job,' Ocasio-Cortez once told the Hollywood Reporter. 'You're often spoken to in a way that is very classist. You are treated like a servant. So you really get used to navigating those dynamics.' According to a Social Science Research Solutions (SSRS) survey published by One Fair Wage in January 2021, 71% of female workers had been sexually harassed at least once during their time in the restaurant industry - the highest of any industry reporting statistics. Harassment complaints come to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from restaurant industry workers more often than from any other sector. In the SSRS survey, 44% stated they had been victims of sexual harassment by someone in a management or ownership role, and sexual harassment occurred at a rate far higher for tipped staff - ie service staff - than their non-tipped counterparts. 'Tipped workers were more likely to be treated in sexist ways; more likely to be targeted with sexually aggressive and degrading behavior; received more persistent and intrusive sexual attention, and were more likely to be coerced or threatened into sexual activity,' the report said. Tipped workers were also more likely than their non-tipped counterparts to say that they had been encouraged to 'just forget about it', and virtually all said they had experienced some form of retaliation for speaking out. 'Sexual harassment runs rampant in the restaurant industry. The stakes are high, as restaurant jobs can be high-paying and hard to come by. So when food service workers are sexually harassed, they often do not complain out of fear of retaliation,' said Eric Baum, the New York attorney who represents Tene in her civil claim against Batali. Baum says that sexual harassment laws protecting restaurant workers are not often enforced. 'Accordingly, many restaurant managers and supervisors believe that the strict standards prohibiting sexual harassment do not apply to them.' A study conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Notre Dame, Penn State University and the Emlyon Business School in France found that dependence on tips, coupled with the 'service with a smile' job description, created a direct link to harassment. In the Batali case, prosecutor Nina Bonelli said that Tene had tried to 'de-escalate' the unwanted touching by simply 'smiling it off' in the photos. 'The kissing, the groping. She never asked for it. She never consented to it,' she said. 'She just wanted a selfie.' Batali's acquittal in the Boston case follows the New York attorney general's finding that Batali and his business partner Joseph Bastianich, their management company B&B Hospitality and their New York restaurants Babbo, Lupa and the now-closed Del Posto fostered a hostile work environment that permitted a sexualized culture of misconduct and harassment.  Under an agreement last year, Batali, Bastianich and the company agreed to pay $600,000 to at least 20 former employees. 'Celebrity and fame does not absolve someone from following the law. Sexual harassment is unacceptable for anyone, anywhere - no matter how powerful the perpetrator,' said the attorney general, Letitia James. Batali had earlier apologized, acknowledging the allegations 'match up' with ways he had acted. 'I have made many mistakes,' he said in an email newsletter at the time. 'My behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility.'", "37a8080ac291f35c861cbc41839926469bc9e623e0eed4b34c869af0": "Earlier this week, Jinshiro Motoyama placed a banner outside the office of Japan's prime minister, sat on a folding chair, and stopped eating. It was a dramatic gesture, but the 30-year-old activist believes desperate measures are needed to end the long US military presence in his birthplace, Okinawa. Located roughly 1,000 miles south of Tokyo in the East China Sea, Okinawa is a speck in the ocean that comprises 0.6% of Japan's total land area but hosts about 70% of the US's military bases in Japan and more than half of its 47,000 troops. As the island, the scene of one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific war, prepares on Sunday to mark 50 years since it was returned to Japanese sovereignty from postwar US control, Motoyama is in no mood to celebrate. 'The Japanese government wants there to be a celebratory mood, but that is not possible when you consider that the situation over US bases is still unresolved,' the 30-year-old graduate student told reporters on Friday, the fifth day of his hunger strike. He acknowledged that Okinawa's 1.4 million people had become more affluent - although the collection of islands is still the poorest of Japan's 47 prefectures - over the past half a century, but said the island was still being treated like a quasi-colonial outpost. 'The biggest issue since reversion to Japan, and since the end of the second world war, is the presence of US military bases, which have been disproportionately built in Okinawa.' The debate over the US military footprint is dominated by the future of Futenma, a US marine corps airbase located in the middle of a densely populated city, to an offshore location in Henoko, a fishing village in the remote northern half of the main Okinawan island. Critics say the Henoko base will destroy the area's delicate marine ecosystem and threaten the safety of about 2,000 residents living near the site. Opposition to the US military presence on Okinawa surged after the 1995 abduction and rape of a 12-year-old girl by three US servicemen. The following year, Japan and the US agreed to reduce the US footprint by moving Futenma's personnel and military hardware to Henoko. But most Okinawans want the new base to be built elsewhere in Japan. Okinawa's anti-base governor, Denny Tamaki, has vowed to fight the Henoko move - a stance backed by more than 70% of voters in a non-binding 2019 prefecture-wide referendum that Motoyama helped organise. In a brief meeting this week with Japan's prime minister, Fumio Kishida, Tamaki urged him to resolve the Henoko base controversy through dialogue. 'I hope the government will ... fully recognise Okinawans' views,' said Tamaki, the son of a Japanese woman and a US marine whom he has never met. In response, the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said the government aimed to reduce the island's burden, but insisted that there was no alternative to building a new base in Henoko. Motoyama, who is demanding an immediate end to base construction work and a substantial reduction in the US military presence, accused the Japanese government of ignoring the democratic will of the Okinawan people. 'It simply refused to accept the result of the referendum,' he said. 'How much longer will the people of Okinawa have to bear this situation? Unless the military base problem is resolved, the reversion and the tragedy of the second world war will never truly be over for the people of Okinawa.' On the eve of the anniversary of the end of the US occupation of Okinawa, local opposition to the US military presence remains high. A poll by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper and Okinawan media organisations found that 61% of local people wanted fewer US bases on the island, while 19% said they were happy with the status quo. Supporters of a continued role for 'fortress Okinawa' point to the security risks posed by a nuclear armed North Korea and a more assertive China, whose navy has recently increased its activities in waters near Okinawa, with fighter jets taking off and landing on the aircraft carrier Liaoning every day for more than a week. Fears in Japan that China could attempt to retake Taiwan or forcibly claim the disputed Senkaku islands - located less than 124 miles (200km) away - have risen since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. MPs from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party have called for the country to acquire missiles that can strike targets in enemy territory - weapons that could be deployed on one of Okinawa's smaller 'frontline' islands. Rising tensions in the region have made Okinawa a target, not a cornerstone of deterrence, according to Masaaki Gabe, a professor emeritus at the University of Ryukyus, who was 17 when the US occupation ended. 'Okinawa will be the frontline in the case of a war or conflict between Japan and China,' Gabe said. 'After 50 years, the insecure feeling still continues.' Motoyama agreed. 'I believe there is a risk that Okinawa could again become the scene of a battle,' he said referring to an invasion by US troops in April 1945 in which 94,000 civilians - about a quarter of Okinawa's population - died, along with 94,000 Japanese soldiers and 12,500 US troops. Demands by Okinawa's residents to lighten their burden by moving some US military facilities to other parts of Japan have been ignored. The government has also refused to amend the Japan-US status of forces agreement, which critics say protects US service personnel accused of serious crimes, including rape. Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan, said he doubted many Okinawans would be celebrating the past 50 years under Japanese sovereignty. 'They are unhappy with reversion because the US military remains entrenched,' he said. 'Local people do not think of the bases as shields but rather as targets. And crime and environmental problems connected to the bases mean the Americans are continuing to outstay their welcome.' Motoyama, who has had no contact with Japanese government officials, said he would continue his hunger strike until Sunday's anniversary, despite criticism on social media that it was pointless. 'I want people to think about why I'm having to do this,' he said. 'However loudly Okinawan people make their voices heard, no matter what they do, they are ignored by the Japanese government. Nothing has changed in 50 years.'

The move, which leaves the assembly unable to function, marks an escalation after the party previously indicated it would not nominate for the position of deputy first minister because of its hostility to the post-Brexit trading arrangements. Ninety newly elected members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) gathered at Stormont, outside Belfast, on Friday for what was meant to be the first day of business since the election. Under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, the main nationalist and unionist parties are obliged to share power. Power sharing between the blocs requires both sides to agree on a speaker before electing a cross-community government. After Sinn Fein emerged in elections as the largest party for the first time, it meant the new first minister would be the party's leader at Stormont, Michelle O'Neill. The party has said it will not nominate ministers to form a new executive until its concerns about the Northern Ireland protocol, which sets out post-Brexit trading arrangements for the country, are resolved. Unionists oppose the treaty because of the extent of the economic barriers it creates between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP's leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said on Friday: 'The protocol is a direct challenge to the principles that have underpinned every agreement reached in Northern Ireland over the last 25 years. It erodes the very foundations that devolution has been built upon.' New MLAs have been signing in. They designate themselves as 'nationalist' or 'unionist' - an arrangement designed to facilitate cross-community voting on certain key decisions - though members who do not wish to designate as either category are considered to be 'others'. There has continued to be pressure from Sinn Fein and from other parties including the Alliance party, which has become Stormont's third-largest party for the first time. The Alliance leader, Naomi Long, said on Friday morning: 'It's hugely frustrating, as members of society, that we're not going to have a government formed, that we're not even going to have an assembly where the basics can be done, like scrutinising ministers who are still in post ' The assembly cannot fully operate without a speaker. This means bills cannot be scrutinised, debates cannot take place. New ministers, a new first minister and a new deputy first minister cannot be elected. But the situation is worse than anticipated after the DUP had signalled it would in effect stand in the way of the the appointment of a first and deputy first minister in the power-sharing executive. Northern Ireland is left with a caretaker government. As a result of legislation introduced a few months ago, ministers are still technically in their posts and in charge of portfolios, but they are very limited in what they can do and, for example, cannot take cross-departmental decisions. Experts warn the situation cannot continue and governance in Northern Ireland will eventually come to a halt as the focus continues to shift to what the UK government will do. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has reiterated her threat to scrap parts of the protocol, which she has described as 'the greatest obstacle' to forming a new Northern Ireland executive. Boris Johnson is expected to give a speech as soon as Monday on the future of the protocol after exchanges between Truss and the European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, which a UK source described as 'tetchy'.", "51ace27f13a99b53bd6ac633e16c9ab23bf2e60f13cd31753000de25": "In Latham, in Western Australia's wheat belt, the telltale signs of mice holes are everywhere on Dylan Hirsch's canola farm. As winter approaches, the rodents have moved in, digging up seeds before they've germinated and chewing his newly laid crop. 'The numbers are higher than I've seen and building,' he says. 'In previous years, we saw isolated areas of paddocks which have had mice eating young seedlings. 'But this year we're seeing mice activity right across some of our paddocks - as well as in the house and sheds.' Australian farmers are on high alert for a second coming of the mouse plague that ravaged north-west New South Wales and southern Queensland last year. Images of homes and crops overrun with record numbers of mice shocked Australians, and farmers are still recovering from the impact of losing millions of dollars' worth of crops.  The NSW Farmers vice president, Xavier Martin, says patchy reports of mouse activity have already been detected, 'surprising' and concerning his members. 'We're getting reports in areas that were plagued this time last year but also areas that weren't so intense ... it's coming in everywhere,' he says. Martin says La Nina patterns that caused heavy, prolonged rainfall prevented a surge of mice this summer. But the same wet conditions also fostered a bumper harvest, which had left pastures heavily seeded and a lot of grain in the paddock for rodents to snack on. 'Even though there's only low numbers, they're becoming quite obvious around hay sheds and more elevated parts of paddocks,' he says.  In the central NSW city of Dubbo - hard hit last year - Andrew Johnson has begun trapping and killing mice. 'They came from nowhere ... it's not one or two, it's 20,' he says. 'They're not small.' CSIRO mouse researcher Steve Henry says farmers have reported increased mice numbers in northern NSW, central Queensland, north-west Victoria and South Australia's Yorke Peninsula. But the wheat belt of Western Australia has been worst hit. 'There are widespread high numbers [there]. They've got a nasty outbreak for the second year in a row,' he says. 'It's a little unusual ... but they did have a fantastic season last year and in some cases there was a lot of food left behind after the harvest as a result of hailstorms or frost.' On Western Australia's south coast, Max Szulc has caught more than 2,000 mice on his Esperance property in a matter of weeks. 'I've never had so many mice in all the time I've lived here,' he says. 'It was a perfect summer breeding environment for the numbers to build up. 'I'm waiting for a weather event to kill off most of them.' Some 500km closer to Perth, Braydyn Grylls is baiting on his farm in Bulyee, nestled in the state's central wheat belt. 'We've never had mice problems here before. It's the first time we've ever baited,' he says. 'They've increased in numbers and damaged our canola ... It's early stages but a good five metre squared around the holes they've chewed it off. 'I've seen them in the paddocks. They're running riot through the house and sheds.' Grylls puts it down to a high amount of feed left over from last year for the mice to eat, and the wet year getting them breeding early. 'I've dug some of the burrows up and you can see their new offspring in there - four or five ready to come out ... that's going to be the next plague,' he says. The CSIRO's Henry says as the weather cools, mice are moving into sheds and dwellings, and with lots of food around, they're stocking their pantries. 'It's not the broad, widespread outbreak we were seeing last year but we're counselling vigilance,' he says. Henry says farmers from Geraldton to the Mallee, Wimmera and the Riverina are spreading mice bait as they sow their winter crop to try to keep numbers down before breeding season in spring. In an ominous sign of what may come, Henry says farmers he's spoken to in Wagga Wagga have been 'absolutely shocked' to find mouse holes littered across their paddocks after burning off in preparation to sow. Other areas, like Maryborough on Queensland's Fraser Coast, are reporting 20 to 30 mice in homes at night. Last year, the NSW government introduced a rebate for the pesticide zinc phosphide bait as part if a $150m package to deal with out-of-control rodent numbers. Henry urges farmers to get out and walk through their crops. 'One of the key times farmers can deal with mice is as they sow their crop - it's a good, strategic time to apply bait.' The breeding season for rodents begins at the end of winter when, from six weeks old, mice can have up to 10 babies every 21 days. 'As soon as they give birth, they fall pregnant with their second litter, there's no break,' Henry says. 'Over in the west they've got a two-year trajectory where numbers went high, plateaued and have gone again in spring ... We want to make sure it won't be the same scenario in NSW, where they've been so badly affected. 'Given some crops are going to be worth a lot of money this year, it's a form of insurance to keep those mice numbers low ... so you can be on the front foot.' NSW Farmers' Martin says the state needs to remain 'on alert' after the destruction of last season and monitor the infestation before food crops are spoiled. A survey of more than 1,000 farmers last year found one third estimated stored grain and fodder losses between $50,000 and $150,000 due to mice damage. 'We know in the last plague what seemed to be low numbers exploded without a lot of warning into the springtime ... It's far easier to deal with these rodents proactively than to try and react once we have huge populations,' he says. In Western Australia's wheat belt, Hirsch is trying to be proactive to avoid a repeat of devastating scenes from NSW last year. 'We, like many farmers, are spreading mouse bait in our canola paddocks, which can be particularly prone to damage,' he says. 'The high price of grain and inputs means damage is greater risk to us than normal, which is making us more likely to bait to protect our crop, rather than wait and see.'", "cf495459f686d127fd62530100fbf116ebe5885538d50216003e50a9": "New Zealand's finance minister is one week out from the most important date in his professional calendar - delivering the next budget. And he could be in for a tough sell. The image Grant Robertson carefully cultivates is of a disciplined spender and a fiscal policy nerd, joking that it's 'great to have a bit of public finance in the morning' and claiming that infrastructure deficits keep him up at night. It is an image he needs to maintain in order to weather another unstable year and hold on to the votes Labour hoovered up from traditional rightwing voters in 2020. The budget - due to be delivered on Thursday - will be a key moment for setting the political scene as the country heads towards a 2023 election. 'This one is about security,' Robertson says of budget 2022. 'It's about providing New Zealanders with a secure future that is built off of that kind of low emissions, high wage economy.' 'Balance', 'reset' and 'security' are words Robertson has used frequently in his budget announcements over the past few weeks as he seeks to reassure the public that the economy is in safe hands. In the first pre-budget speech last week, Robertson provided a glimpse of what budget 2022 will entail: big spending on health and the environment, new commitments on borrowing limits and debt targets and a goal to look at long-term spending over short-term cash injections. It is the fourth budget he has put together using the 'wellbeing approach', which includes a broader range of outcomes including health to assess policy success and which first grabbed international headlines in 2019. Robertson admits Covid disrupted the wellbeing budgets of the past two years and they were not 'quite how [he] envisioned them', but now that this budget is 'less of a crisis budget', the government is returning to its original wellbeing framework, he says. It is also third budget to be overshadowed by Covid. But unlike the past two years, where the government was buoyed up by its success in managing the pandemic, and extraordinary popularity, this year the shine is fading and its spending will be scrutinised more intensely as a result. The opposition leader, Christopher Luxon, has regularly accused the government of being 'addicted to spending' and alleged that it is driving up inflation. 'We don't need cuts to spending and public services but we do need to make sure that any wasteful spending or any incremental new spending, we're getting a return from it,' he told RNZ last month. With food prices at a record high, inflation at its highest in three decades, fuel prices topping $3 a litre and eye-watering housing costs, Labour has been paying for it in the polls. Robertson is 'not surprised' with the shift in numbers. 'After having fought our way through Covid and sacrificed a lot, we've now got this global inflation shock. People are tired ... and they're a bit grumpy.' While Jacindamania could perhaps now better be described as Jacinda-meh-nia, Robertson says Jacinda Ardern is still the best person for the job. 'Jacinda is still really well respected in New Zealand. She's a great leader and she's somebody who I think has got the vision and the wherewithal to lead us.' If there is a moment to steady the ship, it is now. For Robertson, that means investing significantly in the worn-out health system and pumping money into climate change solutions - big-ticket concerns he says he 'owes to people'. 'If we don't get on with the job of addressing climate-change issues, our children and our grandchildren will not forgive us for it, and they'd be right not to,' he says. But this year's budget may not provide the immediate relief many New Zealanders struggling with day-to-day costs are looking for. Robertson is quick to reel off some of the responses the government has already made to the cost-of-living crisis, including increased winter energy payments, a reduction on fuel excise duties, halved public transport fares and benefit boosts. The crisis is 'clearly putting significant pressure on households', he says. 'I believe my job as the minister of finance is to deal with the here and now but also look ahead because it's very hard for individual households to do that,' he says. 'We're not going to lower fuel prices by cutting health spending.' The government is 'in between a rock and a hard place for the first time in two years', with both the Covid response falling away and the cost of living crisis ballooning, says Ben Thomas, a political commentator and former National government staffer. 'It is a bit of a global phenomenon and equally tricky for every government everywhere in the world. 'They [just brought] down petrol prices by 25 cents, and that reduction has basically been entirely eaten away since it was announced six weeks ago.' The government is back in same position it was, but with more pressure to meet the public's expectations for a response, Thomas says. 'You could probably get anybody to agree [the big ticket items] are important but they don't do a lot in the short term to fix rising inflation and the rising cost of living.' Still, finance ministers tend to under-promise and over-deliver on budget day, he says. 'Robertson - it should never be forgotten - was the architect of Helen Clark's interest-free student loans policy, which was cobbled together at very short notice and pretty much won them the 2005 election.' Despite some of the discontent indicated in the polls, he remains upbeat, saying: 'We've got some of the best economic indicators, be it around debt or GDP or how quickly we're getting back to surplus or unemployment ... It's challenging and tough times - I'm not pretending it isn't - but we're in a better position than most to get through it.'", "3809f4e627be47370c245bbe8fd4c02c485f5fa5606e013f811e63c2": "The aim was to be the invisible man, says Igor Pedin, 61. It was to drift, as if a ghost, with his small trolley bag of supplies and dog Zhu-Zhu, a nine-year-old mongrel terrier, through the hellscape of the besieged port city of Mariupol, out into the badlands of Russian-occupied territories and on to the relative safety of the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia - a mere 225km walk away. The equivalent of walking by foot from London to Sheffield but through a war unseen in its scale in Europe since 1945 and towards the oncoming convoys of tanks, armoured vehicles and nervous trigger-happy Russian soldiers racing towards Mariupol; it meant sidestepping mines and crossing destroyed bridges with his dog and luggage, where an erring step would lead to a 30ft drop to certain death; he would have to pass the smouldering homes and weeping men and women with their heartbreaking stories of death and suffering and their loss of will to live on. Pedin, a former ship's cook, could not have known any of this - and he did not prove to be invisible, he concedes, as he recounts his tale in the safety of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Indeed, such would be his extraordinary feat that on one remarkable night Russian soldiers at one of the many checkpoints he would pass through gathered in the quiet of the evening to hear his story, stuffing cigarettes into his pockets for the onward journey and wishing him luck. He may not have been invisible, Pedin repeats, the tears welling in a rare moment of emotion. But he was, he adds, lucky. Pedin's final decision to leave Mariupol was made on 20 April, he recalls, when the Russian soldiers had reached his part of the city and were going house to house, shooting at will. There was already little left to stay for; there was scant food or water, the dead were piling up in the streets. Pedin prepared meticulously. He packed a bag, weighed it and challenged himself to reduce the initial 70-kilo weight to 50.  The initial task for Pedin and Zhu-Zhu was to traverse the five kilometres to the city outskirts, an aim that he had little faith could be achieved. He left his home on Tkochenko-Petrenko street near Mariupol's port at 6am on 23 April and it took two hours to stumble through the craters, twisted steel and unexploded ordnance, north up Kyprino Street, where dead bodies were strewn, and on to the Port City shopping mall. Russian soldiers were handing out food and water at the end of long queues of desperate ashen-faced people. He stole by the crowds, avoiding eye contact with the soldiers, and walked up Zaporizhzhia Road. 'I looked like a vagabond to them, I was nothing. I was dirty and covered from dust, as my house had been filled with a fog of smoke. I walked out of the city by this motorway and at the top I turned around. I looked back down at the city and I said to myself, it was the right decision. I said goodbye. There was an explosion. I turned and walked on.' He walked by burnt-out military vehicles, just his dog and the noise of shelling behind him until a convoy of armoured vehicles, so heavy they made the asphalt under his feet tremble, swept past. He crouched down, taking Zhu-Zhu, terrified, into his coat, until they passed. 'I was an invisible man then,' he recalls. 'What am I to them: who is this shadow?' His aim was the town of Nikolske, 20km away. By the time he reached the first houses, it was getting dark and very cold. 'I saw a man ahead outside his house. He said, 'Young man would you like to drink with me. Today I buried my son. Let's drink to my son.'' Pedin gave up drinking 15 years ago but he could not refuse. He had two shots of vodka, while his new friend emptied the bottle. 'He told me that Russians had killed his 16-year-old son on 3 March in Mariupol. Shrapnel had taken off his head. After he had disappeared he spent weeks looking for him in Mariupol. He found the grave, and Russian soldiers said he would have to dig him up with his hands if he wanted the body. He told me, 'I want to die - I will kill myself.'' Pedin slept on the couch that night, waking at 6am. He knew the only way out towards Zaporizhzhia was through the town. 'As I left the town there was a checkpoint: Chechens. They had seen me and two of them came towards me. 'Where are you going? Where have you come from,' they asked. 'Have you been through the filtration camp.'' A commander appeared and called someone on a radio. 'A minivan turned up and three big men came out and I was put in the van. We drove 2km back to Nikolske and came to a two-storey council building, which they had surrounded with steel fencing. There were about 40 people waiting in the grounds but the van drove to the building entrance.' Pedin left his bag outside and tied up Zhu-Zhu before being taken to the second floor. 'A Russian officer sat in front of a desk asked me where I was going. I lied. I said I had a stomach ulcer and needed to get to Zaporizhzhia as I had paid for treatment. I was told to take off my top and they looked for tattoos. I had a bruise on my shoulder and they accused me of having had a rifle. He demanded, 'where are your tattoos?' He said, 'You are boring me. Maybe I should beat you?' I said, 'As you wish, commander.' But I was taken to another room where there were four military women with PCs, and they scanned my fingerprints, put me up against a wall and took mugshots.' He was given a document from the so-called ministry of internal affairs of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. He was free to leave and set off again with his dog and bag to the checkpoint. 'The Chechens said they would get the next car to take me to the next village at Rozivka. I was there for two hours. They were bored and talked to me, giving me cigarettes. None of the drivers would take me, so I said, guys, I will just walk. One said, 'No, this is my authority', pointing at his gun.' After an hour, a black minivan pulled up and the Chechens demanded that the driver, who was travelling with his wife and two daughters, aged about 18 and 20, take Pedin. 'No one said a word. They took me to Rozivka. On the way, I noticed in the fields large diggers digging up holes. And further down there were crosses. I am sure they were mass graves.' On arrival at Rozivka, Pedin walked down Lenina street out of town and came to another checkpoint which he passed easily with his new document and kept on walking. By the time he came to the next village, Verzhyna, it was pitch black. 'Suddenly flashlights blinded me. There were six soldiers, they barked at me, I put up my hands. They told me to take my top off, emptied my bag. It was freezing. They ordered me to follow them. We went inside the House of Culture [a community centre] which was their headquarters.' Pedin was given some canned beef and some soup and put in a small room that had a steel bed in the corner. He was told that if he left earlier than the morning that he would be shot - but was free to go the following day. He crept past the sleeping soldiers in the morning and nodded to one on watch as he left. He walked for 14 hours that day reaching another checkpoint at around 8pm to be searched again. The soldiers pointed him towards a small abandoned house where he could sleep. But he was off again at 6am as the sun rose. 'I saw a big man in his 60s. He asked, 'Where are you from?' I said Mariupol, and he called to his wife to bring food. They gave me a bag of bread, onion, fried pork, cucumber. They insisted. And I walked on.' By now, Pedin was exhausted and yet the greatest obstacle was to come. The road bridge he needed to pass over had been destroyed, leaving a 30-metre sheer drop on to railway tracks below. 'You can cheat people but not a destroyed bridge.' The bridge's metal frame was still in place, however, with two beams: one narrow one below and one broader one at shoulder height. Pedin tied up his dog with his bag and tested the crossing. It was doable. He went back and crossed again with his bag. Then he returned and took his dog, who walked on the beam above, with Pedin holding the lead. 'I just shouted, 'We did it.'' They approached the next checkpoint. The soldier demanded to know where my companion was. 'I said I only had my dog. Then they wanted to know how I had crossed the bridge.' Pedin was told he could stay the night in the back half of a radio van that had been hit by a Ukrainian shell at the front. It was dark now. Pedin's story was exactly the sort of diversion the bored soldiers needed. Five gathered around him, to hear of his adventures, and daring deeds across the bridge. 'One wanted to keep in touch, he was saying that after the war I should stay with him. There was nothing for me to say.' Pedin slept in his chair, with Zhu-Zhu under his coat. The next morning, he was told he was not allowed to carry on via the road to Zaporizhzhia but had to choose to go back or south to the city of Tokmak. Pedin headed towards the city but faced two big hills. 'The dog just couldn't go on. I had to walk up the road with my bag, and then come back for him and carry him up. I said, 'If you don't walk we will both die, you have to walk.' He walked up the next hill.' Off the road was Tarasivka, a small village. 'I saw the top of the head of a man in a window and called to him. I gave him some of the soldiers' cigarettes, I even had menthol cigarettes. The only way to Zaporizhzhia was on small roads and over a dam and then to take what he said was the smugglers' track.' He did as he was instructed. But after the dam, there was a crossroads - and no indication of which way to go. Pedin's luck struck again. 'A truck appeared. I called out. I said, 'I am from Mariupol.' The door opened. We drove for two hours, through weaving roads. I would have never have found my way. We said nothing. At the checkpoints, this man said just two words to the Donetsk People's Republic militia and he was let through.' Pedin saw a Ukrainian flag ahead, where soldiers checked the men's documents and let them go. 'The driver dropped me in central Zaporizhzhia by a tent. He had said nothing on the journey but gave me 1,000 hryvnia (PS30). He said good luck. He understood everything - what was there to say?' Pedin walked into the tent, full of volunteers. He was asked by a woman whether he needed help. He went quiet and then said yes.  'The lady asked, 'where have you come from?' I said, 'I have come from Mariupol.' She screamed: 'Mariupol!'' Pedin recalls with a smile. 'She shouted out to everyone, this man has come from Mariupol on foot. Everyone stopped. I suppose it was my moment of glory.'", "cf9ea8e6aebee260be10471cc560dce98cf21a6d12872d175204c9b5": "A California coastal panel on Thursday rejected a longstanding proposal to build a $1.4bn seawater desalination plant to turn Pacific Ocean water into drinking water as the state grapples with persistent drought that is expected to worsen in coming years with climate change. The state's Coastal Commission voted unanimously to deny a permit for Poseidon Water to build a plant to produce 50m gallons of water a day in Huntington Beach, south-east of Los Angeles. Poseidon said it was disappointed in the decision. 'California continues to face a punishing drought, with no end in sight,' a company statement said. 'Every day, we see new calls for conservation as reservoir levels drop to dangerous lows. We firmly believe that this desalination project would have created a sustainable, drought-tolerant source of water.' The vote came after a heated meeting before the commission attended by dozens of supporters and critics of the plan. It was considered a crucial decision on the future of the plant after years of other hearings and delays. Poseidon's long-running proposal was supported by Governor Gavin Newsom but faced ardent opposition from environmentalists who said drawing in large amounts of ocean water and releasing salty discharge back into the ocean would kill billions of tiny marine organisms that make up the base of the food chain along a large swath of the coast. 'The ocean is under attack' from climate change already, Commissioner Dayna Bochco said. 'I cannot say in good conscience that this amount of damage is OK.' Other critics said the water would be too expensive and was not urgently needed in the area where it would be built, which is less dependent on state and federal water due to an ample aquifer and water recycling program. Commissioners cited those issues in following a staff recommendation and rejecting the proposal. They also cited the energy cost of running the plant and the fact that it would sit in an earthquake fault zone. Before voting, the 12-member commission heard hours of comments from scores of people packed into a hotel meeting room in the Orange county city of Costa Mesa in addition to those tuning in online. At the meeting, supporters wore orange and yellow construction vests and toted signs saying 'support desal!' Opponents carried signs reading 'No Poseidon' and 'Do not $ell our coast.' One woman who wore a plankton costume and held a sign reading 'I am a plankton - please do not kill me!' California has spent most of the last 15 years in drought conditions. Its normal wet season that runs from late fall to the end of winter was especially dry this year and as a result 95% of the state is classified as in severe drought. Newsom last summer urged residents to cut consumption by 15%, but since then water usage has dropped by only about 3%. Some areas have begun instituting generally mild restrictions such as limiting how many days lawns can be watered. More stringent restrictions are likely later in the year. Much of California's water comes from melting snow and with a far below normal snowpack, state officials have told water agencies they will receive only 5% of what they have requested from state water supplies beyond what's needed for critical activities like drinking and bathing. Desalination removes salt and other elements from ocean water to make it drinkable. Those elements are discharged back into the sea, while the water can be channeled directly to consumers or used to replenish a groundwater basin. The country's largest seawater desalination plant is already operating in nearby San Diego county, and there are also coastal plants in Florida. The idea of desalination has been debated for decades in Huntington Beach, a coastal community south-east of Los Angeles known as 'Surf City USA' that relies on its sands and waves for tourism. Discussion of the project has recently focused on the impact of climate change on regional water supplies and on sea level rise in the low-lying coastal area where the plant would be built. More than two decades ago, Poseidon proposed building two desalination plants - the one in San Diego county, and one in Huntington Beach. The San Diego county plant was approved and built, and desalinated water now accounts for 10% of San Diego county water district's water supplies. But the Huntington Beach project has faced numerous delays. In 2013, the Coastal Commission voiced concerns that the proposed use of intake structures to quickly draw in large volumes of water from the ocean would damage marine life. Poseidon, which is owned by Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, conducted additional studies and resubmitted the plan with a proposal to mitigate marine damage through restoration of nearby wetlands.", "87f2265f6c626244d1518fd0e315b51f841c4c03cf469bfb67a6332a": "", "15aaaa487c01d08542a4a5af36728d50ac49592fd48e83583308bc4e": "", "54cd298a41b510f1c0df06f87df07a01c96f7903208bc207851260c9": "", "fd28fd8d6e664ba93beef9d0ad7068aebc2d3447f584b1bc3867f64a": "Joe Biden's secretary of state has issued a statement condemning Israeli forces for their attack hours earlier on the funeral procession in Jerusalem of a Palestinian American journalist who was shot and killed this week.

When they began walking toward the gates of St Joseph's Hospital, Israeli police officers, in an apparent bid to stop them proceeding by foot rather than taking the coffin by car, burst through the courtyard gates and charged at the crowd. Some beat pallbearers with batons and kicked them. At one point the group carrying her coffin backed against a wall and almost dropped the casket, recovering it just before one end hit the ground as stun grenades detonated. The violent scenes, which lasted only minutes, added to Palestinian outrage over Abu Akleh's killing, which has threatened to fuel violence that has surged since March. The show of force came after people circumvented roadblocks in occupied East Jerusalem to join the slain Al Jazeera reporter's funeral procession. Mourners chanted 'Palestine!', sang the Palestinian national anthem and waved Palestinian flags before Israeli police cracked down on the procession, accusing participants of disrupting public order. Israel forbids the public display of Palestinian flags, even at rallies and protests. Abu Aqleh died after being shot in the head in the West Bank city of Jenin on Wednesday morning. Her colleagues have since said that she was killed in a burst of gunfire from Israeli forces on a small group of journalists covering an expected raid by Israel's military. The Israeli military issued condolences for Abu Aqleh's death but has also maintained that its troops were returning fire at the scene and that the journalist may have actually been cut down by shots from Palestinian forces. When she was killed, Abu Aqleh, 51, wore a helmet and body armor clearly marked 'press', according to video footage of her slaying.", "5401c7d811299a972032763a356a028238a9acfcd25535ec9ee43357": "", "98f523ecb3e3e933504ad88ffb04a11424783792bd32f380f4847ef1": "", "0ea47ab99be607a3e7b3256962738b43e6c392a4034211caf94fa303": "", "68097609abd6d770620d746ecef0ccc5e49f5cd2af04a220b18850ec": "Coleen Rooney has been told she cannot provide 'one shred of evidence' that Rebekah Vardy leaked stories from a private Instagram account to the Sun - but insisted she has strong reason to 'believe' Vardy was responsible based on circumstantial clues. Rooney told the 'Wagatha Christie' libel trial that leaks from her private Instagram account to the Sun caused issues when she was dealing with difficulties in her marriage to former footballer Wayne Rooney. She said one private Instagram post in 2017 made its way to the tabloid at a time she and Rooney were 'trying to figure out our relationship' and were spending time apart, after he crashed his car while drink-driving with another woman in the vehicle. She said it was upsetting when the Sun learned of the private photo, which suggested the family were back together. 'I didn't know how my marriage was going to work out and whether I was going on with my relationship,' she told the high court in London. 'We needed to try and work things out.' Vardy's lawyer, Hugh Tomlinson QC, put it to Coleen Rooney that there was not 'a shred of evidence' that Vardy had leaked private Instagram material about the couple to the Sun. He suggested that another one of Rooney's 300-plus followers may have been responsible for passing information to journalists at the tabloid. Rooney said: 'It was someone who was on my Instagram account and I believe that it was Mrs Vardy.' Tomlinson replied: 'I didn't ask what you believe, I asked if you could be sure.' He repeatedly told Rooney that beliefs do not count as hard evidence: 'You might believe Derby County might win the Premiership in two years' time. It's not evidence is it?' Wayne Rooney, the Derby County manager, did not react when he heard the jibe about his football team, which have been recently relegated to League One - the third tier of English football - amid financial difficulties. Coleen Rooney is being sued for libel by fellow footballer's wife Vardy, who denies Rooney's public accusation that she passed stories from Rooney's Instagram account to the Sun newspaper. Vardy is married to the Leicester City striker, Jamie Vardy. Rooney insisted there was overwhelming evidence that Vardy's Instagram account was accessing the leaked material. 'I thought a lot about this,' she said. 'I've been in the public eye for 20 years. I've become quite savvy to the way people work and journalists work. I hate gossips, I'm not a gossip. It all added up to me that it came from this account.' She said she became 'really suspicious' that Vardy was leaking to the Sun because Vardy actively sought publicity for herself, had previously provided exclusives to the Sun and had exchanged unusual messages with Rooney. Early in 2019 Rooney blocked Vardy from viewing the account, only for Vardy to message her and ask for access to be restored. Rooney said this complaint made her even more suspicious that Vardy was responsible for the leaks - leading her to run a now-infamous sting operation in which Rooney posted fake updates in order to see which ended up as stories in the Sun. Under cross-examination, Rooney repeatedly detailed her strong dislike of the Sun newspaper and said her life 'has been picked apart by the media for the last 20 years'. In an early pretrial hearing a judge ruled that the true meaning of Rooney's 2019 public accusation that 'it's ......... Rebekah Vardy's account' was a direct allegation that Vardy herself had leaked to the Sun - rather than simply anyone with access to Vardy's account. As the person who made the accusation, it is up to Rooney to prove that her claim was truthful or in the public interest. For her part Vardy has argued that her agent, Caroline Watt, may have been leaking the material to the Sun without her knowledge. Although Vardy has acknowledged that her agent was discussing private information about Rooney with a Sun journalist, she has insisted that she was not the original source of any leaks. Rooney told the court that paparazzi take pictures of her 'most days' and that her life in the US, where she moved to be with her husband in 2018 while he played for DC United, had been miserable. She said she 'cried every night' while living overseas because she missed her family and the leak of a private Instagram story about a supposed car crash to the Sun made it harder. She told the court: 'I don't understand why the press are interested in most things - I wouldn't want to read the stuff they write about me because most of what they write about me is ridiculous.' Vardy's lawyer replied: 'That may be something we can agree on.' Earlier in the day Vardy finished being cross-examined after four days of evidence in which she was accused of habitually leaking information to the Sun, destroying evidence on purpose, and helping journalists obtain information about Rooney. Vardy said the experience of being cross-examined was 'exhausting' and 'intimidating'. But she stood by the decision to bring the case in order to restore her public reputation. 'I didn't do anything wrong and I want to clear my name, not just for me but for my family and my children,' she said. The trial continues.", "7bff73bdf0ace8e81d1884cbd7c8fe318c236b4107fb3492c7267759": "Canada's supreme court has ruled that defendants accused of violent crimes such as homicide and sexual assault can use self-induced extreme intoxication as a defense, striking down a federal law supported by women's advocacy groups. The supreme court said on Friday a law passed by parliament in 1995 that prohibits the defense was unconstitutional and violates the country's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 'Its impact on the principles of fundamental justice is disproportionate to its overarching public benefits. It should therefore be declared unconstitutional and of no force or effect,' writing for a unanimous supreme court, Justice Nicholas Kasirer said of the law. At issue was whether defendants accused of a violent crime in a criminal court can raise extreme intoxication - known as 'non-mental disorder automatism' - as a defense. In doing so, defendants can claim their actions were involuntary as a result of taking drugs or alcohol and, as a result, they cannot be held criminally responsible for their actions. Federal Justice Minister David Lametti said Ottawa was carefully reviewing the decision. 'It is critically important to emphasize that today's decision does not apply to the vast majority of cases involving a person who commits a criminal offence while intoxicated,' he said in a statement. The court said it is the law in Canada that intoxication short of automatism is not a defense for the kind of violent crime at issue. Canadian courts have been divided on the matter, while women's advocacy groups have said the law is needed to protect women and children as violence disproportionately affects them. Four out of every five victims of intimate partner violence were women and women were five times more likely to experience sexual assault in 2019, based on Canadian government data. The issue came before the supreme court last fall when justices heard arguments regarding the constitutionality of the statute as it pertained to three separate cases. In Friday's ruling, the court said a trial can be ordered in one of the cases while restoring an acquittal in another. The third case involved David Sullivan, who attempted suicide on 1 December 2013, by taking a prescription drug known to cause psychosis. In a psychotic state, he stabbed his mother, whom he thought was an alien. Sullivan was convicted of aggravated assault and assault with a weapon after the judge said he could not use an extreme intoxication defense. The court of appeals, however, found the extreme intoxication law unconstitutional and acquitted Sullivan on both counts. Prosecutors appealed the ruling to the supreme court, which upheld his acquittal in Friday's ruling. Kasirer wrote that there are other paths for parliament to achieve its goals to address extreme intoxicated violence. In 1994, the supreme court had ruled in favor of an extreme intoxication defense by a suspect who was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a wheelchair while he was drunk. In response to the supreme court's ruling, Canada's parliament passed a law which prohibited defendants from using extreme intoxication as a defense in violent crime cases.

The study is the first to identify a biochemical marker in the blood that is linked to the risk of Sids, sometimes called cot death, when an apparently healthy infant dies during their sleep. Although the test is not accurate enough to be used in newborn screening, it hints that abnormally low levels of a chemical linked to the brain's arousal system could be involved in causing these babies to die suddenly in their sleep. 'This is a very important observation,' said Prof Peter Fleming, of the University of Bristol, whose work is credited with preventing tens of thousands of UK baby deaths after the Back to Sleep campaign launched in the 1990s. 'If this is telling us something new about the mechanism, then that's very important.' The investigation was led by Dr Carmel Harrington, an honorary research fellow at the Children's hospital at Westmead, New South Wales, who lost her own son, Damien, to Sids 29 years ago. Harrington and colleagues compared dried blood samples taken during the newborn heel prick test from 655 healthy babies, 26 babies who died from Sids and 41 babies who died in infancy from other causes. They found that the Sids babies had lower levels of an enzyme called Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which plays a major role in the brain's arousal pathway. This could indicate an arousal deficit, which reduces an infant's ability to wake or respond to the external environment, such as overheating or a blanket over the face. This could cause vulnerability to Sids, the scientists said. 'Up to now we didn't know what was causing the lack of arousal,' said Harrington. 'Now that we know that BChE is involved we can begin to change the outcome for these babies and make Sids a thing of the past. 'An apparently healthy baby going to sleep and not waking up is every parent's nightmare and until now there was absolutely no way of knowing which infant would succumb.' However, at this stage testing for BChE wouldn't be helpful as a newborn screening tool. Although the Sids babies had lower levels on average, there was also a lot of overlap between the groups, with about half of the Sids babies falling within the same range as half of the babies who did not die. The biomarker was also not as powerful a predictor as some previously known environmental factors, such as smoking during pregnancy, which is linked to a more than threefold increase in Sids incidence. Babies with low BChE had a 1.1-1.5 times higher risk of Sids. 'The thing that worries me - and I've already had calls from bereaved families - is that at this stage it isn't usable by the individual,' said Fleming. 'It's useful at the population level.' The findings could help explain how smoking in pregnancy leads to biological changes that put babies at greater risk of Sids, for instance. 'It needs a lot more investigation,' said Fleming. Jenny Ward, the chief executive of the Lullaby Trust, said: 'The findings of this study are interesting and more work needs to be done. We look forward to seeing more as this research continues and hope that it helps us understand more about sudden infant death syndrome.' She added that it was important that the findings should not be viewed as a reason to downplay safer sleep advice, including 'always sleeping baby on their back in a clear sleep space on a flat, firm and waterproof mattress with no bulky bedding, pillows or cot bumpers.'

Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has just posted a video clip of an interview conducted with Rai 1 in Italy.

Kharkiv governor Oleh Synyehubov has provided an update on the situation in his region on Telegram, saying 'the night was relatively calm'.

He said that in Dergachi 'the Russians damaged the humanitarian headquarters, the registry office, part of the clinic, and the ambulance building', and that in Shebelinka 'a Russian shell hit a hangar building. The roof of the hangar and 10 trucks were on fire. Unfortunately, three people died and 5 others were injured.' He added: None of the claims have been independently verified. A quick snap from Reuters here that the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, has said this morning that the European Union would provide another EUR500m (PS425m) worth of military support to Ukraine, and that he was confident a deal could be reached in the coming days to agree an embargo on Russian oil. Here are some of the latest images we have been sent over the newswires showing the impact of the conflict in Ukraine and beyond. British foreign secretary Liz Truss said it was vital to keep up the pressure on Russia by supplying more weapons to Ukraine and imposing further sanctions. 'It is very important at this time that we keep up the pressure on Vladimir Putin by supplying more weapons to Ukraine and by increasing the sanctions,' Reuters reports she told the media on arrival at a G7 foreign ministers meeting in northern Germany. Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk, has issued a short update on Telegram this morning. He said that the Russians had 'made every effort to break through the defences in Luhansk region' and attempted to storm 'Rubizhne, Zolote, Nizhne, suburbs of Severodonetsk'. He suggested that the Russians were making another attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets, describing them as 'racists' and 'idiots'. He then said: The Russian embassy in Latvia has issued a strongly worded statement about the decision yesterday in Riga to suspend protections of Soviet monuments within its borders. The embassy says: Yesterday Latvia's parliament voted that protection of Soviet monuments would be suspended until Russian forces left Ukraine. MP Krista Baumane said the monuments were symbols of Russian occupation and of Russian crimes in Ukraine. A small number of lawmakers opposed the move, saying they were memorials for the victory over Nazism in the second world war, and nothing to do with the current conflict. The UK's ministry of defence has said the failed crossing of the Siverskyi Donets river by Russian forces in the Donbas showed the pressure Russian commanders were under: On Wednesday, Ukrainian forces successfully prevented the crossing, and released images which the MoD said indicated that Russia 'lost significant armoured manoeuvre elements of at least one Battalion Tactical Group'. The pictures showed what Ukraine claimed were destroyed Russian tanks and other armoury in the village of Bilohorivka, near the strategic Ukrainian-held city of Lysychansk. The UK's ministry of defence also said Russia was 'investing significant effort in the vicinity of Izium and Severodonetsk in an attempt to achieve a breakthrough towards Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.' The Ukrainian counteroffensive around the north-eastern city of Kharkiv is 'starting to look very similar to the counteroffensive that ultimately drove Russian troops away from Kyiv and out of western Ukraine entirely', the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest assessment of the conflict. It was 'forcing the Russian command to make hard choices', including by making Russian units focus their bombardments on attacking Ukrainian troops rather than the city, the US-based thinktank continued. Meanwhile, Russian forces may be abandoning their efforts to encircle Ukrainian troops along the Izyum-Slovyansk-Debaltseve line in eastern Ukraine in favour of shallower encirclements of the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk. However, it was 'unclear if Russian forces can encircle, let alone capture, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk even if they focus their efforts on that much-reduced objective', the institute said. However, the thinktank also noted Russian forces probably control almost all of the city of Rubizhne as of 12 May and have most likely seized the town of Voevodivka, north of Severodonetsk.  The report also noted that Russian forces were strengthening their position on Snake Island, in the Black Sea, in a bid to block Ukrainian maritime communications near they key port city of Odesa. Ukraine says it has damaged a Russian navy logistics ship near Snake Island, a small but strategic outpost in the Black Sea, Reuters reports. 'Thanks to the actions of our naval seamen, the support vessel Vsevolod Bobrov caught fire - it is one of the newest in the Russian fleet,' said Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration. Reuters could not independently verify the details. Russia's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Satellite imagery provided by Maxar, a private US-based company, showed the aftermath of what it said were probable missile attacks on a Russian Serna-class landing craft near the island, close to Ukraine's sea border with Romania. Images also showed recent damage to buildings on the island, which became famous for the foul-mouthed defiance of its Ukrainian defenders early in the invasion. Renewed fighting around Snake Island in recent days may become a battle for control of the western Black Sea coast, according to some defence officials, as Russian forces struggle to make headway in Ukraine's north and east. A court in Kyiv will hear the first war crime trial since the invasion began when a Russian soldier accused of murdering a 62-year-old civilian appears in the dock on Friday, the Guardian's Daniel Boffey reports. The defendant who will appear at Kyiv's district court is Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, who is currently in Ukrainian custody. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles had come under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead the unarmed man, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered 'to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders', according to prosecutors. Read on here:  International sanctions on Russia should remain in place until all its troops have left Ukraine, UK foreign secretary Liz Truss has told a meeting of her G7 counterparts in Germany according to the BBC. 'Putin is humiliating himself on the world stage. We must ensure he faces a defeat in Ukraine that denies him any benefit and ultimately constrains further aggression,' she said. She also said that Ukraine's allies should commit to more sanctions against Russia and that they should go 'further and faster' to support it in its war. 'The best long-term security for Ukraine will come from it being able to defend itself. That means providing Ukraine with a clear pathway to Nato-standard equipment,' she said. Truss has been accused of taking a risky approach to the war, one that could risk inflaming the situation further and endangering any peace talks or chances of de-escalation. Hello, this is Helen Livingstone bringing you the latest developments on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Here's a roundup of the latest:", "def20d86e2eb0e55aa048d9ecc6c2eff3ffef68a4d3d19fbaac21e21": "The first war crime trial since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine has opened in Kyiv in a watershed moment. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old Russian commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, allegedly killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka while fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine. Shysimarin, who has been held in Ukrainian custody, is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles came under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead a 62-year-old unarmed man who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered 'to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders', according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened 'dozens of metres' from the victim's house and was committed using an AK-74 rifle. A spokesperson for the prosecutor's office said before the trial opened: 'Prosecutors and investigators of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services] have collected enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder. For these actions, he faces 10 to 15 years in prison or life in prison.' Two other cases are likely to be heard in court within days including an in absentia trial of Mikhail Romanov, a Russian soldier accused of rape and murder. He is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region near Kyiv, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while 'threatening her and her underage child with violence and weapons'. The trial is another propaganda triumph for Kyiv, and comes as the number of crimes registered by Ukraine's general prosecutor surpassed 11,000 and Unicef reported that at least 100 children had been killed in the war in April alone. Elsewhere on the ground on Friday, Ukraine claimed that it had damaged a Russian navy logistics ship near Snake Island in the Black Sea. 'Thanks to the actions of our naval seamen, the support vessel Vsevolod Bobrov caught fire - it is one of the newest in the Russian fleet,' said Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration.

Renewed fighting around Snake Island in recent days may become a battle for control of the western Black Sea coast, according to some defence officials, as Russian forces struggle to make headway in Ukraine's north and east. Ukrainian forces are reported to have driven Russian troops out of the region around the second-largest city, Kharkiv. The Reuters news agency said its journalists had confirmed Ukraine was in control of territory stretching to the banks of the Siverskiy Donets river, around 40km (25 miles) east of Kharkiv. Regional authorities reported ongoing missile strikes around Poltava and shelling at Dergach, near Kharkiv, that killed two people. Russia's army said it struck Donetsk and Kharkiv on Thursday, killing more than 170 people and destroying Ukrainian drones and rockets. Fighting has continued in Ukraine's south and east. Ukraine's presidency said shelling continued throughout Lugansk - part of the Donbas region where Ukrainian forces are fighting Russian armour and Kremlin-backed separatists. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his Thursday night address to the nation that Russian forces had destroyed 570 health care facilities in the country, including 101 hospitals. 'What for? It's nonsense. It's barbarity.' In the north-eastern region of Chernihiv, three people were killed and 12 others wounded on Thursday in a strike on a school in Novgorod-Siversky, the emergency services said. Iryna Vereshchuk, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, said 'difficult talks' were under way over the evacuation of 38 seriously wounded troops from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. 'We have started a new round of negotiations around a road map for an [evacuation] operation. And we will start with those who are badly wounded,' she told 1+1 television.", "2644da15608629a8230eb26024f1b14170c3563e71b315f685faf7f6": "Ukrainians have repelled multiple attempts by the Russians to cross a strategically significant river in the Donbas, inflicting heavy losses in the process, according to local officials and British intelligence. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said Russian forces had been repulsed three times as they tried to cross the Siverskyi Donets River, 12 miles (20km) west of Severodonetsk, losing armour and bridging equipment. 'We have eliminated Russian speedboats and helicopters which they used to cover their attempts,' the governor added, while aerial photography showed destroyed pontoon bridges and armour by the riverbanks. Earlier on Friday, British defence intelligence said Russia had lost 'significant armoured manoeuvre elements' from a battalion tactical group - a formation with about 800 personnel at full strength - from the failed efforts. Russian attempts to gain territory in the Donbas are increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost town held by Ukrainian forces - and the Russian forces were trying to cross the river in an attempt to cut off the town. Ukraine's defence ministry tweeted pictures of a smashed pontoon bridge and destroyed armoured vehicles in Bilohorivka on Wednesday, describing them as showing victims of 'artillerymen of the 17th tank brigade'. The British assessment appeared to verify that, and quantify the level of loss - effectively the equipment strength of one battalion of up to 90 Russian units operating in and near Ukraine. Another open source analyst estimated 73 Russian pieces of equipment, including tanks and armoured vehicles, were destroyed, relying on aerial photography of the aftermath of the battle. 'Conducting river crossings in a contested environment is a highly risky manoeuvre and speaks to the pressure the Russian commanders are under to make progress in their operations in eastern Ukraine,' the British Ministry of Defence said on Friday morning. Russian forces in the Donbas have made incremental progress on the north side of the Siverskyi Donets, and are assessed to be in control of Rubizhne to the north-west of Severodonetsk by the Institute for the Study of War. Winning control of the town has taken Russian forces 'two to three weeks', western officials added, representing an incremental pace of advance by Moscow. 'Russian doctrine in this kind of conflict would have its forces moving at some 40km a day,' an official added. Nevertheless, despite suggestions by US intelligence officials earlier this week that the conflict had largely ground to a standstill, other observers still believe Severodonetsk is at risk, in what is set to be a crucial battle in the struggle for control of the Donbas. 'They will likely launch a ground offensive on or around Severodonetsk in the coming days,' the Institute for the Study of War said, but added it was 'unclear if Russian forces can encircle, let alone capture' Severodonetsk, as the impetus in the Russian effort in the Donbas region appeared generally to have faded. A Russian offensive further west, south of Izium, had stalled for several weeks and was appearing to lose momentum, the institute added. Izium is one of the few places where Russia had managed to cross the Siverskyi Donets, but its forces have been unable to advance from there. Further north, Ukrainian forces are reported to have driven Russian troops out of the region around the second-largest city, Kharkiv. Reuters said its journalists had confirmed Ukraine was in control of territory stretching to the banks of the Siverskyi Donets, about 25 miles east of Kharkiv. Western officials say they believe Russia will form a defensive line behind the river there, partly to protect its supply lines to forces trying to make headway further south. 'This a staged and gradual withdrawal from Kharkiv,' one said, which would allow the Russian invaders to 'replenish and circulate their forces'. Elsewhere, Ukraine claimed it had damaged a Russian navy logistics ship near Snake Island in the Black Sea - which is still being fought over. Satellite imagery provided by Maxar, a private US-based company, showed the aftermath of what it said were probable missile attacks on a Russian Serna-class landing craft near the island, close to Ukraine's sea border with Romania. Renewed fighting around Snake Island in recent days may become a battle for control of the western Black Sea coast. Russia wants to maintain air defences on the island to protect its maritime operations - while for Ukraine the struggle has become symbolic, western officials added. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for the first time since the start of the war, urging Moscow to reach a ceasefire agreement and raising concern about international food supplies that have been disrupted by the fighting, according to Berlin's account of the 75-minute call. Meanwhile, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned the French leader, Emmanuel Macron, was trying 'in vain' to have a constructive dialogue with Putin, in an interview with Italian television - suggesting there was little appetite in Kyiv for a cessation of fighting at the moment. 'We must not look for a way out for Russia,' Zelenskiy said - although the Elysee Palace said Macron had 'never discussed anything with Vladimir Putin without the agreement of President Zelenskiy'.", "3b8bd5c23c4d65a9b35754a1521daa0e3b11b8cdd85a3239341c75ea": "", "66a221ad5b823d7cfb0463902ce7a9238c5002081040ab354a6f5536": "A Rwandan man has been arrested in the Netherlands based on an extradition request from Rwanda on suspicion that he was involved in the African country's 1994 genocide, Dutch prosecutors have said. The 65-year-old man, who was not identified, has been living in the Netherlands since he was granted asylum there in 1999. He was arrested on Wednesday in the town of Ermelo, 44 miles east of Amsterdam. 'In 1994, the man was an officer of the gendarmerie in Rwanda. According to the Rwandan authorities, he played a prominent role in the massacres committed in the Rwandan capital of Kigali and the municipality of Mugina,' the prosecutors said in a statement. The mass killing of Rwanda's Tutsi population was ignited on 6 April 1994, when a plane carrying the then president, Juvenal Habyarimana, was shot down and crashed in Kigali, the capital, killing the leader who, like most Rwandans, was an ethnic Hutu. The Tutsis were blamed for downing the plane, and although they denied it, bands of Hutu extremists began killing them, including children, with support from the army, police and militias. An estimated 30,000 civilians are said to have been killed during the Mugina parish massacre. Dutch prosecutors said that, according to the Rwandan authorities, the officer was closely involved in the planning and execution of the massacres in Mugina, including by supplying weapons to militias that killed Tutsi refugees. The man received Dutch citizenship in 2013 but immigration authorities sought to revoke it in court after the allegations against him came to light. He was arrested after his final appeal was exhausted on Wednesday.", "edd5c9b0c3b3e1d779cb17fe35c0cd227a2fa5ad253e36a4f8a72685": "The massive and deadly floods that struck South Africa in April were made twice as likely and more intense by global heating, scientists have calculated. The research demonstrates that the climate emergency is resulting in devastation. Catastrophic floods and landslides hit the South African provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape on 11 April following exceptionally heavy rainfall. The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa called the floods a 'catastrophe of enormous proportions' and 'the biggest tragedy we have ever seen', later declaring a national state of disaster. At least 453 people were killed and the port of Durban, the largest in Africa, was closed, causing global disruption in the supply of food and minerals. Other recent studies found that the heatwave in the Pacific Northwest region of North America in 2021 would have been 'virtually impossible' without climate change, and that global heating exacerbated the extreme floods in Europe in July 2021 and the storms in Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique in January. 'If we do not reduce emissions and keep global temperatures below 1.5C, many extreme weather events will become increasingly destructive,' said Dr Izidine Pinto, at the University of Cape Town and part of the team that conducted the analysis. 'We need to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to a new reality where floods and heatwaves are more intense and damaging.' Dr Friederike Otto, at Imperial College London and also part of the team, said: 'Most people who died in the floods lived in informal settlements, so again we are seeing how climate change disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable people. However, the flooding of the port of Durban is also a reminder that there are no borders for climate impacts. What happens in one place can have substantial consequences elsewhere.' A brutal heatwave is being endured in India and Pakistan and is certain to have been made worse by global heating. 'There is no doubt that climate change is a huge game changer when it comes to extreme heat,' said Otto. 'Every heatwave in the world is now made stronger and more likely to happen because of human-caused climate change.' Nick Silkstone, at the UK Met Office, said: 'Temperatures are expected to peak on Saturday, when maximum values could reach around 49-50C [120-122F] in the hottest locations, such as Jacobabad, and the Sibi area of Pakistan. These values are around 5-7C above average for the time of year.' The analysis of the role of global heating in the South African floods used weather data and computer simulations to assess how likely the extreme rainfall was to happen in today's heated climate - 1.2C hotter than before the industrial age - and in the unheated climate of the past. The results showed such extreme rainfall could now be expected about once every 20 years compared with only once every 40 years in the past, meaning it has become twice as likely. The assessment also showed the rainfall was 4-8% more intense than it would have been without climate change. This is consistent with scientific understanding of how climate change influences heavy rainfall. As the atmosphere becomes warmer it can hold more water, increasing the risk of downpours.", "8d11abc419742caf7c8adf1ff1eca554eede994f57d3281f21d25790": "Two US patients have recovered from intractable infections after being treated with a pioneering therapy involving genetically engineered bacteria-killing viruses. The cases raise hopes that so-called phage therapy could be used more widely to combat the global crisis of drug-resistant infections. One of the patients, Jarrod Johnson, a 26-year-old man with cystic fibrosis, was approaching death after suffering a chronic lung infection that resisted treatment by antibiotics for six years. After being given the phage therapy, his infection cleared allowing him to receive a lung transplant and resume an active life. 'I am so grateful for the effort, persistence and creativity of all the people who were involved in my treatment,' said Johnson, who lives in Denver. 'I thought I was going to die. They have literally saved my life.' The other patient, a 56-year-old man with severe arthritis, showed a remarkable recovery from a skin infection that was taking hold of his body and which had proved untreatable with conventional drugs. The team, who also developed the breakthrough treatment of a British teenager four years ago, say these latest cases will pave the way for a clinical trial of phage therapy, which could launch as soon as next year. 'These two reports really provide substantial encouragement for phage treatments for patients where antibiotics not only fail to control the infections, but also contribute substantial toxicity,' said Prof Graham Hatfull, whose team at the University of Pittsburgh developed the therapies. Prof Martha Clokie, a microbiologist at the University of Leicester who was not involved in the work, said: 'There is a growing feeling within the clinical community ... that phages could be part of the solution for patients, especially with those that really at the moment have no other alternative option. The overall need for alternatives for antibiotics is huge.' In 2019, 1.2 million people are estimated to have died globally as a direct cause of antimicrobial resistant infections and in about 5 million people, a multi-drug-resistant infection contributed to their death. Bacteriophages, phages for short, are harmless viruses that are natural enemies of bacteria. Hatfull has spent nearly four decades amassing a collection of phages, stored in 20,000 frozen vials in his lab. 'We've got a large collection of phages, and we've sequenced over 4,000 of their genomes, so we understand their genomic profiles and relationships in exquisite detail,' he said. Since the 2019 British case, the team has been inundated with requests from doctors who had run out of treatment options for patients. 'That's when the floodgates opened,' said Dr Rebekah Dedrick, a research associate in Hatfull's lab. 'We started to get requests from around the world, and we still get them.' One of these was Dr Jerry Nick, director of the adult cystic fibrosis programme at National Jewish Health in Denver. His patient, Jarrod, has cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that results in frequent infections clogging up the lungs with mucus. By 2020, his lungs had less than a third of their normal function and he had been plagued by a stubborn bacterial strains for six years. He was rejected for a lung transplant due to the high risk of the infection spreading once he was on immunosuppressant drugs. 'In the year before the operation, he was admitted to hospital 11 times and for 200 days in total,' said Nick. 'He was approaching death and probably had a year left.' In 2016, Nick and his colleagues had sent samples of the Mycobacterium abscessus from Johnson's lungs to Hatfull's lab in the hope of finding a phage that could eliminate it. But phages are often specific for only a few types of bacteria so Hatfull and his team screened dozens of candidates before finally identifying two that efficiently killed the bacteria. They then genetically engineered the phages to boost their efficiency. Johnson was treated with a combination of the phages and antibiotics for just over a year, requiring two daily intravenous injections, which cleared the infection, allowing him to have a lung transplant. His body developed some antibodies against the phages, but this happened slowly enough that the phages were able to get rid of the bacteria, quicker than the antibodies killed off the phage. Since treatment, Johnson has finished high school, been working, met a girlfriend and although he has had some complications from the transplant, overall Nick says he is doing well. The second patient, the 56-year-old man with arthritis, developed a serious skin infection, which is a risk among those on immunosuppressive drugs. He was treated with a single phage, called Muddy, which had been discovered in a sample taken from the underside of a decomposed aubergine. After a few weeks his skin lesions cleared and after two months he tested negative for the bacteria on a biopsy. He was treated for more than eight months in total. The cases are described in the journals Cell and Nature Communications.", "64aef93149dde5965c77704c5b5d329d26483368e1cf05b65c241c68": "", "386e3415ab51f27f82355ab286311ee1a58e13b09e64dc251ee93080": "From radio stations in Islamabad to the nightclubs of Delhi and house parties in Kathmandu, it is a song that in recent months has been impossible to avoid. As soon as the distinctive opening claps of Pasoori, by the Pakistani singer Ali Sethi and his collaborator Shae Gill, are heard, it is often greeted with a roar of approval. And it is not just in south Asia: since it was released in February, the song, which draws on traditional and modern musical influences, has gone on to become a global phenomenon and one of Pakistan's most popular musical exports for years. It has more than 111m views on YouTube, it was the first Pakistani song to top Spotify's global viral charts, and the first Pakistani song to enter its official global songs chart. Sethi, a classically trained musician as well as a singer, composer and fiction author, has grown to be one of Pakistan's most popular pop stars, though having lived in the US for the past five years he has said he sees himself more as a 'diasporic voice'. The song has been heralded for transcending boundaries, particularly between India and Pakistan, continuing a long tradition of culture uniting the two countries where politics always failed. In India, Pakistani soaps are among the most popular television shows, while people in Pakistan avidly consume Bollywood films and music. Pasoori, which roughly translates as 'difficulty', came from Sethi's encounters with the often unsurmountable walls that exist between India and Pakistan, which stopped him from being able to visit and perform in India. The lyrics draw on the age-old story of forbidden love, and are written in Punjabi, a language spoken in both India and Pakistan. 'It's been a theme running in my life for several years; I've had to engage with my Indian fans and friends through veils, lest we draw the attention of extremist elements whose job is to maintain the rigid boundary between India and Pakistan,' Sethi said. 'So I'd been mulling the theme of prohibition for many months.' He emphasised that the classical and folk traditions on which the song draws, including the Sufi traditions of Qawwali music, had come about long before partition and so could not be codified as either Indian or Pakistani, and had centuries-long roots on both sides of the border. He said he had wanted to write a song that 'felt classical but also relevant to contemporary life', but admitted he had no idea it would become so popular across the region. The song has also become a victim of its own success. Many have pointed out that Sethi's privilege - he is from an elite, educated family in Lahore, was educated at Harvard and now lives in New York - has given him and his music a platform not afforded to many other Pakistan artists. Rafay Mahmood, a writer on south Asian music, said: 'We have a number of very well-versed, young and trained classical singers but they can't access the Gen Z marker which Ali can do, due to their lack of cosmopolitan exposure and in some cases education.' However, Mahmood said the song was to be celebrated for Sethi 'finding his own voice' and for successfully weaving in traditional south Asian musical motifs with popular electronic dance beats. 'Pakistani songs have travelled across the border and it is not the first time,' he added. 'Pasoori is not a statement or a political anthem. It is a well-produced, catchy song. Nothing else, nothing more.' Pasoori was released through Coke Studios, an influential Pakistani television programme and musical franchise, which since 2008 has invited some of the country's most popular and respected musicians to write tracks and perform them live. The songs that have come out of Coke Studios are consumed as much by Indian listeners as Pakistani, and the franchise has played a crucial role in bringing Pakistani music to international audiences. Sethi has performed on five Coke Studios series since 2015, and Pasoori is his biggest hit from it yet. Zulfiqar Jabbar Khan, known as Xulfi, the producer and curator of this recent season of Coke Studio, said the moment he had heard Pasoori 'I felt the excitement rushing through me. I told him [Sethi] that when people will listen to this, they won't know what hit them and that this song has the capability to go global.' Xulfi said the popularity of Pasoori had 'opened the global door of love' towards Pakistani pop music and 'the opportunity to frequent the charts has opened up too'. 'In all honesty, I am very excited for the future because I know Pakistan has the ability to surprise the world,' he said. 'And to make sure we keep doing that, we need to keep conveying our progressive and artistic side to the world.'", "4bb1f8a61bca59ad19ba64634f8eff4627a92a77faf579a9904a905b": "", "57a02b71a652509ac2dbdb005a8893836fe08df1ffcc6a238e203cd5": "", "8f4e100ead323c0a4f5070d2d8c7d417d444d9825553baba5f778f73": "", "3d8833efc18e2adae176ac9292d715d79e046b79bed448aa0abcce21": "", "46edbaf8c523de539d0a852c8b533f822a1895494998a023d7270a36": "", "305bac23ab30900d87e8c01b0a8252c4fa9f91278d448108fdbbcf05": "", "831f7ffb318d3745e7c3f2418b55f7bc461d45612f47a9cec2dee30d": "", "03ddec4f8ad85c47044ac661f173a47fbac91c941faad304d3fdfa63": "", "f00c6075ec76fdd387bbd687c56f8fd1900e10f9a3a0486fe9c33944": "", "96c85fe81e765403ee445903a398f12ce08a0b4d9dcbeb7814835da0": "", "21ebb5ee0fc50a28e70013d6c0225305d8377d0fe4b0bae2fca1f9e1": "", "9167f204742441e62314716b5a7642a4bc9dbb02e9cd9168b2af8721": "Torrential rain has been hitting eastern Australia since Monday, with rainfall totals on the north-east coast widely achieving in excess of 100mm. In Yabulu, north of Townsville, there was major flooding on Tuesday as 196mm of rain fell within 24 hours. This was not the highest total recorded, however, with 244mm of rain falling on Tuesday at Mourilyan, near Innisfail on the Cassowary Coast. The threat of heavy rain sank south across Queensland to the south-east, reaching Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast on Wednesday; stations in the south-east recorded up to 100mm, with a station in Dayboro recording 161mm. A further 100-150mm of rain fell on Friday across the south-east. Communities in the Black Mountain region, Noosa, south-east Queensland, have become cut off as a consequence of flash flooding blocking roads, with alternative routes destroyed by a landslide during late February's heavy rains. Road and school closures have littered Queensland and one woman died on Wednesday after having been swept away in a car in flash floods north of Mackay. River catchments have been inundated and the soils saturated after multiple heavy rain events over the past few months, with swollen rivers and dams full to bursting. Monthly rainfall totals from all this look as if they will be more than three times higher than the monthly average widely across Queensland and northern New South Wales. The recent La Nina event strengthening the easterly winds across the equator has been driving these torrential rains, as increased moisture is fed in from the Pacific for these events. Meanwhile, on Sunday, the tropical cyclones Asani and Karim were seen mirroring each other either side of the equator on satellite imagery. The cyclones developed in the Indian Ocean, with Asani sitting north of the equator to the east of India rotating anticlockwise, while Karim spun clockwise to the south. These differences in rotation are governed by the Coriolis force - this driving northern hemisphere winds to deflect to the right, and southern hemisphere winds deflecting to the left due to the Earth's rotation. Asani gave some relief to eastern parts of India, which is in the grips of a heatwave, as cloud and rain reached eastern coasts on Wednesday. However, temperatures still reached a sweltering 46C (114.8F) in Gujarat, north-west India, on the same day.", "8d6340f75b2950a660238b7bf6f021b78b6d76b105a089a66f59609e": "Every day, for the past 20 years, Joyce Naserian has laid out her handmade curios near an entrance to the Masai Mara park to sell to passing tourists. Her earnings have helped the 46-year-old feed and educate all four of her children.  In northern Kenya, about 1,200 semi-nomadic women earned more than 9m Kenyan shillings (PS62,000) selling beadwork to visitors at 43 community wildlife conservancies in 2020. Just as it was Naserian in the Mara, selling the beadwork was a solid money earner for these women. But that was before Covid. The collapse of eco-tourism during the pandemic has spelled disaster for conservation initiatives and livelihoods in Kenya and beyond. Cuts to budgets and staff, reduced salaries and stalled development and education projects have plunged communities into poverty, leading to a rise in poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. Reuters reported that in the first three months of 2020, the African continent lost $55bn (PS44bn) in travel and tourism revenues - funds that go towards running conservation programmes that benefit local communities. Kenya's government has relaxed a raft of travel restrictions, but the return of international tourists has been slow, while concerns about carbon emissions from long-haul air travel may be putting people off flying into conservation areas. 'It is a real struggle for survival,' says Daniel Sopia, head of Masai Mara Wildlife Conservancies Association. 'Women who relied solely on beadwork were badly affected as there was not a single tourist coming to the Mara at the height of Covid-19 restrictions. Household income dropped significantly and they had to rely on food from well-wishers.' The 15 wildlife conservancies that Sopia heads comprise individual blocks of land owned by Maasai people. The landowners lease the land, covering 14,0426 hectares (347,000 acres), to safari camps and lodges, which pay fees that fund projects providing water, healthcare and education, as well as setting up small businesses. In return, the 14,500 landowners protect biodiversity within the Mara ecosystem while preserving their traditional lifestyle. Four years before the pandemic, the conservancies contributed almost 120m Kenyan shillings to social programmes in the region. Two years ago, payments to landowners fell by 50%, forcing conservancies to scale back operations and focus on priorities such as allowances to wildlife rangers. Sopia and his team had to scramble to prevent the total collapse of conservation programmes. 'Conservancies remained operational throughout the pandemic despite the lack in tourism income,' says Sopia. 'We were fortunate to mobilise some resources from development partners and private foundations. These helped to cover rangers' salaries, food rations, fuel, and vehicle maintenance. 'We hope the arrangement will be in place till June 2022 as we slowly wean the conservancies off such aid,' he says. Some foreign organisations are now making a comeback after a two-year hiatus. In March 2022, UK charity Tusk brought together conservation professionals from across Africa for a symposium in Masai Mara to help organisations diversify fundraising and build resilient units. Since 1990, Tusk has raised more than PS80m towards conservation projects across more than 20 African countries and helped to protect more than 40 threatened species. Tusk's upcoming Wildlife Ranger Challenge seeks to raise money for rangers whose pay was slashed in the pandemic. 'The last two years have been extremely tough for everyone. The conservation sector in particular has had to endure huge losses, dramatic cutbacks in operating budgets, and, sadly, redundancies,' says Charlie Mayhew, Tusk Trust chief executive. Wanjiku Kinuthia, strategyhead at Maliasili, hopes the renewed interest in broadening discussions about African conservation will boost small organisations that are often left out of big decisions, despite being closest to the vulnerable communities bearing the brunt of a collapsing environment. 'They often miss out on global dialogues,' says Kinuthia, whose group supports about 20 other organisations in seven countries, including smaller ones that lack the networks to make their voices heard. 'They do not understand how the media works or how to tell their stories. We can be catalysts of change for such grassroots organisations.' Involving communities in conservation would safeguard the 65% of wildlife that lives outside protected areas, she says. 'All people need are tools to help them coexist with animals in the 21st century while benefiting from conservation.' However, some conservationists say the only way to sustain conservation programmes and avoid disruption is by governments increasing budgets to the sector, a challenge considering the current low levels of state investment. Dickson Kaelo, who heads the Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association, says African countries depend on foreign donors to fund development and conservation is no exception. 'There is no single answer to cutting off foreign aid,' says Kaelo. 'There are no government incentives for setting up a conservancy to protect an elephant that walks all over destroying life and property. 'If you are in the farming sector, you can get a loan to buy a tractor, but there is no institution that gives loans for those who want to invest in protecting wildlife, and while a person buying a vehicle to ferry tourists gets some tax rebates, we get no such benefits when buying a truck for wildlife rangers.' He adds: 'The government is creating laws that hamper conservation, including the Natural Resources (Benefits Sharing) Bill, with a formula that will see those in conservation give 80% of their proceeds to government and a paltry 12.8% to local communities. In addition, the government requires that you come up with a management plan, a strategic and environmental study, multiple registration procedures and other permits before setting up a private conservancy. If you want to lease land you have to pay 2% stamp duty for the entire period, say for 20 years, and pay that upfront. Why don't we see such laws when someone wants to cut down a tree?' Kaddu Sebunya, chief executive at the African Wildlife Foundation says Africans must be exposed to the benefits of wildlife and wild lands so they can lead on conservation. A starting point would be to make tourism more accessible, he says, 'as it is easier for someone in New York or Sydney to book a tour to Africa than someone living in Harare or Lagos.'. 'Building our domestic and regional tourism market will be a stepping stone to increasing the African voice for conservation. While millions of Africans traverse the continent to travel for business, how can these numbers be translated to nature tourists? 'Data from Unctad [UN Conference on Trade and Development] indicates that four out of 10 international tourists in Africa come from the continent, and this begs the question, 'is our product marketing catering to the four Africans?' It is high time for a shift in mindset,' says Sebunya.

The getaway happened as officers bussed Gonzalo Lopez, 46, and other inmates through a rural area between Houston and Dallas about 1.20pm. Lopez somehow slipped out of his shackles, used an unspecified sharp object to stab the driver in the hand and lunged for the wounded officer's service pistol, Robert Hurst of the Texas department of criminal justice told reporters. The driver blocked Lopez from taking the gun but couldn't stop him from jumping out of the bus, Hurst said. A second guard aboard the bus fired both a pistol and a shotgun at Lopez, but it wasn't clear whether any of the blasts hit the prisoner, who was last seen fleeing across a nearby cow pasture. Fifteen other prisoners on the bus did not try to make a run for it, Hurst added. Hurst also said the wounded guard's stabbing is not considered life-threatening. Lopez remained at large on Friday afternoon, more than a day later, and authorities were publicly offering $15,000 for information leading to his capture. More than 300 law enforcement officers from local, state and federal agencies were scouring the area around the community of Centerville for signs of Lopez, who investigators suspect could be hiding in any of the creek beds or brush patches in the dry, hot region, according to Hurst. An airplane crew was assisting search efforts. Lopez was ordered to serve the rest of his life in prison after he shot at a sheriff's office deputy in 2004 and killed a man with a pickaxe after holding him for ransom over a drug deal gone awry near Texas' border with Mexico, according to officials. He was most recently being housed at a corrections facility in Gatesville, more than 100 miles from where the search for Lopez was focused. 'I cannot reiterate enough how dangerous this guy is,' Hurst told media gathered near the search perimeter Friday. Lopez's escape drew comparisons from some to a 2019 case also in Texas in which a mixed martial arts fighter accused of killing two people fled from an inmate transport van. Authorities said they eventually captured that escaper, Cedric 'Spiderman' Marks, nine hours later as he unsuccessfully tried to hide in a trash can.", "61988e9f583a88b70018e67130b2e20da6f0e096f8f81fb3dd6de168": "The US justice department secretly issued a subpoena to gain access to details of the phone account of a Guardian reporter as part of an aggressive leak investigation into media stories about an official inquiry into the Trump administration's child separation policy at the southern border. Leak investigators issued the subpoena to obtain the phone number of Stephanie Kirchgaessner, the Guardian's investigations correspondent in Washington. The move was carried out without notifying the newspaper or its reporter, as part of an attempt to ferret out the source of media articles about a review into family separation conducted by the Department of Justice's inspector general, Michael Horowitz. It is highly unusual for US government officials to obtain a journalist's phone details in this way, especially when no national security or classified information is involved. The move was all the more surprising in that it came from the DoJ's inspector general's office - the watchdog responsible for ethical oversight and whistleblower protections. Katharine Viner, the Guardian's editor-in-chief, decried the action as 'an egregious example of infringement on press freedom and public interest journalism by the US Department of Justice'. She added: 'We will be asking the DoJ urgently for an explanation for why and how this could have occurred, and for an apology. We will also be seeking assurances that our reporter's details will be erased from DoJ systems and will not be used for any further infringements of press freedom.' The leak inquiry was conducted on behalf of the DoJ by the inspector general's office of an outside government department, housing and urban development (Hud). Its investigation focused on allegations that an employee within the DoJ's inspector general's office had leaked sensitive information to three news outlets - the Guardian, the New York Times and NBC News. The Guardian was the only one of the three outlets to have a subpoena issued relating to its reporter's phone account. The Guardian published two sensitive reports by Kirchgaessner within the timeframe of the DoJ review into child separation covered by the leak inquiry. On 23 July 2020 she revealed that the DoJ's former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein had personally advised that migrant parents should be prosecuted, no matter how young the children accompanying them. On 2 September 2020, Kirchgaessner reported that a senior justice department official nominated by Trump to be a federal judge had participated in the removal of a Texas prosecutor who had sounded the alarm over child separation. On Thursday, the investigative reporter Jason Leopold released a redacted version of the Hud leak inquiry report obtained under freedom of information laws. It revealed that leak investigators had reviewed evidence of 127 phone calls totalling about six hours in length with 'phone numbers identified as belonging to reporter Stephanie Kirchgaessner of the Guardian', and an additional 126 phone calls about six hours and 20 minutes 'with a phone number identified as belonging to the Guardian generally'. The leak report also discloses that the DoJ issued an 'administrative subpoena' to a telecommunications company for 'subscriber information to confirm that a specific telephone number belonged to the Guardian'. It said that 'basic subscriber information' had been obtained involving 'names, addresses, and length of service only' and 'not the contents of communications'. Child separation was effected in 2018 under the Trump administration. Known officially as 'zero tolerance', the policy ordered federal prosecutors to act against undocumented immigrants entering the US unlawfully even when minors were present - a reversal of previous practice which had spared families from criminal proceedings in order to avoid children being separated from their parents. The policy led to more than 3,000 children being separated from their parent or guardian, and to widespread chaos in which the location of many children became unknown. The much-delayed DoJ inspector general's report into the practice was finally published after two years, in January 2021. Earlier this week Politico reported that an employee of the DoJ inspector general's office had 'abruptly resigned' after coming under scrutiny from the leak investigation.", "35401cc5bec5a57c9d993bd616e7a2976ba54ca5d94267f372bc79ac": "Extreme conditions have fueled an explosive start to what's expected to be yet another intense season of big blazes, with months to go before wildfire threats typically peak across the west. Wildfires have charred close to 1.3m acres nationwide this year, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), outpacing the 10-year average for this time of year by more than 71%. Predictions for the rest of the spring do not bode well for the west, with the drought and warmer weather brought on by the climate crisis worsening wildfire danger. 'We all know it's really early for our fire season and we're all in awe of what we've already experienced,' said Dave Bales, commander on a New Mexico fire that is the largest burning in the US. From a California hilltop where mansions with multimillion-dollar Pacific Ocean views were torched to remote New Mexico mountains burned by a month-old monster blaze, similar conditions set the stage for the fires, which fire crews are still fighting to contain. Exacerbated by the climate crisis, rising temperatures spurred dryness, turning parched vegetation into fuel. Gusty winds have complicated firefights, carrying embers and fanning the flames through the drought-stricken region. As the unstoppable northern New Mexico wildfire chewed through more dense forest on Thursday, firefighters in the coastal community of Laguna Niguel doused charred and smoldering remains of 20 large homes that quickly went up in flames and forced a frantic evacuation. 'The sky, everything was orange. It looked like an inferno, so we just jumped in the car,' Sassan Darian said, as he recounted fleeing with his daughter and father while embers swirled around them. 'My daughter said, 'We're on fire.' There were sparks on her and we were patting ourselves down.' Fire officials said there was not much they could do in recent days to stop the fast-moving flames burning in tinder-dry forests in the Sangre de Christo range. Fueled by overgrown mountainsides covered with ponderosa pine and other trees sucked dry of moisture over decades, the fire had burned across more than 270,440 acres - an area bigger than the city of Dallas, Texas - by Friday morning and was 30% contained. Crews fighting flames along the mountain fronts between Santa Fe and Taos mostly held their own on Thursday thanks to welcome help from aerial attacks. But fire operations chief Todd Abel said that in some places where winds were gusting over ridgetops, it was 'almost like putting a hair dryer on it'. Even small fires that once would have been easily contained are extreme threats to life and property because of climate breakdown, said Brian Fennessy, chief of the Orange county fire authority. The fire that broke out in southern California on Wednesday afternoon, which may have been sparked by electric utility equipment, was pushed up a canyon by strong sea breezes and quickly ignited large homes. It burned a relatively small area, about 200 acres (81 hectares), and was at 15% containment on Friday but had left a path of destruction. The weather wasn't unusual that day in Orange county, with mild temperatures, offshore breezes and high humidity. But the ignition on a steep slope covered in dried vegetation enabled the disaster to develop quickly. 'What we're seeing that we haven't seen in years past is these fires are starting and the vegetation is so dry that with any wind behind it -- even a normal wind for that area -- it's going to spread faster than we're used to and faster than we can get our units at the scene,' Fennessy told the Los Angeles Times. Many of the homes claimed by the flames were built before fire-protective building codes, making them more vulnerable to embers. A sprawling estate selling for $9.9m had looked in real estate listings like a California dream: teeming with luxuries that included a two-level library, a 'wellness wing' with sauna and steam room and a pool on a terrace overlooking scenic Laguna Beach. By nightfall, the mansion once photographed against a pastel sunset had morphed into a nightmare: its arched facade silhouetted against a glowing yellow sky as firefighters trained their hoses on the engulfed structure. After the big flames died down on Thursday, the house was one of many smoking casualties marked off with yellow tape. In another driveway, a burned-out car rested on its rims. The steep surrounding hillsides were blackened and stripped of vegetation. Many other homes appeared unscathed and palm trees that had survived the onslaught of embers swayed above in calmer winds. Two firefighters were hospitalized but no other injuries were reported. The fire's cause is under investigation and damage inspections were still ongoing on Thursday, TJ McGovern, assistant chief of Orange county fire authority, said. Southern California Edison reported that unspecified electrical 'circuit activity' occurred around the time the fire broke out late Wednesday afternoon. Electric utility equipment has repeatedly been linked to starting some of the most disastrous California wildfires, especially during windy weather. The state Public Utilities Commission last year approved a settlement of more than half a billion dollars in fines and penalties for SoCal Edison for its role in five wildfires in 2017 and 2018. In New Mexico, another red-flag warning was expected to end by Friday night for the first time in a week but extremely low humidity and bone-dry fuels will continue to provide ample opportunity for flames to spread, officials said. 'This fire is going to continue to grow,' Bales, the incident commander, warned on Thursday night. The blaze has burned more than 170 homes so far, but authorities have said that number is expected to increase significantly as more assessments are done and residents are allowed to return home to areas deemed safe. The coming months are not likely to offer a reprieve from conditions that favor fires, and several western states are bracing for the hot, dry summer and autumn months. The south-west is forecast to have above normal significant fire potential through June, when fires have historically been the worst for the region. Oregon and the Pacific north-west will start to see the risks rise in July, and California, particularly in the northern part of the state, will face increased threats throughout the summer, according to the NIFC's latest outlook report. 'Build-up of fuels such as dead trees and brush combines with drought to create a tinderbox ready to burn,' the NIFC wrote in an official update on Friday. The Associated Press contributed  reporting", "6fb725720ad47349c8f26c36803202d4232c95a0cd8a6bf3ef677e22": "Pro-choice demonstrators continue to turn up outside the homes of supreme court justices, with the latest target being conservative Amy Coney Barrett, who signed on to a majority draft opinion that was leaked to reveal an intention to overturn the constitutional right to seek an abortion in the US. 'The right to your own body - to do what you want with your own body - is the most personal freedom you can have,' one protester said from among a group wearing long red 'handmaid' capes and white bonnets earlier this week to symbolize forced childbearing, as members of the Virginia state police watched nearby. Several organizations, led by Planned Parenthood and the Women's March, are preparing for a nationwide day of pro-choice marches on Saturday. Protests have been occurring intermittently since the 2 May leak of the draft opinion that sent shockwaves across America by indicating five of the nine justices favor overturning the landmark supreme court decision in Roe v Wade that paved the way for legal abortion across the US in 1973. Protesters have so far gathered outside the residences in the Washington DC area of Samuel Alito, who wrote the scorching draft opinion, and Brett Kavanaugh, as well as Barrett and the chief justice, John Roberts, who did not sign on to the draft opinion, unlike the other three and Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. The court's final decision on Roe, which is wrapped up in a pivotal Mississippi case before the court, Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health, is expected next month. Meanwhile Republican lawmakers are urging Merrick Garland, the US attorney general, to employ a 72-year-old federal law that outlaws demonstrating outside judges' residences. The protests, both outside the justices' houses and outside the supreme court, have been peaceful, with no known arrests, although new barriers have been erected to block off the sweeping marble steps and columns of the supreme court building. But there is a growing fear from pro-choice activists that women seeking abortion or even using abortion medication, and medical professionals, could be criminally charged if Roe is struck down and individual states can choose to ban the procedure. On Wednesday, Garland's office issued a statement saying: 'Attorney General Garland continues to be briefed on security matters related to the supreme court and supreme court justices. 'The attorney general directed the US marshals service to help ensure the justices' safety by providing additional support to the marshal of the supreme court and supreme court police.' It is against the law in Virginia to picket in residential areas. A source in the office of Virginia's Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, advised the Guardian that they are doing 'all they can' to provide security. Fairfax police sent a statement saying: 'Our civil disturbance unit (CDU) is trained to handle crowds that gather to express their views and are well versed on the laws that govern these planned gatherings. Our officers work to provide a safe space for individuals to exercise first amendment rights and also maintain community safety.' On Friday morning pro-choice House Democrats held a rally in Washington after the US Senate on Wednesday failed to pass legislation that would codify the rights provided by the landmark Roe case. 'People should continue to exercise their rights within the first amendment,' the House Democratic caucus chair, Hakeem Jeffries, told the Guardian when asked about activists protesting at the homes of members of the supreme court bench.", "49c65f5cbd0634b07c5c7a3003f5122c1d0c049608488ec0803814f5": "TerraUSD, the 'algorithmic stablecoin' whose collapse prompted a multibillion-dollar selloff across crypto markets, has turned off its blockchain and been delisted from major exchanges, in effect shuttering the project for good. However, the wider impact of the project's failure appears to have been constrained. TerraUSD was once valued at more than $40bn (PS33bn). Shockwaves swept through cryptocurrency markets on Thursday as tether, the largest stablecoin and a foundational part of the digital asset ecosystem, broke its peg to the dollar. On Friday, however, tether was back to within a fraction of a per cent of its $1 peg and has successfully processed more than $3bn worth of withdrawals without issue. Bitcoin and ethereum, the two most important cryptocurrencies, have recovered from their lows of early Thursday. Bitcoin is trading at above $30,000 a coin, up from $27,000, while Ethereum is at $2,000, up from $1,700. Both remain far below where they were trading at the start of the week. Terra's failure is likely to topple more dominoes, warned Fitch Ratings. 'The failure of Terra's peg has sent shocks through the decentralised finance sector, with a key saving and lending protocol, Anchor, seeing massive liquidation of UST-collateralised loans and the pricing of other crypto tokens also being affected,' the company said. 'This has led to further liquidation triggers throughout the ecosystem ... Bouts of volatility will probably continue as the crypto sector digests the repercussions of the failure of the UST peg.' Stablecoins are intended to maintain a fixed value, typically $1 a coin. But some, such as Terra, are 'algorithmic' stablecoins, which maintain that price through a promise to print or destroy currency to match demand. That approach has been criticised as sharing elements with a Ponzi scheme, requiring regular inflows of new capital to maintain the peg, and prone to a 'death spiral' if investors lose confidence. That death spiral has left Terra's two tokens effectively valueless. UST, the stablecoin, is now trading at under 20C/, far from its dollar peg; and Luna, the freely floating token that is supposed to provide the backing for the algorithmic stability, has fallen from $81 a coin seven days ago to $0.00004 a coin. The death spiral was worsened on Friday morning, when the key players behind Terra agreed to disable the blockchain that makes the system work, leaving the remaining holders unable to receive rewards for participation. At the same time, cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance and FTX moved to limit trading of the token, in an effort to protect naive investors from further losses. That was too late for some. The video game influencer KSI bought more than $3m worth of Luna on Tuesday, saying he had 'always been a risk taker... I saw an opportunity and I had to take it.' His holdings are now worth less than $10.  Despite the crash, the UK government says it aims to make stablecoins a legal part of the country's payments infrastructure. 'Our ambition is to make Britain a global hub for crypto-asset technology,' a Treasury spokesperson said , 'by creating a regulatory environment where firms can invest, innovate and scale up, while maintaining financial stability and regulatory standards to ensure people can use new technologies reliably and safely. 'We are delivering on this ambition - by consulting on a future regulatory regime for crypto-assets, legislating to bring stablecoins into payments regulation, and exploring ways of enhancing the competitiveness of the UK tax system to encourage further development of the crypto-asset market in the UK.'", "f45dfa5454daa09cfdef76424df5fe95312276875a6a646465b343d0": "", "c429e7346adcc5433f758db211bafb51af8898bce61ecb53727db208": "", "ad05edbe5d03e147f3ed62dd6e1a78ef6f62f35ddb0a875717b0c51f": "", "6e3966249507211ea93945b25c47448e70d41b7ea1f0e69c977a7e38": "", "4a6267721c08a786b1afbc78d5315bc740371e8b25d65251571437e1": "", "169d55e6df04e1052e65f50a20e1758e71ab2cc0f9d85cc7401c8f7d": "", "47d1c31de80cc1dc3d8133c2db30142f34205422ee09dc379afcb687": "", "0d3926b9913dbf7ad2fe87ed88f07da3a28c90cfe022e5e605824123": "", "b27510585e3a8c627520f97672a27fa96d1fbf0a641ee7cb6a5655da": "", "f905c3572cdb20e0228281f0f352771f75751159ef909313dc8d3fa6": "", "0a28fa7a7da8e5776d0ecb141834959c9443fbac71f071ca7897e247": "London will be 'rewilded' with new nature reserves, pocket parks and a mass community movement to bring nature back to the capital, the Guardian can reveal. A group of rewilding experts commissioned by the mayor, Sadiq Khan, are in the early stages of drawing up the proposal. The idea came from Ben Goldsmith, a financier and environment campaigner who is on the board of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The plan includes a selection of 'core rewilding areas' on the outskirts of London, which could involve turning parts of the Thames estuary into a wetland teeming with wading birds and other wildlife, and releasing beavers into the marshes around the periphery of the capital. Beavers have already been released in Enfield, to the delight of locals, and there are more set to be released in Ealing later this year. These will then be connected by 'nature corridors' that could run alongside train lines and on brownfield sites crisscrossing the city, which the wildlife could travel along. This would also create new wild green space for people to enjoy. The third prong of the plan is to involve Londoners, who will be encouraged to bring nature into their gardens, window boxes - and even on to their roofs. Shirley Rodrigues, the London deputy mayor for environment, said: 'In London there are differences in how people can access green space - this isn't just an environmental issue, it is a social justice issue. We have academics, practitioners, youth campaigners, all helping us with this project. People are massively excited about this - people were so excited about the beavers being released in Enfield, they want to see more nature in London.' Goldsmith, who has been tasked with looking at viable areas to rewild, said: 'The plan is to develop Knepp-style rewilding projects around the periphery of Greater London in such places as the Dagenham Marshes; at Enfield, where a big nature restoration project is already under way; and in the Colne valley. These areas will be London's core nature areas with real ecological integrity. 'We must look to create connectivity in the form of threads of nature crisscrossing the city, north-south, east-west, making use for example of the banks on either side of railways, canals and rivers.' The team is also discussing the creation of new 'microparks' inspired by those in Japanese cities, to increase access to green space in nature-deprived areas and to act as 'stepping stones' for wildlife. It may seem surprising that Goldsmith, the brother of Khan's former foe Zac, who ran against him during a fractious mayoral campaign in 2016, is working closely with the mayor to make the capital wilder. But it seems the brothers and the mayor have let bygones be bygones. 'We made friends,' Goldsmith said. 'I met Sadiq at a meeting at the Cop26 in Glasgow and we spent some time together and had a nice chat. I suggested that a rewilding taskforce in London would be a really exciting innovation, not least given London is making strides on all kinds of aspects of the climate agenda.' And the mayor immediately signed up. 'He was wildly enthusiastic about it,' the conservationist said. Goldsmith, who is in the process of rewilding his own estate in Somerset, which currently boasts beavers and wild boar that he says came of their own accord after a suitable habitat was created for them, used his contacts to help create a group of experts who are bringing wildlife back to the capital. The group includes the UK's most famous rewilder, Isabella Tree, whose success at Knepp Castle has made headlines worldwide. She has recently reintroduced beavers to the estate, and her work has brought back species including nightingales and storks to the Sussex countryside. Another expert is the RSPB's Nick Bruce-White. The bird charity's regional director for southern England has been drafted in to consult on how to bring various bird species back to London and improve the habitats across the city. 'We are talking about bringing back species along the Thames such as redshank, and lapwing. So there are some areas already where those birds are starting to come back, such as our Rainham Marshes reserve, but the Thames estuary would have once been an absolute haven for breeding waders and all sorts of duck species over the winter - and geese as well. And skylarks, all that kind of stuff. So, we'd be creating a really wild kind of estuary,' he said. And the group is insistent that the rewilding movement will be a community campaign. Rodrigues said: 'The point of talking about it as an urban taskforce is it isn't just a few landowners changing their land - the point of it is we are being told about how excited people are about seeing nature introduced, it is important for health, for flood and climate resilience, it's something everyone can be involved with.' Bruce-White agreed and said the new rewilded areas would be open for the people of London to enjoy. 'We want people to connect with and enjoy these places,' he said. 'They should be wonderful places to go. If people aren't connected with nature and connected with their landscapes then we're all doomed, probably, aren't we? Nature only wins when people care about it.'", "f8a3ccdc8c2a641a635f2c189ad4524c5ba890738c69f56e7693603f": "For more than five years, Deborah James, the presenter of the BBC podcast You, Me and the Big C, has put a spotlight on a cancer otherwise left in the dark, and with such authority that she was awarded a damehood late on Thursday. With candour and humour, James has kept her co-hosts, listeners and social media followers up to date with her treatment for bowel cancer, even going so far as to dress up in a 'poo suit' in a BBC recording studio. Bowel cancer can be a tricky subject matter. Although it is the fourth most common and second deadliest cancer in the UK, people shy away from talking about it owing to embarrassment about symptoms. The podcast has met with praise and admiration from charities, experts and patients. When Louise Bolotin came across James's story she 'felt some solidarity, because she's at the stage where she's at hospice at home care and that will be what happens to me as well.' Bolotin, 60, received a diagnosis in January after going to A&E with constant vomiting. Doctors discovered that the cancer in her bowel had spread to her liver, chest and lungs. 'I had no idea that I had cancer, so when I was told not only do I have cancer but it's terminal and it has already spread, that was a bit of a shock,' Bolotin said. Of James, she added: 'We're both in the same situation really. Both facing end of life.' James, who was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in 2016, said on Monday that she was under hospice at home care and 'spending my time surrounded by my family'. By Friday, her Bowelbabe Fund, with shared links to charities including Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, had raised more than PS4m.  'Over the last five years, I've campaigned, I've spoken about awareness, I've shared my story, my reason for laughs, for giggles, for showing that you can live with cancer,' James told the BBC. 'Before I die the one thing I knew I wanted to do was set up a fund that can continue working on things that gave me life.' James is a patron of Bowel Cancer UK, among other charities. After her news on Monday, traffic to the charity's website surged to nine times that of a typical day. Genevieve Edwards, the charity's chief executive, said: 'She has this incredible ability to motivate people and get people talking about the signs and symptoms.' The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who donated to James's fund, called her efforts to raise awareness and end the stigma around bowel cancer 'inspiring', and Boris Johnson said the damehood was richly deserved. 'Deborah has been an inspiration and her honesty, warmth and courage has been a source of strength to so many people,' he tweeted. Prof David Cunningham, a consultant medical oncologist and director of clinical research at the Royal Marsden hospital in London, said he had no doubt James 'has saved lives by encouraging people to see a GP about any worrying symptoms'. Bowel cancer predominantly affects people over 60, an individual's risk also depends on their sex, genetics and lifestyle factors. When detected early it can be tackled with surgery, chemotherapy or other therapies. In England, guidelines call for testing for people over 50, including at-home faecal testing (FIT) or examinations done at clinics or hospitals. Symptoms include blood in stools, persistent change in bowel habits, stomach pains or lumps, sudden fatigue and weight loss. When the Guardian spoke to Bolotin, a retired freelance journalist and editor, she was travelling to Edinburgh to see a group of childhood friends for the last time. 'I'm completely at peace with my decision and I'm expecting what's coming, and in the meantime I'm just trying to live my life as best as I can,' she said. For others, she advised: 'Keep an eye out for symptoms, but bear in mind that symptoms are not always obvious.'", "b4a892f6ad08fcba8047b16fc4163774dd2b3505c2ee3743927b72d4": "The effort to install local election officials who promote Donald Trump's lie that the 2020 election was stolen has seen particular success in the crucial swing state of Georgia, where at least eight county election officials are promoters of the falsehood, a Guardian investigation has found. The officials span the state, from suburban counties outside Atlanta to rural counties near the Tennessee and Alabama borders. All have substantial power over the administration of local, state and national elections in their counties, often with little oversight beyond scantly attended public meetings and small-town newspapers. They include:  one election official who has posted in support of a discredited election conspiracist who believes the alleged presence of bamboo in paper ballots is proof they came from Asia, and thus show interference from China;  two officials who tried, on the basis of bogus fraud allegations, to decertify the results of the January 2021 runoff that resulted in the election of the state's first Black senator;  one official who insisted that Georgia's election laws needed to change if Republicans were going to 'have a shot' at winning future elections. All continue to serve in their appointed positions as county election board officials in Floyd, Forsyth, Gwinnett, Hall, Jackson, Lumpkin and Spalding counties. None responded to requests for comment from the Guardian. The investigation looked at seven counties out of 159, meaning the number of election officials who support election conspiracy theories could be much higher. 'These disturbing facts bring to light what we've known for a while: support for the big lie is growing - the result of powerful political actors stoking a dangerous fire,' the voting rights group New Georgia Project said in a statement. 'There is absolutely no place on our boards of elections, or in any of our elected offices, for leaders who refuse to accept the results of fair and certified elections.' Election boards have access to voter rolls, and make rules about polling places, ballots and voter registration. They also make determinations on ballots in which the voters' intention is unclear. The boards seat between four and five members, usually split evenly between the two main parties with a tie-breaking, 'non-partisan' member often chosen by the county commission or a local judge. With 159 counties, Georgia therefore has hundreds of county election board officials, creating and changing election policy on a weekly basis with little other than local activists and press to track them. Among them is Dottie Krull, a 79-year-old Republican on the Lumpkin county election board, located a little over an hour north of Atlanta. Shortly after the 2020 election, Krull began posting about the big lie on her personal Facebook page. 'I guess we all know why Biden stayed in his basement and didn't campaign,' Krull quoted a friend as saying. 'He knew he didn't need to.' In Forsyth county, elections board member Joel Natt was present on a conference call with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and other election officials when he blamed unspecified election 'irregularities' as a reason why Georgians of both parties were becoming 'less and less trusting' of Raffensperger's office. In Floyd county, Pam Peters was described by an election conspiracy theorist who spoke to the Washington Post as an 'investigative partner'. Days before election day, Peters volunteered for Trump in Rome, Georgia. In Hall county, elections board member Tom Smiley said he took issue with claims that the 2020 election saw no fraud, saying he would amend it to 'NO FRAUD DISCOVERED'. Perhaps no elections board official has been the subject of as much controversy as Alice O'Lenick, chair of the Gwinnett county board of registration. O'Lenick has been a vocal supporter of restrictions to poll access and voting rights, her critics say. In 2016, O'Lenick opposed the use of Spanish-language ballots. (The county was eventually forced to include them by the US Census Bureau under the Voting Rights Act.) She has also supported the abolition of so-called 'no excuse' absentee voting, advocating that only the elderly or infirm would be allowed to fill out an absentee ballot; opposed the use of drop boxes, alleging spurious claims of ballot harvesting; served on a task force that recommended sweeping changes to voting rights so Republicans could 'at least have a shot' at winning elections; and alleged without providing direct evidence that Gwinnett county saw an uptick in attempted voting by undocumented immigrants. In Spalding county, election board chair Ben Johnson continues to post prolifically about a wide variety of far-right conspiracy theories, including those involving alleged ballot harvesting and Dominion voting machines. In late April, Johnson shared a photo from a Canadian news outlet that had been altered to proclaim that conspiracy theorists 'keep getting things right'. In Jackson county, Republican election board officials Larry Ewing and Jeff Hughes, after a campaign by the national conservative group True the Vote, forced an investigation into 211 people who had voted after recently changing their address, in the unsubstantiated belief that up to 2,000 Jackson county residents who had recently changed their addresses could have voted illegally. The pair also refused to certify the runoff election of Raphael Warnock, the state's first Black senator, until the 211 names were passed on to the secretary of state for further investigation. The results were eventually certified with their dissent. 'I can't stress enough how widespread the election fraud lies have taken hold in the area,' said Pete Fuller, chair of the Jackson county Democratic party. 'It's very disconcerting how effective the misinformation has been.'", "37dd3c57362a09d1fe572f1b01edc55b6b0e2ce888e85f5fc3111136": "The Queen is likely to perform more virtual engagements and any future official physical engagements will continue to be jointly diaried with other members of the royal family as part of ongoing adjustments due to her 'episodic mobility problems'. While she will continue to perform her constitutional role as head of state, her role as head of nation, which is not part of her formal constitutional duties, is increasingly being shared amongst other senior royals. The state opening of parliament, at which she authorised Prince Charles and Prince William to deputise for her this week, is the only head of state engagement so far that she has been unable to fulfil in recent years as her age catches up with the 96-year-old monarch. But sources said she had no reason to relinquish more head of state duties, which as sovereign include the appointment of the prime minister, approval of parliamentary legislation, approval of official appointments and approval of secondary legislation as head of the privy council. The only one she has been forced to delegate, through the issuing of letters patent, is the state opening because it requires a physical appearance. But all the others can be performed virtually if needed, and she has been doing this for some time now, according to insiders. On Wednesday she attended privy council virtually; she is still receiving government 'red boxes' and greeting ambassadors virtually; and on Monday she received via video link the Australians of the year, introduced by the Australian governor general David Hurley. Her diary as head of nation had definitely 'flexed', said one source. It is as head of nation that she makes her Christmas broadcast, sends messages of congratulation on national achievements, and sends messages of condolence at times of national, international and commonwealth crisis. But several such events also include physical appearances, such as trooping the colour, Garter Day, Royal Ascot and garden parties, as well as visits to charities and patronages. She did appear at the Royal Windsor horse show on Friday to watch her animals take to the parade ring. The Queen has not carried out any investitures since the Covid pandemic began, except for that of Captain Sir Tom Moore, whom she knighted in a unique ceremony at Windsor Castle. Investitures are now regularly conducted by Prince Charles, Prince William and Princess Anne. It has already been announced she will not be attending the Buckingham Palace garden parties, and Prince Charles stood in for her at the first of this summer on Wednesday. Charles had already stepped in to represent her at the traditional coin-giving ceremony known as the Maundy service, which she missed for the first time in April. Diaries between Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace have been and are being more closely coordinated than before to make sure another royal is at head of nation events if needed, so that if it is decided at the 11th hour the Queen will not attend, another royal will be there. While it is not yet known which events over the platinum jubilee weekend she will attend, it is hoped she will at least appear on Buckingham Palace balcony following trooping the colour on 2 June and at the St Paul's Cathedral service of thanksgiving on 3 June. It is also hoped she will be at the Royal Windsor horse show's jubilee 'Gallop Through History' event on Sunday, which will reportedly feature 10 of her 12 great-grandchildren in horse-drawn carriages, including the Cambridges' three children George, Charlotte and Louis.", "b6a06344a5a53e6c3b10858d3e90344aad410ab005c3107a20e7c789": "", "5f8ad2b1b90c27659ae8f8d76d2d85480ae49ccc54eb1fe840eb2185": "", "d4cf06108d09c5c120896be434f4ab7cdab4859c6a50a654d994d8ad": "In the early hours of the morning, before sunrise, the refugees in Borama gather around vendors selling bread out of wheelbarrows, hoping for handouts. The nearby tea shops do what they can to help, dishing out hot drinks to hundreds of people who have left fighting and drought in Ethiopia for sanctuary in Somaliland's border city. At night, families lie in rows on the pavements, huddled under blankets. In January, Anajow Abana travelled 300km from Tigray, in northern Ethiopia, to Somaliland. She and her three-year-old daughter are living on the city's streets, surviving on the charity of local people. 'We fled fighting and drought,' she says. 'The fighting was so bad and they killed my husband and two of my children. It took us 12 days to get here and was such a difficult time,' she says. Mimi Tadasse is also living on the streets of Borama. It took her 14 days to reach the city. 'We got here a week ago,' she says. 'It was a hard journey. We had to go through areas of fighting, and it was very dangerous.' Tadasse is from the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which has been engulfed in conflict during the war that began between forces loyal to the Tigrayan regional government and the Ethiopian armed forces in November 2020, and quickly spiralled to include a number of armed groups, regional militias and the Eritrean military. Mohamed Warsame (Baradho), the mayor of Borama, which is home to about 200,000 people, believes the number of refugees in the city is much higher than estimates. According to immigration officials, at least 10,000 people arrived in the first two months of 2022, he says, and many more will have crossed the porous border unofficially. Many refugees travel on to the capital Hargeisa and other areas, rather than staying in Borama. Some walk as far as Bosaso on the coast and try to get a boat across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen. From there, they walk to Saudi Arabia in the hope of finding employment as labourers or shepherds. People arriving from the Somali region of Ethiopia find it easier to assimilate and set up a shelter in the refugee camps, as they speak the language; it is much more challenging for those from Tigray, Amhara or Oromia. There are two refugee camps in Borama, where it is estimated more than 2,000 families reside. Some have been in the camps for more than 20 years, others just a few days. There is little infrastructure, but there is a school built by Unicef, and local and international NGOs have assisted with latrines and water points. The plight of the refugees in Borama is part of a growing crisis engulfing the Horn of Africa, where 16 million people in Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia are in dire need of food. Consecutive droughts have exacerbated the effects of war, leading to water scarcity, livestock deaths, soaring food prices and acute insecurity. A poor start to the 2022 rainy season coupled with the war in Ukraine could have catastrophic results, Save the Children warned in April. The mass movement of vulnerable people over insecure border areas threatens to further destabilise the region and harm communities, with many migrants facing the additional threat of unexploded ordnance (UXO) and landmines as they move through unfamiliar territories. The border with Ethiopia has been heavily fought over since the 60s, particularly during the 80s and 90s, meaning former battle sites are heavily contaminated with UXO. Dayis Amin and his wife, Suldan, are living in a refugee camp in Borama with their eight children having fled a disputed area close to Harar, Ethiopia. They say they were unable to grow any crops because of fighting and drought. Amin says: 'It is difficult here. Some days we eat nothing. 'We had a good life before. We had 20 cows and 30 sheep. Then there was trouble, and we couldn't get by. We couldn't farm because of the fighting, so when the drought came all the animals died. 'There were also explosions where we were, from the fighting. About six months ago, a group of children were playing with a metal item just 150 metres from our house. There was an explosion and five children died.' Omar Mohammed, Somalia country director for MAG, a humanitarian organisation that clears UXO and landmines, says: 'Moving across borders into Somaliland to seek humanitarian assistance or better conditions is the only way to cope for these people - while the UXOs and mines litter both sides of the border from previous wars. The UN estimates there were more than 317,000 newly displaced people within Somalia in January 2022 due to conflict and drought-related issues. 'We are doing our best to keep people safe by advising them of the risks of unexploded ordnance and landmines in the border areas, but they face multiple other risks because of the drought. Women and girls are having to walk longer distances to access water, for instance, exposing them to gender-based violence.' In the town of Baligubadle, approximately 170km south-east of Borama, refugees from Ethiopia arrive on a daily basis, along with displaced Somalis seeking water and food. 'People are dying,' says Abdi Karim Mohamed, director of families and livelihoods for the local government, 'We don't have enough water and we need help. Our reservoirs are dry. We bring water trucks all the way from Hargeisa, but that is very expensive and we can't manage to do that very often.' The Abdi Rahman family have just arrived in the town and are setting up makeshift shelters. 'We had to leave our home because the animals were dying because of the drought,' says the family matriarch, Koos. 'We had 200 goats before, but now we have only five. We have one cow - we lost four. The first animal died three months ago and then more died as they became weaker. We had lived there for generations but every year it became harder and harder to survive.' Rein Paulsen, director for emergencies and resilience at the UN Food and Agriculture Programme (FAO) says: 'We are most definitely now sitting on the brink of catastrophe, time is running out.' 'Harvests are ruined,' says Michael Dunford, regional director for the east Africa bureau of the UN World Food Programme (WFP). 'Livestock are dying, and hunger is growing.' Should the rains continue to fail, it will be the first time in more than 40 years that four dry seasons will have occurred consecutively. For people like Abana, and the millions of already vulnerable people in this part of the world, that is a terrifying prospect.

'We are exposing and targeting the shady network propping up Putin's luxury lifestyle and tightening the vice on his inner circle,' the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said in a statement on Friday. 'We will keep going with sanctions on all those aiding and abetting Putin's aggression until Ukraine prevails.' A UK Foreign Office statement describing Kabaeva said: 'Alina Kabaeva, a retired Olympic gymnast. Kabaeva has risen to become chair of the board of the National Media Group, reportedly the largest private Russian media company. She is alleged to have a close personal relationship with Putin, and previously sat as a deputy in the Duma for Putin's United Russia.'", "8369f0aaec084a26f238fa70fe6004806744fca1536f427c981cc258": "", "d65481d8586c0d0d75efcbbba06be79b1adb2e5013686f33ab8683a7": "", "fab99b3f401a2321af6864a860d7e6795ebd349f9689bbe178b47b75": "The top Democrat and Republican in the US Senate joined forces in a rare moment of unity on Thursday in an attempt to pass $40bn in aid for Ukraine, only to be stymied by a single Republican lawmaker: the Kentucky libertarian Rand Paul. Faced with the prospect of an extended delay for the package that passed the House of Representatives on Tuesday, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, sought to move forward on the aid package only to be blocked by Paul, a fiscal hawk who objects to the amount of spending proposed. The stalemate delayed passage of the measure into next week. The Senate has scheduled an initial procedural vote on the bill for late Monday afternoon. It was unclear whether that vote would then speed passage of the Ukraine aid. Alternatively, passage could come around the middle of next week if any senator wants to force a series of legislative steps before a final vote. As the Ukraine aid bill became caught in the Senate's procedural gears, Schumer pleaded for fast action: 'The package is ready to go, the vast majority of senators on both sides of the aisle want it.' He added: 'If Senator Paul persists in his reckless demands ... all he will accomplish is to single-handedly delay desperately needed Ukraine aid.' But Paul was not moved. The delay into next week could cause problems for western countries trying to bolster Ukraine in its fight against Russia. The Biden administration has said that by 19 May it expects to run out of available funds to draw on under an authority that allows the president to authorize the transfer of weapons without congressional approval in response to an emergency. Paul is demanding that the legislation be altered to require an inspector general to oversee spending on Ukraine. Without his agreement, the Senate must follow a lengthy process stipulated by the chamber's arcane rules. McConnell, Paul's fellow senator from Kentucky, weighed in, saying: 'Ukraine is not asking us to fight this war. They're only asking for the resources they need to defend themselves against this deranged invasion. And they need this help right now.' The House passed the Ukraine spending bill by 368 to 57, with only Republicans voting against it. Joe Biden had asked Congress to approve an additional $33bn in aid for Ukraine. But lawmakers decided to increase the military and humanitarian funding. 'This is the second spending bill for Ukraine in two months. And this bill is three times larger than the first,' Paul said before formally blocking the aid package. 'Congress just wants to keep on spending, and spending.' The aid package had previously included more spending for dealing with Covid-19 in the US, but the two causes were decoupled after Republicans balked. Meanwhile, the White House Covid-19 coordinator, Ashish Jha, issued a dire warning that the US will be increasingly vulnerable to the coronavirus this fall and winter if Congress does not swiftly approve new funding for more vaccines and treatments. In an Associated Press interview, Jha said Americans' immune protection from the virus was waning, the virus was adapting to be more contagious and booster doses for most people would be necessary, with the potential for enhanced protection from a new generation of shots. His warning came as the White House said there could be up to 100m infections from the virus later this year and as Biden somberly ordered flags to half-staff to mark the imminent milestone of 1 million US Covid deaths.", "ec29b4cdc0bbe72ef1cad44f82ddbf716797cbdf3900446a0f1eb452": "When the soldiers of an elite Russian army brigade were told in early April to prepare for a second deployment to Ukraine, fear broke out among the ranks.  The unit, stationed in Russia's far east during peacetime, first entered Ukraine from Belarus when the war started at the end of February and saw bitter combat with Ukrainian forces. 'It soon became clear that not everyone was onboard with it. Many of us simply did not want to go back,' said Dmitri, a member of the unit who asked not to be identified with his real name. 'I want to return to my family - and not in a casket.' Along with eight others, Dmitri told his commanders that he refused to rejoin the invasion. 'They were furious. But they eventually calmed down because there wasn't much they could do,' he said. He was soon transferred to Belgorod, a Russian city close to the border with Ukraine, where he has been stationed since. 'I have served for five years in the army. My contract ends in June. I will serve my remaining time and then I am out of here,' he said. 'I have nothing to be ashamed of. We aren't officially in a state of war, so they could not force me to go.' Dmitri's refusal to fight highlights some of the military difficulties the Russian army has faced as a result of the Kremlin's political decision not to formally declare war on Ukraine - preferring instead to describe the invasion, which will soon reach its fourth month, as a 'special military operation'. Under Russian military rules, troops who refuse to fight in Ukraine can face dismissal but cannot be prosecuted, said Mikhail Benyash, a lawyer who has been advising soldiers who choose that option. Benyash said 'hundreds and hundreds' of soldiers had been in touch with his team for advice on how they could avoid being sent to fight. Among them were 12 national guardsmen from Russia's southern city of Krasnodar who were fired after refusing to go to Ukraine. 'Commanders try to threaten their soldiers with prison time if they dissent, but we tell the soldiers that they can simply say no,' Benyash said, adding that he was not aware of any criminal cases against soldiers who refused to fight. 'There are no legal grounds to start a criminal case if a soldier refuses to fight while on Russian territory.' Many soldiers, therefore, have chosen to be fired or transferred rather than going into 'the meat grinder', he said. A similar account to Dmitri's was given to the BBC's Russian service by Sergey Bokov, a 23-year-old soldier who at the end of April decided to leave the army after fighting in Ukraine. 'Our commanders didn't even argue with us because we were not the first ones to leave,' Bokov said. Pointing to Russia's military laws, Benyash said it would be more difficult for soldiers to refuse to fight if Russia were to declare a full-scale war. 'During wartime, rules are totally different. Refusal then would mean much harsher penalties. They would be looking at time in prison.' While the exact number of soldiers refusing to fight remains unclear, such stories illustrate what military experts and western governments say is one of Russia's biggest obstacles in Ukraine: a severe shortage of infantry soldiers. Moscow initially put about 80% of its main ground combat forces - 150,000 men - into the war in February, according to western officials. But significant damage has been done to that army, which has confronted logistical problems, poor morale and an underestimated Ukrainian resistance. 'Putin needs to make a decision regarding mobilisation in the coming weeks,' said Rob Lee, a military analyst. 'Russia lacks sufficient ground units with contract soldiers for a sustainable rotation. The troops are getting exhausted - they won't be able to keep this up for a long period.' Lee said one option for the Kremlin would be to authorise the deployment of conscript units to Ukraine, despite Putin's earlier pledges that Russia would not use any conscripts in the war. 'Conscripts could fill some of the gaps, but they will be poorly trained. Many of the units that are supposed to train conscripts are fighting themselves,' Lee said. But without conscript battalions, Russia could soon 'struggle to hold the territory it currently controls in Ukraine, especially as Ukraine receives better equipment from Nato,' he said. Russian authorities quietly stepped up their efforts to recruit new soldiers as it became clear that a quick victory in Ukraine was unattainable. An investigation by the BBC's Russian service showed that Russia's defence ministry filled employment websites with vacancies, offering people with no combat experience opportunities to join the army on lucrative short-term contracts. Some large government-run companies have received letters urging them to sign up their staff for the army. Russia has also turned to mercenaries to bolster its war efforts, deploying fighters from the shadowy Kremlin-linked Wagner group. But analysts say voluntary recruits and mercenary groups are unlikely to lead to a substantial increase in the number of new soldiers, compared with the numbers that a partial or a full-scale mobilisation would bring. Despite speculation beforehand, Putin did not formally declare war on Ukraine during his Victory Day speech on 9 May. Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, said the authorities may be worried that a general mobilisation would antagonise large sections of the population that support the 'special operation'. Russians 'might be in favour of the conflict, but they don't actually want to fight,' he said, adding that a general mobilisation would entail 'colossal losses of untrained soldiers'. And while the current status of the conflict gives Russian soldiers a legal path to refuse participation, some soldiers have complained that it has also led to them not being adequately cared for. A junior sergeant said he was injured during one of the recent Ukrainian attacks on the Russian border territory where he was stationed. His superiors argued that he should not be given the monetary compensation of up to PS2,500 that wounded Russians are entitled to by law because his injury took place on Russian soil - meaning it did not fall under the rules of Russia's 'special military operation'. 'It is unfair, I am fighting in this war just as the others in Ukraine, risking my life,' the soldier said. 'If I don't get the compensation that I am entitled to soon, I will go public and make a major issue of it.'", "8d171332a29b49ff5954891f4503b435aa78861f77ee162c083f95ec": "In the days after Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine in late February, Vladimir Shurupov, a cardiologist from the Siberian city of Tomsk, felt he could not breathe properly. 'I was having panic attacks, I could not eat or sleep. I just knew I had to remove myself from this place, from this atmosphere,' he said. Shurupov, 40, had been a quiet critic of Putin's government for years, but he had never attended a protest of any kind, fearful of unwanted attention or arrest. When the war began, disgust with the regime combined with a fear he would be sent to the front. 'If there was mobilisation, I would have been called up as a military doctor, and this is not a war I would be willing to fight in,' he said. Shurupov discussed with his wife and two sons that perhaps they should try to leave the country. The family had minimal savings but he was able to sell his car for cash and buy four tickets to Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. Just two days after first discussing leaving, they flew out of Tomsk to Yerevan. After receiving Schengen visas, they moved on to Bulgaria. They have no plans ever to return home. The Shurupov family are among hundreds of thousands of Russians to have fled the country since the war began on 24 February. Putin has referred to such people as 'traitors and scum' and said their departure will help 'cleanse' Russian society. Many are opposition journalists or activists, whose work has in effect been criminalised under increasingly draconian wartime laws in Russia. Others are businesspeople fleeing sanctions. Some simply did not want to be part of a society where pro-war feelings are running so high. Shurupov estimated that of 30 colleagues at his hospital, only three were opposed to the war. Some of those who left in the days after the invasion have already decided to return, but many are set on making a new life abroad, at least until there are political changes in Russia. 'I don't want to live behind a new iron curtain. I just had a feeling that there was no future in Russia,' said Valery Zolotukhin, 39, a literary and theatre scholar who came to Armenia with his wife and seven-year-old daughter. 'In Russia, you're living inside the fantasy of a few people ... They've created an imaginary world and you're forced to be part of it.' A century ago, after the Bolsheviks took over Russia, millions of emigres fled to Istanbul, Prague and Harbin. Today there is an echo of that process as the cafes of Vilnius, Tbilisi and Yerevan are packed with Russians in the first stages of building a new life. Armenia is one of the most popular destinations, because no visa is required. It has also created favourable conditions for IT businesses, prompting the relocation of thousands of Russian tech professionals over the past two months. 'At the beginning, you walked down the street and saw all your friends from Moscow, and the people from St Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod you only normally see on Zoom calls,' said Maya Gorodova, a former commercial director at Russian startups, who has set up a coworking space in Yerevan with views to Mount Ararat from the windows. All 70 current tenants are recent arrivals from Russia, and Gorodova has received calls from Russians in Belgrade, Tbilisi, Tel Aviv and Bali, she said, asking for advice on setting up new work spaces for emigres. The outflow of tech professionals is likely to be a huge blow for Russia, which in recent years has become a highly digitised economy. But opposition to the war, a fear of possible mobilisation and the loss of contracts with foreign clients due to sanctions have combined to push many to the exit. At Hummus Kimchi, a new restaurant run by a brother and sister team transplanted from Moscow, recent arrivals to Yerevan discuss their next moves. Some have their eye on Britain's Global Talent visa and have paid thousands of pounds to agents who promise to craft their forms to match the Home Office's checklist. Others note that Germany offers citizenship within five years for arriving IT specialists. 'Of course these are all reserve options,' said one young tech professional, sipping a craft beer. 'Hopefully, Putin will die soon and we can all go back.' For many who have left, emigration was the final moment in a life of gritty opposition activity, including arrests and house searches. For others it was the start of a political awakening. One woman in her 30s, who did not want her name published, said she had always opposed Putin but had been too fearful to attend protests or post on Facebook. On the second day of the war she wore clothes in Ukrainian colours to work, and her colleagues began insulting her. She realised nobody in her social group shared her revulsion over the invasion. 'It's impossible to talk to any of my friends, I started chats with a few of them and it feels like they are just pressing control C, control V. They're all repeating the same phrases,' she said. She also left behind a long-term boyfriend who works in Russia's security services. Previously they had not discussed politics much, but before departing she wrote him a long letter setting out her opposition to the war. They have hardly spoken since. 'In a short time here I met more people who think like me than I did in the last few years in Moscow. And I realised that here I've stopped always calculating what I should say based on who I'm talking to. I feel so much freer,' she said. Many Russians in Yerevan spend long hours in the city's cafes and bars, philosophising about whether there was any way to have stopped Putin earlier, and whether they should have done more. Some remain worried about repercussions at home and speak in mealy mouthed euphemisms about 'the unfortunate events' or 'the Ukrainian situation'. Others are eager to express their wholehearted support for Ukraine. In Moscow, Elena Kamay ran Lambada Markets, which put on street markets beloved by the city's so-called 'creative class' that has sprung up over the past decade. Stalls sold vintage clothing, items by local designers and other artisan objects. 'Of course it was all a facade, we lived in a bubble. And now it's all over,' she said. Kamay moved to Yerevan at the beginning of March, and like many has been thinking back over the past decade from today's vantage point. She accepted that working in Moscow had involved 'doing a deal with your conscience', though she said she had been attending anti-government protests since 2011. Recently, she said, she had been rereading messages she had exchanged with Oksana Baulina, a Russian activist and journalist who left Russia two years ago and was killed by a Russian airstrike in Kyiv in March while reporting. 'I always thought she was exaggerating a bit when she described her views about Russia and the political system, but it turns out she was right all along,' she said. Elena Chegodayeva also arrived in Yerevan in March, and a few weeks later set up a school from an apartment in the city centre. The 50 pupils and 20 teachers have all recently arrived from Russia. Chegodayeva said she had been pondering the concept of collective responsibility since the war started. 'We are all Russians and we will have to take responsibility for this, just like Germans had to after the war,' she said. 'On the other hand, I was two years old when Putin was elected, so it's not entirely clear what more I could have done.' Chegodayeva, 24, said she had lost part of her university stipend for arguing with her professor about whether the annexation of Crimea was illegal, and received dawn visits to her apartment from police after taking part in protests. She said the case of a St Petersburg artist who faces 10 years in jail for replacing supermarket price tags with anti-war slogans showed protest in Russia now was futile. She will only return to Russia 'if there is revolution in the air', she said. Rather than try to persuade people to stay, Putin has celebrated the outflow of hundreds of thousands of educated, anti-war Russians. In a sinister video address in the middle of March, Putin criticised those who moved abroad or supported the west in its current battle with Moscow. 'Any people, and particularly the Russian people, are able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors, and simply spit them out like a fly that flew into their mouths,' he said, using some of the harshest language of his two decades in charge. There would be a 'natural and necessary cleansing of society', said Putin, which would be beneficial to the country in the long run. The question now is whether those who have left will gradually disconnect themselves from Russia, or form a powerful opposition to Putin and his regime from outside, rallying around political forces such as associates of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who are mostly now based in Vilnius. 'For 100 years, the understanding of emigration was that people quickly lost touch with Russia and didn't understand it, so nobody believed the political emigration might have a chance of playing a role in Russian politics,' said Andrei Soldatov, a co-author with Irina Borogan of a recent book about the history of Russians outside Russia. Now, however, the internet opens up very different possibilities. 'The country is still connected to the world. So many Russian journalists left the country and still have contact with their audiences, and this is an absolutely new development for the Kremlin,' Soldatov said. Before trying to change the regime, many of the emigres are first focused on trying to change the mind of war-supporting family members who have stayed behind, refusing to leave. Shurupov hopes his mother will eventually join the family in Europe, but so far she is resisting. 'I haven't been able to convince her about the war, and she doesn't want to leave. For me, this is a real tragedy.'", "77c6bc4b2c2dff172668d48d1f17feb7bb13879bdbc4d800645517c3": "Brexit minister Jacob Rees-Mogg has urged the Bank of England to hike interest rates, and rejected calls for an emergency budget to help struggling households. Speaking to Times Radio, Rees-Mogg said 'tighter monetary policy', ie higher borrowing costs, would help cool inflation, which could hit 10% by the end of the year. But he pushed back against helping people now through higher spending, even through calls for more assistance grow daily. Rees-Mogg said: But...'Long-term measures' don't help people who simply don't have the money to pay surging energy bills and rising food costs, though, which is why the boss of John Lewis yesterday called for a financial support package. The Bank of England is itself split over how fast to tighten policy. It raised interest rates to 1% last week, but three of the nine policymakers on the MPC wanted a bigger jump to 1.25%.  The committee is also divided about much further tightening will be needed, as it tries to balance pressures from inflation and slowing growth. Rees-Mogg, meanwhile, told GB News that increased public spending would fuel inflation:  But, a fiscal tightening at a time when the economy is alreading slowing, increases the risks of a downturn.... and sounds like a return to the economic policies of the 1980s... The US stock market has borne the brunt of this week's turbulence, due to the tumble in technology giants. The Nasdaq Composite has shed 6% so far this week, while the UK's FTSE is currently down less than 1% for the week, and Germany's DAX is actually over 1% higher. So far this year, the Nasdaq Composite has lost 28% -- as investors turned cold on fast-growing tech stocks which had previously enjoyed generous valuations based on their future prospects, not their current profits. The Financial Times's Richard Waters has calculated that the five biggest tech companies have shed nearly $2.6tn in value since the start of the year, a 26% drop. But the axe is hanging ominously over smaller, high-growth tech companies, he adds: And here's a reminder of just how sharply tech stocks have fallen: Recession fears have also hurt copper, seen as a good measure of the health of the global economy. Copper is trading around a seven-month low in London today, at around $9,051 per tonne.  That puts copper on track for its sixth weekly fall in a row, due to fears that a global economic slowdown will hit demand. Cryptocurrency prices are recovering some ground this morning. Bitcoin (still over $30,000) and Etherium are both up around 9% over the last 24 hours, but that only recovers a little of this week's heavy losses. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says the dust seems to be settling in cryptocurrencies.  It's also been a rough week for gold, which hit its lowest level since February. Spot gold has dropped around 3% this week, and is trading around $1,826 per ounce, on track for its fourth weekly drop in a row. Gold is often pitched as a hedge against inflation, and market volatility, so you might have expected a rally. However, gold's lack of a yield can count against it -- the rise in short-term interest rates and bond yields mean there are better opportunities to make (or lose!) money. Also, the surge in the US dollar to a 20-year high has hit prices of assets priced in dollars. Craig Erlam of OANDA says: Iron ore prices are heading for its biggest weekly drop since mid-February, as China's Covid-19 restrictions hit demand. The steel-making ingredient was steady near $126 a ton in Singapore on Friday and is down around 9% this week, according to Bloomberg data. The lockdown in Shanghai, and curbs in other cities, is hitting demand for steel -- while the wider global slowdown could also weigh on factory activity. Bloomberg explains: Concerns about China's property sector rose this week too, after developer Sunac China missed a bond repayment. Cryptocurrencies nursed large losses on Friday, with bitcoin trading near $30,000 and set for a record losing streak as the collapse of TerraUSD, a so-called stablecoin, rippled through markets, Reuters reports. Crypto assets have also been swept up in broad selling of risky investments on worries about high inflation and rising interest rates. Sentiment is particularly fragile, as tokens supposed to be pegged to the dollar have faltered. Bitcoin the largest cryptocurrency by total market value, managed to bounce in the Asia session and traded at $30,300, up 5%. It has staged something of a recovery from a 16-month low of around $25,400 reached on Thursday. But it remains far below week-ago levels of around $40,000 and, unless there is a rebound in weekend trade, is headed for a record seventh consecutive weekly loss. 'I don't think the worst is over,' said Scottie Siu, investment director of Axion Global Asset Management, a Hong Kong based firm that runs a crypto index fund. More here. There's some relief in the European markets this morning, with stocks opening higher after a choppy week. In the City, the FTSE 100 index is up 71 points, or 1%, led by online grocery business Ocado - up 5% (but still down 50% so far this year). Financial stocks are also rallying, with Standard Chartered (+3.2%) and Prudential (+2.8%) in the risers. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says:  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. It's been a bruising, and confusing, week in the markets. Volatiltiy has spiked, triggered by growing signs that the world economy is slowing, and fears of recessions in some major economies including the UK. Wall Street is on track for its worst week since early January, with the S&P 500 index having lost over 4.7% since Monday morning (although there's still time for a recovery, or another jolting fall, today). That would be the S&P 500's sixth weekly loss in a row, the worst streak of weekly losses since 2011, when it also fell for six weeks running amid the eurozone debt crisis. Last night, the S&P 500 fell to the brink of a bear market, as fears over the health of the global economy, high inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions hit assets. Jim Reid, market strategist at Deutsche Bank,says there has been some 'incredible intraday volatility' across a range of asset classes.  The turmoil in the crypto market has also added to tensions in the wider markets. The meltdown of TerraUSD this week, and the luna coin linked to it, showed the risks of stablecoins which claim to be fixed to a certain asset. Panic deepened yesterday as another major stablecoin, Tether, failed to maintain its link with the US dollar. Tether (which is meant to be pegged at $1), dropped as low as 95 cents... and although it has recovered, it's not yet recovered that $1 peg. Ratings group Fitch said the troubles at Tether and TerraUSD 'highlight the fragile nature of private stablecoins, and will accelerate calls for regulation'. The wobble sent Bitcoin reeling to 16-month lows towards $25,000 las night -- although it has bounced back to $30,000 this morning. Reuters reports that bitcoin is headed for a record seventh consecutive weekly loss. Investors are also fretting that the US economy could suffer a 'hard landing', as interest rates are raised sharply. Overnight, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that a 'soft landing' could be out of his control.  Powell told NPR's 'Marketplace' that high inflation and economic problems beyond the US could thwart his efforts to cool prices without causing a recession. Powell also signalled the Fed willpush ahead with 50bp hikes at the June and July meetings. And he warned that bringing inflation down to target will 'also include some pain', but it would be more painful if inflation got entrenched.", "f01c243cd5fe46b9b2c141ba6d1cb2e03057b70ab0a03501afa99f91": "An Indian couple are taking their son to court demanding that he and his wife either produce a grandchild within a year or cough up almost $650,000. Sanjeev and Sadhana Prasad say that they exhausted their savings raising and educating their pilot son and paying for a lavish wedding. Now they want payback. 'My son has been married for six years but they are still not planning a baby,' the couple said in their petition filed with a court in Haridwar last week. 'At least if we have a grandchild to spend time with, our pain will become bearable.' The compensation they are demanding - 50m rupees ($646,000) - includes the cost of a wedding reception in a five-star hotel, a luxury car worth $80,000 and paying for the couple's honeymoon abroad, the Times of India reported on Thursday. The parents also forked out $65,000 to get their son trained as a pilot in the US only for him to return to India unemployed, the paper said. 'We also had to take a loan to build our house and now we are going through a lot of financial hardships,' the couple said in their petition. 'Mentally too we are quite disturbed because we are living alone.' The couple's lawyer, Arvind Kumar, said the petition would be taken up for hearing by the court in northern India on 17 May. India has a strong joint family system with many generations - including grandparents, nephews, aunts and uncles - often living in the same household.

Based on analysis by the veteran pollster Peter Kellner, it points to particular problems for Labour with two groups: the 26% of voters who fit into the formal definition of middle class; and the 12% who would be defined as working class by pollsters but consider themselves middle class. The first group voted 57% to remain in the EU, yet the Conservatives were 22% ahead with these voters in 2019, despite their central message being that they would 'get Brexit done'. These voters, the former Labour leader suggests, are 'worried about issues like tax and economic competence'. The second group, whom Blair calls the 'aspirational working class', voted to leave the EU by a narrower 53% but backed the Conservatives over Labour by a 32% margin. In a punchy foreword, Blair claims of this latter group: 'A large number voted Conservative despite disagreeing with the party on Brexit. They thought Labour's far-left economic policy was a bigger threat than Brexit.' Without what he calls the 'millstone' of Starmer's predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, Blair claims Labour can win many of these voters back - and analysis of recent polling in the report shows a 12% swing to Labour among this 'blue-collar aspirational' group. The former prime minister suggests they are social conservatives, and thus urges Labour to ensure it is on the centre ground on 'culture war' issues such as transgender rights. Blair says the party should 'plant Labour's feet clearly near the centre of gravity of the British people, who want fair treatment for all and an end to prejudice, but distrust and dislike the 'cancel culture', 'woke' mentality.' Labour has sometimes appeared to struggle with culture war issues. For example, Starmer and the party chair, Anneliese Dodds, were criticised recently for being unable to give a straightforward answer to the question: what is a woman? A clearer frontbench line has since been agreed, resulting in the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, telling an interviewer: 'Men have penises, women have vaginas, here ends my biology lesson.' The Conservative party co-chair Oliver Dowden has sought to capitalise on the party's discomfort, accusing Starmer in a recent speech of 'kowtowing to the cancel culture brigade' and claiming: 'The Corbynistas, they are still there.' Starmer has been accused by some on the left of Labour of winning the leadership under false pretences by espousing key tenets of Corbynism during the campaign in 2020 and then moving towards the centre ground. Blair also calls on Labour to work on rebuilding its economic credibility, as he says the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has already begun to do. 'Labour must cure both its cultural and its economic aspiration problems. It must do the first to regain those voters who went Tory despite being traditional blue collar. These are the northern 'red wallers'. But Labour must also do the second to have any realistic chance of winning,' he says. He also warns Starmer against excessive caution - something the Labour leader is charged with by some colleagues. 'The bane of progressive politics is to think the choice is between being voter-friendly and boring, or exciting and voter-repellent,' he says. As an example of the kind of radical policy he would like to see, Blair suggests tackling concerns about illegal immigration by introducing biometric ID as a precondition for accessing work and public services.", "80214fc4ee0f707e8bfe51ad0c0117a0f743c3a3898b32eba45d9208": "The Queen has arrived at the Royal Windsor Horse Show to watch her animals take to the parade ring. The 96-year-old monarch was driven on to the showground in a Range Rover. After missing the state opening of parliament, there had been speculation that she would not attend the annual event, which is one of the highlights of her year. She sat in the front passenger seat of the vehicle, casually dressed in a white blouse and a blue cardigan-style top and wearing sunglasses. As the Range Rover pulled up near the parade ring, the Queen spoke to a small group, thought to be officials from the show, through the open car window. She appeared relaxed, smiling and laughing as she chatted, while a few feet away dozens of photographers tried to capture the moment. Inside the parade ring, horses were put through their paces as classical music was played over the public address system. Dozens of members of the public were also keen to have a memento of the occasion, holding up camera phones to record their glimpse of the Queen. The monarch was last seen in public on 29 March when she attended a service commemorating the life of her late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, with senior royals and a congregation of hundreds. She reached her platinum jubilee in February, overcame a bout of Covid after testing positive that month, and celebrated her 96th birthday on 21 April privately at her Sandringham estate. Last October, the Queen spent a night in hospital and over the following three months was under doctors' orders to conduct only light duties and missed a number of prominent events.

Hair loss is much more prevalent among men than women so using it to describe someone is a form of discrimination, a judge has concluded. Commenting on a man's baldness in the workplace is equivalent to remarking on the size of a woman's breasts, the finding suggests. The ruling - made by a panel of three men who in making their judgment bemoaned their own lack of hair - comes in a case between a veteran electrician and the manufacturing firm where he was employed. Tony Finn - who is in line for compensation - had worked for the West Yorkshire-based British Bung Company for almost 24 years when he was fired in May last year. He took the company to the tribunal claiming, among other things, he had been the victim of sexual harassment after an incident with the factory supervisor, Jamie King. Finn alleged that during a shopfloor row in July 2019, King had referred to him as a 'bald cunt'. The tribunal heard Finn was less upset by the 'Anglo-Saxon' language than the comment on his appearance. The allegation resulted in the panel - led by Judge Jonathan Brain - deliberating on whether remarking on his baldness was simply insulting or actually harassment. 'We have little doubt that being referred to in this pejorative manner was unwanted conduct as far as [Finn] was concerned,' the tribunal found. 'This is strong language. Although, as we find, industrial language was commonplace on this West Yorkshire factory floor, in our judgment Mr King crossed the line by making remarks personal to the claimant about his appearance.' Finn had not complained about the use of 'industrial language' but was particularly affronted at being called bald, the panel said. 'It is difficult to conclude other than that Mr King uttered those words with the purpose of violating [Finn's] dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for him,' the judgment found. 'Of his own admission, Mr King's intention was to threaten [Finn] and to insult him. In our judgment, there is a connection between the word 'bald' on the one hand and the protected characteristic of sex on the other. '[The company's lawyer] was right to submit that women as well as men may be bald. However, as all three members of the tribunal will vouchsafe, baldness is much more prevalent in men than women. 'We find it to be inherently related to sex.' As part of its ruling, the panel raised a previous tribunal case where a man was found to have sexually harassed a woman by remarking on the size of her breasts to rebut the firm's point. 'It is much more likely that a person on the receiving end of a comment such as that which was made in [that] case would be female,' the tribunal said. 'So too, it is much more likely that a person on the receiving end of a remark such as that made by Mr King would be male. Mr King made the remark with a view to hurting the claimant by commenting on his appearance which is often found amongst men. 'The tribunal therefore determines that by referring to the claimant as a 'bald cunt' ... Mr King's conduct was unwanted, it was a violation of the claimant's dignity, it created an intimidating environment for him, it was done for that purpose, and it related to the claimant's sex.' Finn's compensation will be determined at a later date.", "47e96d6a4479d3f63b08cab1dd44c49e2772204135aac5f563b5eda5": "", "1f6aeda9621a0912838161a44da4bed8a2da992b323bf54a7b26158c": "", "af67c97c1409db8b527cd9e8f398bcec07f0780cee98c260451c0ae0": "", "9434e6fd6e4f7e6c4b4b7bd2e43840234bc7c0e9e0d4ed387de6998a": "", "b2645083494ebd4036d99d383ba5c4aee38303883de26a56af8c5c56": "", "a26aa9e403c1dd68e9da57eb4da3faf5ce5dc274b40080f3db1d3e0f": "", "a661072e0351f8830dc96cf894e50a94d1133e359e3d46c2bcb11cdb": "", "1eb1312f08550ad5d6320962e6ee1586506d6df285f0fb8500f595d7": "", "d32e621f9d42c6b64c8c2906fa6672a16b9619e1f7076aed0a1a7eea": "", "5e61c2def6a40d4f21e65ef67481fcceebd74ccfcb59f504dba26e06": "", "e298377479ebc02a3cac1109acc351338bb8d7b1e7ebe90d3652e536": "", "35591b517d001fe77bfcb4bd56f2faf51fff55b4f93217a8a99d03c0": "", "903fc136afc7b612d0d8ca48d2c88803cc87aef74cae0ed558ce4139": "", "7efcfb5d7501177d1046c28445f337a02a4b505c3546bf238ea1c3c0": "The world's biggest fossil fuel firms are quietly planning scores of 'carbon bomb' oil and gas projects that would drive the climate past internationally agreed temperature limits with catastrophic global impacts, a Guardian investigation shows. The exclusive data shows these firms are in effect placing multibillion-dollar bets against humanity halting global heating. Their huge investments in new fossil fuel production could pay off only if countries fail to rapidly slash carbon emissions, which scientists say is vital.  The oil and gas industry is extremely volatile but extraordinarily profitable, particularly when prices are high, as they are at present. ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron have made almost $2tn in profits in the past three decades, while recent price rises led BP's boss to describe the company as a 'cash machine'. The lure of colossal payouts in the years to come appears to be irresistible to the oil companies, despite the world's climate scientists stating in February that further delay in cutting fossil fuel use would mean missing our last chance 'to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all'. As the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, warned world leaders in April: 'Our addiction to fossil fuels is killing us.' Details of the projects being planned are not easily accessible but an investigation published in the Guardian shows: At the UN's Cop26 climate summit in November, after a quarter-century of annual negotiations that as yet have failed to deliver a fall in global emissions, countries around the world finally included the word 'coal' in their concluding decision. Even this belated mention of the dirtiest fossil fuel was fraught, leaving a 'deeply sorry' Cop president, Alok Sharma, fighting back tears on the podium after India announced a last-minute softening of the need to 'phase out coal' to 'phase down coal'. Nonetheless, the world agreed coal power was history - the question now was how quickly cheaper renewables could replace it, and how fair the transition would be for the small number of developing countries that still relied on it. But there was no mention of oil and gas in the Cop26 final deal, despite these being responsible for almost 60% of fossil fuel emissions. Furthermore, many of the rich countries, such as the US, that dominate international climate diplomacy and positioned themselves as climate leaders at the conference, are big players in new oil and gas projects. But unlike India, they avoided criticism. That lack of scrutiny prompted the Guardian to spend the months since Cop26 piecing together the clearest picture possible of forthcoming oil and gas exploration and production.  The world's scientists agree the planet is in deep trouble. In August, Guterres reacted strongly to a stark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading authority on climate science. '[This report] is a code red for humanity,' he said.  The IPCC states carbon emissions must fall by half by 2030 to preserve the chance of a liveable future, yet they show no sign of declining. Experts have been warning since at least 2011 that most of the world's fossil fuel reserves could not be burned without causing catastrophic global heating. In 2015, a high-profile analysis found that to limit global temperature below 2C, half of known oil reserves and a third of gas had to stay in the ground, along with 80% of coal. Today, the problem is even more acute. A better understanding of the devastating impacts of the climate crisis has led to the internationally agreed limit for global heating being lowered to 1.5C, to cut the risks of extreme heatwaves, droughts, and floods. In May 2021, a report from the International Energy Agency, previously seen as a conservative body, concluded there could be no new oil or gas fields or coalmines if the world was to reach net zero by 2050. More warnings soon followed. An updated scientific analysis found the proportion of fossil fuel reserves that would need to stay in the ground for 1.5C jumped to 60% for oil and gas and 90% for coal, while the UN warned that planned fossil fuel production 'vastly exceeds' the limit needed for 1.5C. In April, shocked by the latest IPCC report that said it was 'now or never' to start slashing emissions, Guterres launched an outspoken attack on companies and governments whose climate actions did not match their words. 'Simply put, they are lying, and the results will be catastrophic,' he said. 'Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness. 'Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.' The reaction to Russia's war in Ukraine has pushed oil and gas prices even higher, further incentivising bets on new fields and infrastructure that would last decades.  The failure of countries to 'build back greener' after the Covid-19 pandemic or the 2008 financial crash was not a good omen, and Guterres said: 'Fossil fuel interests are now cynically using the war in Ukraine to lock in a high-carbon future.' Assessing future oil and gas developments is challenging: the sector is complex and often secretive, public information is scarce and hard to find and assess. But a global team of Guardian environment reporters has worked with leading thinktanks, analysts and academics across the world over the past five months and now we can answer a series of questions that reveal the scale of the sector's plans. First, how much production is due to come from the projects that are likely to start drilling before the end of this crucial decade? Next, where exactly are the biggest projects around the world, the so-called carbon bombs that would explode the climate? We also followed the money: how much is going to be spent on oil and gas that cannot be burned safely, rather than invested in clean energy? And who benefits most from the fossil fuel subsidies that hide the true damage they cause? The answers to these key questions lead to an inescapable conclusion: if the projects go ahead, they will blow the world's rapidly shrinking cap on emissions that must be kept to enable a liveable future - known as the carbon budget. For all the promises made by many oil companies, the data shows they remain committed to their core business despite the consequences. The short-term expansion plans of oil and gas companies, such as ExxonMobil and Gazprom, are colossal. The Guardian's investigation has found that in the next seven or so years, they are likely to start producing oil and gas from projects that would ultimately deliver 192bn barrels, the equivalent of a decade of today's emissions from China. This estimate was provided by analysts at Urgewald, who used data from Rystad Energy, the industry standard source but not publicly available. Their Gogel database includes 887 companies that explore for and produce oil and gas, and covers 97% of short-term expansion plans. The companies have made a final financial commitment to projects that will deliver 116bn barrels, more than half of the 192bn barrel total. They have also invested heavily in the rest, including final development, engineering and operation plans. Such investment makes these projects likely to go ahead, barring drastic government action, Urgewald says. A third of the short-term expansion plans of oil and gas would come from 'unconventional' and riskier sources. These include fracking and ultra-deep offshore drilling, which are inherently more dangerous - as the oil and gas companies drill deeper, the number of spills, injuries and blowouts increase.  The 192bn barrels are split roughly 50:50 between liquids, including crude oil, and gas. Burning this would produce 73bn tonnes of CO2. But methane routinely leaks from gas operations and is a powerful greenhouse gas, trapping 86 times more heat than CO2 over 20 years. Including this impact, at a standard supply-chain leak rate of 2.3%, means the equivalent of 97bn tonnes of CO2 added to the atmosphere and driving us faster towards climate hell. State oil companies lead the Urgewald short-term expansion list, with Qatar Energy, Russia's Gazprom and Saudi Aramco the top three. Half of Gazprom's projected expansion is in the fragile Arctic, though the long-term implications of Russia's war in Ukraine on its fossil fuel plans remain to be seen. The listed oil majors ExxonMobil, Total, Chevron, Shell and BP are all in the top 10. Unconventional and risky oil and gas production accounts for about 70% of the US majors' totals, while the proportion of fracking and ultra-deep water ranges from 30% to 60% for the European companies. 'Most oil and gas companies are just proceeding with business as usual,' Nils Bartsch at Urgewald said. 'Some just do not care. Some do not see their responsibility because governments around the world let them proceed, although of course these governments are often influenced by the industry.' Two-thirds of the 116bn barrels of oil and gas projects companies are financially committed to are in the Middle East, Russia and North America, according to data provided by Rystad Energy. Australia is anticipated to be a big contributor with 3.4bn barrels, more than from the whole of Europe, where fields are relatively depleted. A separate analysis for the Guardian by Urgewald on the average annual investment in oil and gas exploration over the past three years shows that, along with Shell, three large but rarely scrutinised Chinese companies occupy the top four slots: PetroChina, China National Offshore Oil Corporation, and Sinopec. Seven of the top 10 of these explorers are relying on fracking, ultra-deep water Arctic and tar sands developments for more than half of their expansion. Daniel Ribeiro has been fighting plans for a massive offshore pipeline and liquefied natural gas plant in Cabo Delgado province, Mozambique, since it was mooted more than 15 years ago. The scheme, which would lead to a huge increase in carbon emissions in one of the poorest and most climate-vulnerable countries, is backed by more than PS1bn from the UK government and has some of the biggest oil and gas corporations circling, scenting another huge payday. 'It is already creating a massive amount of disruption for the local fishing and subsistence farmers who are being moved off their land,' said Ribeiro, from the local Justica Ambiental campaign group. 'But if it goes ahead and countries like Mozambique are set off on a fossil fuel track, it will be a global disaster. We can forget tackling the climate crisis ... we will all suffer.' Research shared exclusively with the Guardian has identified the Cabo Delgado development as one of 195 carbon bombs, which - unless stopped - will drive catastrophic climate breakdown around the world. The term carbon bomb has been widely used in climate circles for the past decade to describe large fossil fuel projects or other big sources of carbon. The new research sets a specific definition: projects capable of pumping at least 1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions over their lifetimes. Projects identified include the new drilling wells springing up in the Canadian wilderness as part of the vast Montney Play oil and gas development, and the huge North Field gas fields in Qatar - named in the study as the biggest new oil and gas carbon bomb in the world. The study, led by Kjell Kuhne from the University of Leeds in the UK and published in the journal Energy Policy, found that just a few months after many of the world's politicians positioned themselves as climate leaders during the Cop26 conference in Glasgow, they were giving the green light to a massive global expansion of oil and gas production that scientists warn would push civilisation to the brink. Asad Rehman, a leading climate justice activist in the UK who was at the forefront of a global network of indigenous activists and civil society campaigners in Glasgow, accused the US, Canada and Australia of 'rank hypocrisy'. 'These countries are single-handedly undermining efforts to curtail global emissions and ignoring their responsibility to phase out fossil fuels rapidly and justly.' He said it was the poorest and most vulnerable who were suffering. 'Only the colonial mindset of political leaders in rich countries can make the brutal calculation that the interest of fossil fuel giants and their billions in profit is more important than the lives of people who are overwhelmingly black, brown and poor.' Together these projects would produce 646bn tonnes of CO2 emissions, the study says, swallowing the world's entire carbon budget. More than 60% of these schemes are already operating. Kuhne, the director of the Leave it in the Ground Initiative, said in the first instance, the 40% of projects that had not yet started production must be stopped if the world was to avoid sliding ever more quickly towards catastrophe, adding they should be a prominent focus of the global climate protest movement in the months and years ahead. 'The oil and gas industry is continuing to plan these huge projects, even in the face of a burning planet. The ambitious targets of the Paris agreement were apparently not enough to make them question their business case. These carbon bombs are the single biggest indicator that we are not trying hard enough.' The study is based on data from Rystad Energy but, rather than focusing on total barrels, it identifies the mega projects potentially responsible for the biggest emissions. According to the research, the US is the leading source of potential emissions. Its 22 carbon bombs include conventional drilling and fracking, and span the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico to the foothills of the Front Range in Colorado to the Permian basin. Together they have the potential to emit 140bn tonnes of CO2, almost four times more than the entire world emits each year. Saudi Arabia is the second biggest potential emitter after the US, with 107bn tonnes, followed by Russia, Qatar, Iraq, Canada, China and Brazil. Australia, widely condemned by international leaders as a laggard in addressing the climate crisis, ranks 16th.  Robyn Churnside, a Ngarluma elder on the Burrup peninsula in remote north-west Australia, has been fighting fossil fuel and mining developments since the 1970s. She is part of a campaign trying to stop Woodside's US$12bn Scarborough gas project, one of the biggest fossil fuel developments in the country in a decade. Churnside said dissenting Indigenous voices were too often ignored when decisions were made about new oil and gas infrastructure that could lock in emissions for decades and desecrate culturally significant sites, which in some cases had stood for tens of thousands of years. 'It's about time the world listened to First Nations people because we have been here a long, long time,' she said. 'Our spirit in this land will never rest. It needs protection.' Prof Kevin Anderson, from the Tyndall Centre of Climate Research, University of Manchester and Uppsala University, Sweden, said the scale of planned production in the face of all the evidence suggested big oil and its political supporters either did not believe the climate science or thought their extreme wealth could somehow protect them and their children from the devastating consequences. 'Either the scientists have spent 30 years working on this issue and have got it all wrong - the big oil CEOs know better - or, behind a veil of concern, they have complete disregard for the more climate vulnerable communities, typically poor, people of colour and far away from their lives. Equally worrying, they are disinterested in their own children's future.' When BP reported its quarterly earnings in a presentation to financial institutions in February, one analyst said he 'really enjoyed the camaraderie and the positivity that you're generating', before asking about the company's cash position. 'We've given you a lovely little chart,' said Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief financial officer. 'Certainly, it's possible that we're getting more cash than we know what to do with. For now, I'm going to be conservative and manage the company as if it's $40 [a barrel] oil. Anything we could get above that just helps, obviously.' At the time, the oil price exceeded $90; today it is $106.  The oil industry is awash with cash. The money companies have belongs to shareholders, including pension funds, or in the case of national oil companies, to governments and, in theory at least, citizens. But the investment plans of the biggest oil companies are sharply at odds with the goal of halting the climate crisis. Data obtained by the Guardian from the thinktank Carbon Tracker shows a dozen of the world's biggest companies are on track to commit a collective $387m dollars a day of capital expenditure to exploiting oil and gas fields through to 2030. A significant portion of this is for maintaining production at existing projects - some oil and gas will still be needed as the world weans itself off fossil fuels - but the exact amount is not publicly available. Nonetheless, it is clear that at least a quarter of this investment - $103m a day - is for oil and gas that cannot be burned if the worst impacts of the climate crisis are to be avoided, money that could instead be spent ramping up clean energy. Even more worryingly, the companies have developed further project options that might lead them to spend an additional $84m a day that would not even be compatible with a devastating 2.7C of global heating. The world's governments agreed in the Paris climate accord to limit global heating to well below 2C, and pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5C. For the latter, stricter goal, no new oil and gas projects are possible. The Carbon Tracker data, compiled in September, uses a temperature of 1.65C to represent the well below 2C target and finds that 27% of the companies' projected investments are incompatible with this. ExxonMobil has the largest of these climate-busting investment plans at $21m a day through to 2030, followed by Petrobras ($15m), Chevron and ConocoPhillips (both $12m), and Shell ($8m). In terms of the most dangerous investments - those that could help drive temperatures beyond 2.7C - Gazprom accounts for $17m a day of this, ExxonMobil $12m, Shell $11m and PetroChina $9m. If governments act on the scientific advice to rapidly reduce carbon emissions by boosting clean energy and cutting fossil fuel burning, the companies would have to write off these colossal sums as losses, hitting shareholders, pension funds and public finances. If governments do not act, the companies could cash in as the world burns. Overall, the international oil companies are making the biggest bets, with almost 40% of their projected investments incompatible with 1.65C. ExxonMobil is particularly high, at 56%. The national oil company average is 17%, although 56% of Petrobras's planned capital expenditure is incompatible with 1.65C. 'Companies that continue to develop projects based on business-as-usual demand are betting on the failure of policy action on climate and underestimating the disruptive potential of new technologies, such as renewables and battery storage,' said Mike Coffin at Carbon Tracker. 'Such projects are either not needed or they lead to warming well in excess of Paris goals.' A separate recent analysis based on Rystad Energy data from April, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, found that 20 of the world's biggest oil and gas companies remained on course to spend huge sums - $932bn - by the end of 2030 developing new oil and gas fields. Freeing the world from the grip of fossil fuels is made far harder by huge ongoing subsidies for the fuels, making them far cheaper than their true cost when the damage they cause is included - especially air pollution, which kills 7 million people a year. The G20 group of leading economies pledged in 2009 to phase out the subsidies but little has been achieved. Hundreds of billions of dollars in direct financial support is received by the producers and consumers of fossil fuels every year - but they benefit from far larger subsidies by not paying for the harm burning fossil fuels causes. When the damage from the climate crisis and air pollution is accounted for, the fossil fuel subsidies reach $6tn a year, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Guardian analysis shows this is equivalent to $11m a minute globally, $4m a minute in China and more than $1m in the US. Guardian analysis of more detailed IMF data shows drivers in the US, Canada and Australia, along with Saudi Arabia, are the world's biggest beneficiaries of subsidies for road fuels, with some governments under pressure to increase these during the current energy crisis. The per capita subsidy for petrol and diesel across the population of Saudi Arabia was more than $1,000 a year in 2020. In the US, the road fuel subsidy per capita is $644 and about $500 in both Canada and Australia. Japan and Germany also appear in the top 10 of the road fuel analysis, which focused on the 54 large countries with more than 25 million people and that account for 90% of global population and subsidies. The UK per capita subsidy for road fuels was only $10 a year, indicating taxes on petrol and diesel in 2020 were close to the level of the damage burning the fuels causes. The US is also high on the list of the biggest per capita subsidies for all fossil fuels with $2,000 a year, behind only Saudi Arabia ($4,550) and Russia ($3,560). After these countries, only Iran ($1815) is ahead of Australia ($1730) and Canada ($1690). 'Taking the Paris agreement seriously requires a rapid shift away from fossil fuels,' said Simon Black, a climate economist at the IMF. 'Getting fossil fuel prices right will help enormously in accelerating this transition.' The shift from burning oil and gas cannot happen overnight, and a declining amount will still need to be burned during the transition to a net zero emissions global economy in 2050. The question is whether companies and governments are moving fast enough. The Guardian wrote to the oil and gas companies named in its analysis and asked for their response. 'Under the IEA net zero emissions scenario, and all Paris-aligned scenarios, all energy sources remain important through 2050, and oil and natural gas remain essential components of the energy mix,' said a spokesperson for ExxonMobil.  However, the role of oil and gas would be vastly reduced in 2050, and the IEA said: 'Beyond projects already committed as of 2021, there are no new oil and gas fields approved for development [in our net zero scenario].' ExxonMobil planned to invest more than $15bn on initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions over the next six years, the spokesperson said, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels. The company aimed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 but only from its own operations, not the fuels it sold, therefore covering only a small fraction of the emissions from the oil and gas it sells. A spokesperson for Shell cited recent company statements: 'As a result of [our] planned level of capital investment, we expect a gradual decline of about 1-2% a year in total oil production through to 2030, including divestments.' 'By 2025, Shell expects its expenditure on [low and zero-carbon] products and services across its businesses will have increased to around 50% of its total expenditure,' a recent report by the firm states. In 2022, the proportion is expected to be more than 35%. In 2021, 'Shell achieved its annual investment targets in renewables and energy solutions of $2bn-3bn', the report says. ConocoPhillips also cited a recently published net zero emissions plan: 'Our goal is to support an orderly transition that matches supply to demand and focuses on returns on, and of, capital while safely and responsibly delivering affordable energy.'  The document states that profits from oil and gas projects are significantly higher than from investments in renewable energy. ConocoPhillips has allocated $200m in 2022 to reduce emissions from its operations. To reduce emissions from the burning of the fossil fuels it supplies, the company advocates an 'economy-wide price on carbon that would help shift consumer demand from high-carbon to low-carbon energy sources'. 'Petrobras plans its investments considering that the Paris agreement will be successful and global temperature will be kept below 2degC,' a spokesperson for the company said. 'Oil will remain important in the coming decades, even in accelerated transition scenarios.' The spokesperson said the IEA's scenario for 1.65C indicated some investment in upstream projects was needed. 'We are planning for highly resilient assets competitive in scenarios aligned with Paris due to their low production cost and low emissions. Petrobras is following its strategy of maximising the value of its portfolio, [with 99% of the investment on exploration] focusing on deepwater and ultra-deepwater assets.' TotalEnergies pointed to its recent sustainability report, which it said 'showed our stakeholders that we are already on the right track'. The company has a target of a 30% cut in emissions from oil and gas sales by 2030 and to increase the proportion of its energy sales that are renewable from 9% in 2021 to 20% in 2030. Saudi Aramco and Eni responded to the Guardian but declined to comment. The other companies did not respond to the Guardian's request. The Guardian's investigation has provided an answer to the question of how great a danger the plans of oil and gas companies pose to the climate. But there is another set of questions, those for politicians and governments, that will ultimately affect the course of the climate emergency. Will the world's governments act to close the book on the oil companies' giant climate gamble? Will richer countries, historically most responsible for emissions, support a just transition for developing countries on the frontline of the escalating crisis? Would strong, immediate action lead to a financial crash, as billions of dollars are wiped off the value of some of the world's biggest companies? Or will more steady but concerted action wean us off fossil fuels rapidly, close the oil companies' cash machine and lead us into a clean energy future with a liveable climate? Only time will tell. But, unlike oil and gas, time is in very short supply. 'The world is in a race against time,' said Guterres. 'It is time to end fossil fuel subsidies and stop the expansion of oil and gas exploration.' Reflecting on the war in Ukraine, he said: 'Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use. This is madness. Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.'

The official KCNA news agency said six people had died, adding that one of them had tested positive for the highly transmissible Omicron variant. It said 187,800 people were being 'isolated and treated' after a fever of unidentified origin spread in the country since late April. About 350,000 people had shown signs of fever, including 18,000 who newly reported such symptoms on Tuesday alone, KCNA said, adding that 162,200 of them treated so far. The news agency did not specify how many had tested positive for Covid-19. Confirmation of North Korea's first Covid-19 death came after the regime said it was imposing 'maximum emergency measures' to address an outbreak in the capital, Pyongyang. Experts believe none - or very few - of the country's 26 million people have been vaccinated, and there are growing fears that a significant outbreak would quickly overwhelm the country's poorly equipped health services North Korea has so far shunned offers of Covid vaccines from China and Russia, and via the World Health Organization's Covax scheme, apparently because administering the jabs would require outside monitoring. Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said Beijing had offered North Korea help in dealing with the outbreak. The US has no immediate plans to share Covid-19 vaccines with North Korea, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday. Lina Yoon, senior Korea researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the regime's admission that the virus was spreading was 'extremely concerning'. 'Most North Koreans are chronically malnourished and unvaccinated, there are barely any medicines left in the country, and the health infrastructure is incapable to deal with this pandemic,' Yoon said. 'The international community should offer medicine for Covid-19 related symptoms, Covid-19 anti-viral medicines, and provide vaccines and all necessary infrastructure for vaccine preservation, including fridges, generators and gasoline.' The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, ordered a nationwide lockdown on Thursday, calling the outbreak the 'gravest national emergency'. But it wasn't clear how strictly the measures were being enforced. An Associated Press photographer on the South Korean side of the border reported seeing dozens of people working in fields or walking on footpaths at a North Korean border town - an indication that the lockdown doesn't require people to stay home or that it exempts farm workers. On Friday, Kim - who on Thursday had been photographed briefly wearing a mask - visited the state emergency epidemic prevention headquarters and 'learned about the nationwide spread of Covid-19',' KCNA said. 'It is the most important challenge and supreme tasks facing our party to reverse the immediate public health crisis situation at an early date,' it added. North Korea had insisted it had not recorded a single Covid case since it closed its borders at the start of the pandemic more than two years ago. That move cut off trade with China and inflicted more damage on an economy already battered by natural disaster and UN sanctions imposed in response to its nuclear and missile tests. While some experts said North Korea's public acknowledgment of Covid cases and deaths could indicate it was seeking outside help, it continued to defy international sanctions with the launch on Friday of what appeared to be three ballistic missiles towards the sea off its east coast. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the regime's public acknowledgment of coronavirus cases meant 'the public health situation must be serious'. But he added: 'This does not mean North Korea is suddenly going to be open to humanitarian assistance and take a more conciliatory line toward Washington and Seoul.'", "5139e60bb782288df1e13c987555c912a5b560b81122f102884618d4": "In the aftermath of the leaked supreme court document fortelling the end to federal abortion protections, California geared up to fight. 'California will not stand idly by', the state's governor and legislative leaders said in a joint statement. As in other liberal-leaning states, officials and abortion providers vowed to ramp up abortion protections and turn California into an abortion safe haven. Already, no other state does more to protect abortion access. The right to an abortion in California is guaranteed in statute and by the sweeping personal privacy rights enshrined in the state constitution. California health insurance plans cover the cost of an abortion for low-income residents, and the state has rejected waiting period requirements and most restrictions on the practice. But even in the state with the best abortion protections in the US, abortions have long been inaccessible for many - especially those living in rural, conservative areas. Forty percent of California counties have no clinics providing abortions. Many people still have to travel far to get the appropriate care, or struggle to afford abortions, while language barriers and a lack of up-to-date information can make it difficult to find help. Advocates say that the millions of dollars state leaders are promising for abortion care and extended legal protections are a start. But even more may be needed to care for those living within the state, and the thousands coming from afar. 'As more and more people come in from out of state seeking abortions, it's going to put more pressure on a system that's already strained,' said Laura Jimenez, the executive director of California Latinas for Reproductive Justice. Across the country, blue states seeking to become abortion sanctuaries are facing similar challenges. Even as Democrat-controlled legislatures from coast to coast convey millions into abortion funds, advocates are unclear on just how much money and resources will be required by abortion clinics and services that are already overextended. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights group, about 43% of Massachusetts counties had no abortion clinics, and 13% of Massachusetts women lived in those counties. In Vermont, 64% counties had no clinics, and about 38% of Vermont women lived in those counties. Jennifer Lopez, who lives in Visalia in California's agricultural Central Valley, had to drive north over county lines to get a simple medication abortion. (The Guardian is withholding her last name because she worries about backlash in her community.) 'When you drive into Visalia from other parts of California, it's like you're going back in time,' said Lopez, 36. Visalia has a small Planned Parenthood clinic, but it doesn't provide abortion care. An effort by Planned Parenthood to expand recently inspired furor among conservative groups, and a public hearing on the proposal to build a clinic that would provide abortions was postponed several times this year over the controversy. Lopez, who works at a domestic violence shelter, said she considers herself exceptionally lucky. Many of the clients she works with lack access to transportation or funding to travel for abortion care. 'This isn't a new problem,' said Jessica Pinckney, executive director of Access Reproductive Justice, an organisation that helps secure financing and organize travel, lodging and childcare for people seeking abortions. About a quarter of those seeking help from Access come from out-of-state, including from Texas, which enacted a near-total ban on abortions last year, Pinckney said. But the organisation has also helped many coming from states like Nevada - where abortion rights are protected, but clinics are sparse - and in remote regions within California. 'We have helped folks in rural parts of northern California travel four or five hours to the Bay Area to access abortions,' Pinckney said, adding that the few abortion clinics in the rural regions are unable to care for patients with complicated abortions or those who are farther along in their pregnancies. Although a shortage of abortion clinics is felt most acutely in rural parts of California, people living in underserved parts of big cities can struggle to find care as well. Amelia Torres, 25, said she had to travel from the South Central neighbourhood of Los Angeles, where she lives, all the way across the city to Beverly Hills in order to get a surgical abortion. Torres, thinking she was about five weeks along when she found out she was pregnant, initially sought a medication abortion at a nearby clinic. But the medication didn't work, she said. When she went in for a follow-up appointment, it turned out she was about 18 weeks along and would need a surgical abortion, which more than half of abortion clinics in the state aren't equipped to perform. She didn't have a car, but her partner was ultimately able to take time off work to drive her to the appointment, and her family was able to take care of her two daughters while she was being seen. 'I was lucky,' she said. Though some in her family tried to dissuade her from terminating her pregnancy, they ultimately supported her choice. 'But without that support, the money, the transportation,' she said, 'even here in California getting an abortion can be very difficult.' In addition to a lack of providers, language barriers and a lack of information can make it impossible for many to find abortion care, or the resources to help fund such care. 'There's always been an enormous stigma around seeking information about abortions,' said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. Advocates in recent weeks have become increasingly concerned about the spread of misinformation that implies abortions aren't legal in California. The fear of criminalization or deportation may also keep California immigrants who lack legal status or are in the country with a temporary protected status from seeking abortions or public resources to help pay for care, they say. Late-term abortions, once the fetus is viable, are still restricted in California and can be prosecuted, as can abortions performed outside a medical setting. 'This might include a situation where there's been rape and incest, and the person doesn't realize that they are pregnant until much later in the pregnancy,' said Upadhyay. 'These are extreme situations that apply only to a small number of patients.' California could also do more to protect those who miscarry, or attempt self abortions, advocates said. Just this week, a district attorney in California's conservative Kings county dropped the prosecution of a woman who spent four years in prison for giving birth to a stillborn child after using drugs. 'California is definitely a leader in passing legislation to protect people seeking abortions,' said Jimenez. 'But there's still some work to be done in the decriminalisation of self-managed abortions' And then there's the cost. Even with insurance, Lopez had to pay about $550 out-of-pocket for each of the two abortions she sought over the past three years. 'I managed to pay, but it was a big chunk out of my savings,' she said. The median out-of-pocket cost of a first-trimester for those without insurance in California is about $700. One resident of the Central Valley city of Dinuba, whom the Guardian is not naming because they fear stigma from their family, said they ended up paying about $1,000 for a first-trimester medication abortion last year because concerns about an ectopic pregnancy required them to seek multiple follow-up appointments. California recently passed legislation eliminating co-pays for abortion care, and the state already covers abortion costs for those enrolled in the state's public insurance option for low-income residents. The governor this week announced an additional $57m to prepare for an influx of people from other states seeking abortions in California, including $40m for abortion providers offering care to low-income patients without health insurance, and $15m to help community-based organizations with sexual and reproductive health outreach and education. The funds 'will go a long way' to protect abortion access 'for those who live here and those who may be forced to seek care here', said Jodi Hicks, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California. Researchers and advocates say that telemedicine clinics, which consult with patients online and mail abortion pills to clients, could be another way to quickly expand abortion access. Telemedicine services typically charge about $300 for a simple service, and often don't take public or private health insurance due to the logistical complications of securing reimbursements for care delivered across county lines, said Mai Fleming, a physician and researcher at UCSF who also works with an online abortion clinic. The services aren't right for everyone and infeasible for many in rural California who lack internet access, but they still could be a solution for some who live in areas without clinics, she said. 'Going forward, I think expanding telehealth could be key to expanding access in rural parts of the state,' she said, adding that California should work to make it easier for online clinics to accept insurance. Often, brick-and-mortar abortion clinics shy away from offering telehealth abortion services precisely because of how insurance reimbursements work. Public and private insurance services reimburse at higher rates for in-person appointments that include an ultrasound, which is often medically unnecessary - leading clinics to require patients to come in person in order to recoup operational costs, Upadhyay said. In an attempt to ramp up the number of healthcare workers available to perform abortions, California and some other states are also moving to allow nurse practitioners to provide abortion care without the supervision of a physician. And ultimately, more primary care providers and family clinics could start providing abortion care, Fleming said - though as it stands, primary care and family medicine residencies still aren't required to train doctors to provide abortion care. 'Despite its very progressive laws, hurdles and barriers to abortion care have existed for years,' she said. But now, especially, she added, 'it's important to remember that abortion, legality, abortion rights, don't necessarily equal abortion justice or abortion access.'", "2f8a873b2f86f8c7f16e47bec70e4fac74b77e90745f03d0a3552c9d": "Cuban rescue workers have recovered the body of the 45th and last person believed missing after an explosion blew the sides off a luxury hotel in historic Havana. The blast on 6 May at the five-star Hotel Saratoga - a block from the city's famous Capitol building, in a renovated area of Havana popular with tourists - left more than 100 people trapped, killed or injured. Fifteen remain hospitalised. Officials say a gas leak caused the explosion. Luis Carlos Guzman, chief of Cuba's firefighting corps, told reporters at the site of the blast that the woman whose body had been recovered, believed to be a waitress at the hotel, was 'as of now, the last missing person'. The hotel was in the process of being renovated after a two-year closure due to the pandemic, and had been due to open this week. Most of those killed or injured were Cuban staff or passersby, including a Spanish tourist and a pregnant woman. Several children from a nearby school were injured and four were killed. Shortly after the recovery of what was believed to be the last body, the Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, declared a period of national mourning. For days, rescue workers have sifted through piles of debris at the base of the hotel's neo-classical style building, which is more than a century old. Experts have begun to consider the fate of the 19th-century former warehouse that was converted into a hotel early in the last century. Roberto Enriquez, a spokesman for the military-owned Gaviota tourism company that operates the Saratoga, said experts' initial estimates were that 80% of the hotel was damaged by Friday's explosion, which hurled tonnes of concrete chunks into busy streets and seriously harmed neighbouring structures. He said that when rescue efforts finished, authorities would look more deeply into what to do with the ruin. Also badly damaged was Cuba's most important Baptist church, which is next door to the Saratoga. The explosion shook the church and shattered the 19th-century dome. Concrete plunged from walls, and wood and glass showered down from the windows. Parts of the upper floors collapsed at the building, which houses not only Calvary Baptist Church but a seminary and the denomination's headquarters for western Cuba. The famous, elegant building now known as the Teatro Marti was just a few years old when, in 1887, Baptists began holding services across the street on a corner in Old Havana that had once held a circus. Cuba was still a Spanish colony and its Capitol building - modelled on the US Capitol - would not be built nearby for a few decades yet.", "48017165010e12ca67cae67b2140f2161c8b41cee42ede6a2ace361d": "The 20-year manhunt for one of the world's most brutal killers has come to a decisive end in an overgrown cemetery outside Harare. The body of Protais Mpiranya, the former commander of the Rwandan presidential guard indicted for genocide, lay buried under a stone slab bearing a false name, which UN investigators tracked down and identified with the help of a critical lead found on a confiscated computer: the hand-drawn design for Mpiranya's tombstone. His body was exhumed last month at the request of UN investigators, and Mpiranya's identity was confirmed by DNA analysis on Tuesday. Serge Brammertz, the UN prosecutor who led the hunt, said he was the last of the major fugitives and finding his body 'provides the solace of knowing that he cannot cause further harm'. The man charged with overseeing the slaughter of thousands of Rwandans, and abetting the murder of many more, died in Harare in October 2006 of a heart attack brought on by tuberculosis, at the age of 50. But his death, like much of his life, had been swathed in secrecy by his family and supporters. Mpiranya had been living in Zimbabwe under an assumed identity for four years, despite its government's insistence that he was not in the country. The investigation that followed his trail all the way to the grave in Granville cemetery on the southern edge of Harare found he had arrived on a Zimbabwean military plane and had been in frequent contact during his stay with Zimbabwean officials in the then president Robert Mugabe's regime who were well aware of his identity as a valued ally in the second Congo war of 1998-2003. 'That the Zimbabweans, at least elements of the authorities, knew he was in Harare is obvious,' said a senior official involved in the investigation. 'He was even seen meeting with Zimbabwean officials. Of course he was trying to hide his identity from the public, but the entire reason he went to Zimbabwe is because of his relationships there.' The Guardian has asked the Zimbabwean government for comment. As a fugitive, Mpiranya had outlasted the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, established in 1994 to bring the genocidaires to justice after the genocide that killed up to 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. It had indicted him on eight counts, including genocide and crimes against humanity, but was unable to find him to make him stand trial. After the tribunal closed in 2015, a 'residual mechanism' was set up to wrap up old cases, and part of that mechanism was a small tracking team under Brammertz's command as chief prosecutor. At 7am on 7 February, members of the team arrived at the cemetery, where the graves were invisible beneath head-high grass. It took two and a half hours to find what they were looking for: a black headstone in memory of a Sambao Ndume whose date of birth matched Mpiranya's, 30 May 1956. A team member recalled the discovery of the grave: 'There was that moment when my colleague called out: 'Found it!' And we all just stood there looking at it. It was exactly as we thought it would be,' he said. 'All that hard work, the ups and the downs, it had led to this moment.' The French inscription on the tombstone read: 'Here rests forever one who loved his fatherland, his people and his family, more than his own life.' Below that, a crude depiction of a warrior with bow and arrow was carved with the message: 'Dad RIP'. The path that had led the trackers to the grave was long, convoluted and dotted with dead ends. There were supposedly eyewitness reports from across Africa from people claiming to have seen him, and until late last year the investigators believed he was probably still alive, hiding out in Zimbabwe with his fellow combatants from the Congo war. By May 2020, Mpiranya was the last major fugitive among the 93 accused indicted by the ICTR, and the most wanted war crimes suspect in the world. As head of the Rwandan presidential guard in 1994, according to his indictment, he had given his men a kill list of prominent Tutsis and orders to kill their families too. He armed and trained the notorious Interahamwe Hutu militia, responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths. And with the signal for the bloodletting to begin, the shooting down of the plane carrying the country's president, Juvenal Habyarimana, on 5 April 1994, he sent his men to set up roadblocks at which Tutsis were massacred. Soldiers from the presidential guard murdered the prime minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, a moderate Hutu, and mutilated her body. The 10 lightly armed Belgian soldiers who had been sent to protect her were shot and hacked to death with machetes. After the fall of the Hutu regime in July 1994, Mpiranya fled across Africa, spending four years in Cameroon until it became inhospitable for genocidaire fugitives. He moved on to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), fighting with Hutu forces and Zimbabwean troops on behalf of the country's president Laurent Kabila, against the Rwandan army, in what became known as the second Congo war. Zimbabwean officers saw the former commander as a cut above most of the Congolese troops they were fighting alongside . 'He developed a lot of relationships with these guys during the war,' a senior official in the prosecutor's office said. 'They respected him. He was a good commander, a professional, someone who listened, asked questions and took decisions. He was very security conscious. So he impressed the Zimbabweans when others they were working with did not.' So when Mpiranya was first indicted in September 2002, his friends and admirers in Zimbabwe helped spirit him across borders. According to witnesses, he flew from Mbuji-Mayi in central DRC to Harare on a Zimbabwean military plane. Mpiranya brought a small entourage of Hutu commanders with him and, using a fake identity, set up a small transport business with two large vans, bought most likely with proceeds from Congolese diamonds. He was better at giving orders than doing business. The venture floundered, and over the four years in Zimbabwe, Mpiranya's standard of living crumbled. Starting off in a substantial villa in the first year, the family had to downgrade to an apartment in the same area and then another in a more down-at-heel neighbourhood. They stopped hiring conductors for the buses and a family member had to do the work themselves. Then both buses were in accidents and there was no money to repair them. Much of the rest of his assets were wiped out by Zimbabwean high inflation in those years. When Mpiranya fell sick with tuberculosis, he had no money left to pay for his medical care and his wife in the UK had to take on more work to send funds. Filling in the forms for hospital admission, he used a new identity, Sambao Ndume, the name he would be buried under. The UN investigators believe his family and friends covered up the death so as not to dent morale among the Hutu forces in DRC - and so as not to expose themselves to scrutiny. The tracking team found several had secured safe haven in the UK and EU with bogus asylum claims. The tribunal tracking team spent the time chasing wispy leads around Africa, provided by informants either seeking to cover up Mpiranya's death, or looking to make money, or both.'The family and his associates deliberately concealed for the last two decades his presence in Harare and his death,' Brammertz told the Guardian. 'The investigative file was filled with information that he was quite active, with businesses and associates in several countries. My predecessors, and perhaps even myself at the beginning, focused more on those leads.' Over the past few years, the tracking team went back over the entire investigation, reviewing the databases, interviewing and re-interviewing witnesses, stripping out tips and speculation, and the investigators' own possible bias, back to the last fact in Mpiranya's life they knew for sure: he was in the DRC in 2002. They reconstructed every known detail of his life, his mindset and connections. The breakthrough came last September with the seizure of a computer and other material in a raid in a European country (which the Guardian is not allowed to identify). Combing through a mass of data, they came across emails with veiled references to 'the one who has a passed' and the 'old man'. Then they cross-checked with the travel of some of Mpiranya's relatives, from visa stamps sent by partner governments, and found them converging on Zimbabwe in October 2006. Sifting through hundreds of digital pictures, they found photos of a funeral including those of the body laid out for the mourners. It looked like Mpiranya and was dressed in a suit that the investigators later found in the grave. Finally, they found the photo of a hand-drawn picture of a gravestone, sent by a close relative, and realised it was a commission for the stone carvers of Harare. If they could find a stone like that, they could find the body. After years of stalling the search, the Zimbabwean authorities agreed to allow the body of the man calling himself Sambao Ndume to be dug up. On 27 April, the trackers, a UN pathologist, and three Zimbabwean detectives gathered at the grave as the sun rose. About 20 riot police had been sent along as well, torpedoing any hopes that it could be done quietly. The conspicuous police presence drew a small crowd of curious local residents. The gravediggers worked their way down to the coffin with spades, and then the pathologist took over, climbing down into the grave to take a careful sample, without disturbing the rest of the body, with a deference Mpiranya had not accorded to his multitude of victims. Prosecutors are still looking for five more indictees, and Brammertz believes the discovery of Mpiranya's body will increase the pressure on the governments of other countries, where the last ageing fugitives are thought to be hiding. But Mpiranya was the last of the main figures of the Rwandan genocide to be accounted for, although he had succeeded in avoiding a trial. 'Of course the goal is to arrest fugitives,' Brammertz said. 'But we need to account for them, one way or the other. First, because as they say themselves, survivors and victims want a final answer. 'And second, to say this person is dead means they can't cause further harm, and they aren't living this nice life as a fugitive somewhere while the victims try to rebuild their lives. 'And, of course, for the UN and our mandate,' he added, 'we have to demonstrate our determination and that we go all the way.'", "571f1dc9db17d45a64f09e027bd070559e76a4794fb194f615e98d63": "Thousands of women in England and Wales with fibroids are to be offered a new tablet to ease their symptoms as an alternative to injections or surgery. Fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in or around the womb. About one in three women develop them at some point in their life. They most often occur in those aged between 30 and 50. Symptoms can include prolonged and heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain and pressure, and fertility problems. There are currently limited long-term treatment options. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has recommended a new treatment - relugolix with estradiol and norethisterone acetate, also called Ryeqo - be offered on the NHS in final draft guidance. About 4,500 women will be eligible. Taken once a day as a single tablet, comprising 40mg relugolix, 1mg estradiol and 0.5mg norethisterone acetate, the treatment is another option for women with moderate to severe symptoms, Nice said. It works by reducing the release of hormones that control oestrogen and progesterone production by the ovaries. Relugolix with estradiol and norethisterone acetate offers an effective alternative to surgery and injectable gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, which also work to reduce the production of oestrogen and progesterone in the ovaries. Clara Amfo, the BBC Radio 1 DJ, has previously spoken about her experience of living with fibroids. She told Radio 1's Life Hacks: 'A lot of people don't know what they are. So they are basically non-cancerous growths that can appear on the womb. 'The blessing is they are non-cancerous, which is a plus, but they still cause a lot of problems around fertility, enjoyment of sexy time, with your digestive system, with your urinary system, heavy periods. 'I developed anaemia because my periods were very heavy. I was losing a lot of blood because of them.' Amfo recently had surgery to remove six large fibroids. 'The recovery was so tough,' she said. 'It was keyhole surgery but it was still invasive.' Helen Knight, interim director of medicines evaluation at the Nice Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said fibroids could have a 'profound effect' on women because of their ability to cause 'many debilitating symptoms'. 'This treatment has the potential to improve quality of life,' she said. 'As well as effectively reducing symptoms, it can be taken at home and is therefore more convenient than the injectable treatment, given in a hospital setting. 'It can also be used long term, which could mean improved and sustained symptom relief, it is well-tolerated, and it will mean thousands of women can avoid invasive surgery which always carries some risk.' Maria Caulfield, the minister for women's health, said: 'Around one in three women can suffer from uterine fibroids at some point in their life - the symptoms can have a profound impact on women's health and lead to infertility if untreated. 'So this is another groundbreaking step forward to not only improve women's quality of life and reduce symptoms, but to give them greater choice in the medication available and options for alternative, less invasive treatment.'", "0b15263a8624b324f116371c4690289c0ee105f1825fa2b80eb1ce68": "Eleven people were killed and dozens were rescued after a boat capsized near Puerto Rico on Thursday, authorities said. It wasn't immediately clear how many people were aboard the boat when it turned over, said US coast guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad. He said a 'mass rescue effort' was still underway. 'We're looking to rescue as many people as we can and find as many survivors as we can,' he said. At least eight Haitians were taken to the hospital, although the nationalities of all those aboard the boat were not immediately known. Authorities said people aboard the boat were believed to be migrants. The incident was the latest in a string of capsizings across the region as people from Haiti and the Dominican Republic flee violence and poverty in their countries. A US Customs and Border Protection helicopter spotted the overturned boat late Thursday morning. 'If not for that, we would not have known about this until someone would have found any sign or received reports from people that their loved ones are missing,' Castrodad said. 'They found them early enough that we were able to coordinate a response.' The boat was spotted more than 11 miles (18 km) north of the uninhabited island of Desecheo, which is off Puerto Rico's west coast. The US coast guard said those rescued were 20 men and 11 women. The capsizing comes less than a week after the US coast guard and Dominican navy on Saturday rescued 68 people in the Mona Passage, a treacherous area between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. One woman believed to be from Haiti died, Castrodad said. 'These voyages are dangerous,' Castrodad said. 'They're unsafe, they are grossly overloaded ... (and) no lifesaving equipment. It wouldn't really take much for any of these vessels to capsize.' From October 2021 to March, 571 Haitians and 252 people from the Dominican Republic were detained in waters around Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, according to US Customs and Border Protection. The majority of those Haitians, 348 of them, landed in Puerto Rico's uninhabited Mona Island and were rescued. In fiscal year 2021, 310 Haitians and 354 Dominicans were detained, compared with the 22 Haitians and 313 Dominicans apprehended in fiscal year 2020. Meanwhile, the US coast guard said that in the fiscal year that ended 30 September, it apprehended 1,527 Haitians, 838 Cubans and 742 people from the Dominican Republic in the region, which includes Florida and the Caribbean. Since then, trips of human smuggling boats have only increased, authorities say. In January, the coast guard searched for at least 38 people missing off Florida's coast after a suspected human smuggling boat that had left the Bahamas capsized in a storm. A sole survivor was reported. Hundreds of Haitians have arrived in Florida alone in recent months after swimming ashore. Haiti is struggling with a surge in gang-related violence that has killed dozens of people, including women and children, and caused thousands of families to flee their homes. Kidnappings also have spiked, including those of eight Turkish citizens who on Sunday were forced off a bus they had boarded in the Dominican Republic. Kidnappings in the country of more than 11 million people have increased 180% and homicides are up 17% in the past year, according to the United Nations, which last week expressed concern over 'the rapid deterioration of security and human rights' in Haiti. Many have criticized the administration of US President Joe Biden for deporting more than 20,000 Haitians in recent months given the country's deepening turmoil.

The school, located in Nigeria's northwestern state of Sokoto, was immediately closed down following the attack. Two suspects were arrested in connection with the murder of the student, who was identified as Deborah Samuel, said a spokesperson for the Sokoto state command. 'There is a WhatsApp group being used by the students, and her Muslim colleague student posted an Islamic piece. She criticised the posting,' said one of the witnesses, who declined to be named. 'She composed an audio that contains blasphemous comments on the prophet of Islam and posted in the group. That is what triggered everything.' School security and police attempted to rescue the girl but were overwhelmed by the students, the witnesses said. 'Police have fired teargas on the students ... then began firing shots in the sky to disperse the students, but they resisted,' said Summayya Usman Inname, a student in her second year. 'The police sacrificed the lady after the students began throwing sticks and stones at them, then the students used stones and sticks to beat the lady. After being beaten, she was set on fire.' The Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto said in a statement that it had closed the college indefinitely 'following today's early morning student rampage'. The Sokoto sultanate council condemned the 'unfortunate happenings ... that led to the loss of life of a female student at the institution'. Nigeria is divided into a largely Christian south and mostly Muslim north. Incidents such as this are very rare. In 2007, Muslim pupils at a secondary school in the northeast beat a teacher to death after accusing her of desecrating the Qur'an.", "e3eb2fc29320f260df085e7839f476d39226d8b82014f69fff95d505": "Shireen Abu Aqleh, the Palestinian American journalist shot dead during an Israeli army operation, has been honoured with a full state memorial in the West Bank city of Ramallah. At least 5,000 people lined the streets on Thursday as her coffin, draped in the Palestinian flag, was driven through the city and the Qalandia checkpoint en route to St Joseph hospital nearer her home in occupied East Jerusalem. Her funeral will be held in the holy city on Friday. Attenders brought wreaths of flowers and waved Palestinian flags as the ambulance carrying her body passed by, escorted by a dozen masked gunmen belonging to the Palestinian Fatah movement. Some people threw rose petals while the militants fired into the air, accompanied by chants of 'From Ramallah to Jenin, God have mercy on you, Shireen' and 'The true voice never dies'. The 51-year-old reporter was shot in the head on Wednesday morning in the West Bank city of Jenin during what her colleagues at the scene said was a surprise burst of Israeli fire on a small group of journalists covering an expected Israeli military raid. Video of the incident shows Abu Aqleh was wearing a helmet and body armour clearly marked 'press'. Ali Samodi, a producer for Al Jazeera who was shot in the back, told the Guardian from his hospital bed that contrary to claims made by Israeli officials, there were no gunmen standing near the journalists when they were targeted. 'There were no fighters around, no civilians, nothing. Just the Israeli soldiers and the press. There were many bullets. After I was hit and Shireen was killed, they just kept shooting,' he said. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) initially said its troops shot back after coming under 'massive fire' from militants in Jenin in the northern West Bank. The town is a historical flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the IDF has been conducting near-daily raids there in the wake of a recent wave of terrorist attacks against Israelis, which have left 19 dead. Many of the perpetrators came from the Jenin area. Israeli officials, including the prime minister, Naftali Bennett, initially insisted there was 'a considerable chance that armed Palestinians, who fired wildly, were the ones who brought about the journalist's unfortunate death.' But later on Wednesday the Israeli military chief Lt Gen Aviv Kochavi and the defence minister, Benny Gantz, appeared to back away from those assertions. Gantz conceded it could have been 'the Palestinians who shot her' or fire from 'our side', adding: 'We are not sure how she was killed. We are investigating.' The IDF circulated what it said was a video of militants in Jenin engaged in a gunfight on the morning Abu Aqleh was shot, in which they claimed to have hit a soldier. The footage was challenged by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, which visited the two locations and found from the GPS coordinates that it was impossible for the shooting depicted in the IDF-distributed video to be the same gunfire that hit Abu Aqleh and Samodi. Israel has denied allegations from the Qatar-based Al Jazeera that the journalists were 'intentionally targeted' and Abu Aqleh was 'assassinated in cold blood'. The correspondent's death has led to grief and condemnation across the Palestinian territories and the Middle East. Abu Aqleh was a familiar face to millions, reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in often dangerous circumstances for Al Jazeera's Arabic channel since 1997. In an unusual move, considering Abu Aqleh's reporting was often critical of the Palestinian Authority (PA), but in an indication of the respect for her across Palestinian society, a memorial service for the reporter was held at the Ramallah compound of PA president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Thursday morning. Foreign diplomats, journalists, religious leaders and prominent Palestinian and Arab Israeli politicians were in attendance as Abbas vowed 'this crime should not go unpunished,' adding that the PA held Israel 'completely responsible' for her death and had 'refused and rejected' an Israeli proposal for a joint investigation into the killing. 'We refused a joint investigation because [Israelis] are the criminals and we don't trust them,' he said. 'We will go to the international criminal court to uncover the truth.' The ICC launched an investigation into possible Israeli war crimes over a year ago, although Israel has rejected the probe as biased. Hussein al-Sheikh, a senior aide to Abbas, has rejected an Israeli request to conduct ballistic analysis on the bullet, saying the PA would conduct its own investigation and convey the results 'with high transparency' to Abu Aqleh's family, the US, Qatar and the public. Bennett accused the Palestinians on Thursday of denying Israel 'access to the basic findings required to get to the truth'. He called on the PA not to take 'any steps to disrupt the investigation or to contaminate the investigation process'. The EU has called for an independent inquiry while the US has demanded the killing be 'transparently investigated' - calls echoed by the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet. An initial autopsy and forensic examination were conducted in the West Bank city of Nablus hours after Abu Aqleh's death, but no final conclusions have been disclosed. The journalist's funeral will take place on Friday at a Roman Catholic church in Jerusalem before she is buried in the family plot in the city's Mount Zion cemetery. 'Shireen's killing was a message to the Palestinian people to try and kill our spirit,' said Mufaz Jaba, 38, who attended the memorial procession in Ramallah. 'Instead it's the opposite. Her death has helped unite Palestinian society and reminded the world of how important the Palestinian cause is,' he said.", "2084d22c5aba14b9ece96c09e07ffe4db720556f1fb22941c1872b02": "Extreme fire conditions are continuing to fuel a massive wildfire in northern New Mexico, making it difficult for crews to contain the largest blaze in the US, which grew to  nearly 260,000 acres acres on Thursday. The continued destruction came as a smaller fire broke out in California, destroying more than 20 homes, many of them multimillion-dollar mansions, in the coastal community of Laguna Niguel. New Mexico has seen an explosive start to what is expected to be another devastating fire season across the American west, with parched vegetation and gusty winds fanning flames that have burned for weeks. 'This fire is going to keep growing,' New Mexico officials said in a Thursday morning update, noting that more resources are being deployed to battle the blaze as another red flag warning was issued through the evening. 'The weather has been unfavorable for weeks,' they said. 'This will continue to cause extreme fire behavior and rapid growth, especially to the north.' The fire in California began on Wednesday when strong ocean winds sent embers flying, sparking flames that swept through the dry seaside bluffs and into the community. Though conditions improved overnight, by Thursday morning officials still listed the fire at zero percent containment.  Residents of about 900 houses were under evacuation in coastal California and one firefighter was injured, Orange county officials said. The wildfire has torched about 200 acres. Smoke from the blaze choked nearby cities in Orange county, and air quality officials issued an advisory through Thursday afternoon. Brian Fennessy, chief of the Orange county fire authority, said drought and climate change have combined to make fires that were once easy to contain extremely dangerous for people and property. The California fire was much smaller than the New Mexico blaze, which has destroyed at least 300 homes and other buildings since breaking out early last month. The fire is on track to become the largest in New Mexico's history. Rising temperatures have spurred desiccation throughout the west and drought conditions are only expected to deepen through the hot, dry weeks and months ahead. In its latest report, released on Thursday, the US Drought Monitor classified more than 40% of the west in 'Extreme Drought', up from roughly 35% last week. Nearly 60% of California was also in the category, a sharp jump from just over 40% last week. From New Mexico to Colorado and parts of the midwest, forecasters on Thursday issued red flag warnings of extreme wildfire danger because of low humidity levels, erratic winds and warm temperatures. The same combination of weather conditions have set the stage for spring wildfires across the US that have been more intense than in previous seasons. In New Mexico, the fastest-moving flames in the southern foothills of the Rocky Mountains were headed north-east and away from the area's biggest population center of Taos, a popular tourist destination 40 miles (64 km) south of the state line with Colorado. The winds have made it difficult for aircraft to fly to help firefighters on the ground, but some planes managed to drop retardant on the blaze on Wednesday despite winds gusting in some areas above 45 mph (72 km/h). Some evacuation orders were relaxed along the southern flank of the fire near the town of Las Vegas, New Mexico. Additional crews were on order to join the more than 1,800 personnel fighting the New Mexico fire, and forecasters said weather conditions should improve on Friday. The fire has already burned through a forested landscape, torching homes that have been in families for generations. Officials have predicted that the number of houses burned by the fire will rise dramatically when it is safe to do assessments of areas that are still smoldering. Crews were also battling a smaller New Mexico fire near Los Alamos National Laboratory, a government facility for nuclear research that has been tapped to ramp up production of plutonium components for the US nuclear arsenal. Officials and experts believe the risks for big blazes will continue through the south-west until the summer monsoon. In other areas across the west, where a rainy reprieve is less likely, the threats will continue to grow through the end of the year. The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) has predicted an above-normal fire potential lasting through the spring in areas from the high plains through the south-west. The threats will also linger farther west, into central Oregon and northern California this spring, and will only grow there through the summer and autumn. With the snowpack waning, the agency also noted that historic water sources used for suppression might not be available. 'There will be wetting rains in some areas but overall, it does suggest that it is going to be an active fire season,' Bill Bunting, the chief of forecast operations at the Noaa/NWS Storm Prediction Center, noting that the dangerous combination of strong winds, low relative humidity, and dryness fuels 'the rapid spread and erratic behavior of any fire that gets started'. 'It is just a reminder,' he said, 'you can have dangerous fire conditions any time of the year.'

Sunlight shines through the morning mist. 'Humans,' intones renowned primatologist Dr Jane Goodall. 'What unusual animals we are.' As the camera pans over a closeup shot of a male model's boxer briefs, the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees says, 'It's a big job making our world a better place, but getting started? Well, that's as easy as changing your underwear.' This 30-second ad, for Australian underwear company Boody, is now airing. Billboards from the campaign will soon be erected around Sydney and Melbourne. 'It's interesting,' says Associate Prof Michal Carrington, a researcher in ethical consumption at Melbourne University. 'Because you wouldn't expect Dame Jane Goodall to be fronting a campaign for underwear.' Elliot Midalia, co-managing director of Boody, says: 'We didn't want to just get any influencer or celebrity. 'Jane was the top of our list, and we're so happy that she said yes. We couldn't believe it.' Goodall's fee - a sum Boody are not contractually allowed to disclose - was paid directly to the Jane Goodall Institute. It's not the first time Goodall has appeared in advertising - she has also modelled for Stella McCartney and appeared in commercials for HP.  While the final cut of the commercial shows Goodall surrounded by models, the ad was shot in two parts. Goodall was filmed against a green screen in London, while the rest of the campaign footage was captured in Australia. Then, she was superimposed into the scene. 'She had a laugh about it, made a few jokes about how funny it was that she'd be out there with underwear models around her,' says Roy Leibowitz, one of the campaign's creative directors. 'She's so professional, it just seemed to come easy.' Goodall's outfit in the advertisement was also made by Boody. Midalia says they already had plans to make a turtleneck ('her signature,' as he puts it), but when the institute confirmed she would work with the brand, 'we quickly expedited that'. Carrington describes an endorsement from Goodall as 'significant'. 'Someone like Jane Goodall is not going to be part of any campaign that's going to detract from ... her credibility.' Boody is a B Corp certified business, a 1% for the Planet participant, and manufacture their garments from Forest Stewardship Council-certified bamboo. Midalia describes that ad's message as 'really about sustainability, about getting people to make a switch to an underwear that supports the planet'. While Carrington says the conservation message is important, she questions the efficacy of such a positive approach. 'Pulling my academic hat on,' she says, research suggests that when you want to engage people in an ethical decision, 'no matter what the message, or the cause, you really need to switch people on morally'. She notes that the campaign does not explain the impacts it is trying to address, from the destruction of native forests to the way cotton farming might deplete water resources. The most effective messages, Carrington says, create 'what we call moral shock'. 'This ad campaign doesn't really give that sense of moral shock, or that sense of why ... The sense that people in their own actions are implicated.' On the other hand, Carrington says, 'there is a whole argument going on about how much responsibility a consumer can have'. 'While it's great to see companies taking responsibility themselves and developing [more sustainable] products ... how much responsibility do we want to place on the consumer? 'From a cynical perspective you could say 'Well why isn't there legislation out there to stop the harmful effects of clothing?''

Millions of babies in the US rely on formula, which is the only source of nutrition recommended for infants who are not exclusively breastfed. Here's a look at what's behind the problem and what parents can do: Ongoing supply disruptions and recent safety recalls have combined to leave many pharmacy and supermarket shelves bare. The problems began last year as the Covid-19 pandemic led to disruptions in labor, transportation and raw materials - economy-wide issues that did not spare the formula industry. Inventory was further squeezed by parents stockpiling during lockdowns. Then in February, Abbott Nutrition recalled several major brands of powdered formula and shut down its Sturgis, Michigan, factory when federal officials began investigating four babies who suffered bacterial infections after consuming formula from the facility. Abbott is one of only a handful of companies that produce the vast majority of the US formula supply, so their recall wiped out a large segment of the market. Most formulas contain protein from cow's milk that's been altered to be easier to digest and enhanced with extra nutrients needed for growth and development. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets specific nutritional requirements, including minimum amounts of protein, fat, calcium and a number of vitamins. Formula makers achieve those levels by adding various sugars, oils and minerals. The formulas are designed to mimic breast milk, though studies have repeatedly shown better health outcomes for babies who are breastfed. Health professionals recommend exclusively breastfeeding babies until they are six-months-old. But federal figures show that only one in four are relying solely on breast milk at that age. Mothers face a number of challenges to long-term breastfeeding, including returning to work and finding the time and equipment needed to pump breast milk. About 60% of mothers stop breastfeeding sooner than they had planned, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State and federal laws have been enacted to encourage breastfeeding by requiring break time and accommodations for mothers of infants. Rates of breastfeeding have consistently been lower among Black babies than other groups. About three quarters of Black babies are breast fed only in infancy, below the national average of 84%, according to the CDC. Talk with your pediatrician or call a local food bank to see if they can help locate some options. Experts also recommend checking with smaller stores and pharmacies, which may still have supplies when larger stores run out. Most regular baby formulas contain the same basic ingredients and nutrients, so parents should not hesitate to buy a different brand if they are having trouble finding their regular one. Some infants require specialty formulas due to allergies, digestive problems and other medical conditions. Parents should talk to their doctor if they cannot find those products, which manufacturers usually distribute through pharmacies and clinics. Families that qualify for WIC - a federal program similar to food stamps that pays for about half the formula used in the US - can also contact their local agency. Health officials also warn against buying formula via social media websites or outside of conventional retailers because they could be counterfeit. Many do-it-yourself formula recipes are made from cow's milk and granular sugar that may be difficult for young babies to digest. They also lack the specific vitamins and proteins found in breastmilk and FDA-approved formulas that are needed for basic nutrition. 'Particularly for small babies, many of these formulas and mixtures that are found online don't contain even the most basic nutrient mixes that babies need to survive,' said Dr Steven Abrams, a pediatrician at the University of Texas, Austin. Abrams also stressed that parents should never dilute infant formula. Several national chains have limited the number of containers customers can purchase in stores and online. For CVS and Walgreens, the limit is three per customer. Target limits purchases to four per person when buying online. Amazon said Thursday it is working to keep the products available on its website and monitoring third-party sellers for price-gouging. 'If we identify a price that violates our policy, we remove the offer and take appropriate action with the seller,' a company spokesperson said in a statement. Health regulators recently announced several steps designed to boost supply, including allowing faster importation of formula made overseas. Typically, 98% of baby formula consumed in the US is made domestically, according to federal officials. The FDA is working with Abbott to fix the violations that triggered the shutdown of its Michigan plant, which produces Similac, EleCare and several other leading powdered formulas. The company says its products have not been directly linked to the bacterial infections in children, pointing out that genetic samples collected from its factory did not match those found in several infants who got sick. The Chicago-based company said this week that, pending FDA approval, it could restart manufacturing at its plant within two weeks. After that it would take another six to eight weeks before new products hit store shelves. But even then, experts caution that many of the industrywide issues will continue to restrain supplies. 'This is going to be a problem and it's not going away for at least a period of several months,' Abrams said.", "e28a9bf91a1761c8e07a42911762d2c46e34c7d1aef48fbf3b3f481d": "On 25 April, the former Missouri governor Eric Greitens, now running for US Senate, posted a video on Twitter of him and Donald Trump Jr, firing semi-automatic rifles at a range. 'Striking fear in the hearts of liberals everywhere,' the former president's son said. In the accompanying post, Greitens wrote: 'Striking fear into the hearts of liberals, RINOs, and the fake media.' Greitens, a former Navy Seal, shared the video even though a woman whom he had an affair with accused him of tying her up and tearing her clothes off without her consent, and his ex-wife, Sheena, accused him of knocking her down and hitting one of their sons hard enough to knock one of his teeth loose, according to an affidavit filed as part of a child custody dispute. She also alleged that he purchased a gun, refused to tell her where it was and threatened to kill himself unless she expressed public support for him. Greitens' gun-focused messaging is concerning, according to researchers who study links between communication and political violence, not only because more than a third of the mass shooters in recent years also had a history of committing domestic violence, according to a Bloomberg report. But it's also part of a significant increase among politicians - largely Republicans - in recent years in references to guns and threatening language in campaign ads, according to researchers. That rhetoric contributes to polarization in our society and can translate to physical violence, they say. Given the tense political climate, researchers expect rhetoric from rightwing political figures to continue to coarsen and lead to more violence before the pendulum swings back to a less charged time. 'Violence is in politics as a violation of the idea that people have an equal say in the political process of choosing their governments and of being able to express themselves freely,' said Nathan Kalmoe, professor of political communication at Louisiana State University and author of Radical American Partisanship. 'Clearly this kind of messaging, where you're calling out political opponents while you're shooting at a gun range, is a kind of a violent threat.' Since Donald Trump became president in 2016, the number of threats against members of Congress has soared, according to data provided by the Capitol police to news organizations. That year, there were 902 threats against the lawmakers. In 2021, there were 9,600. Republicans are also more likely than Democrats to think civilians may need to engage in combat to save America. A majority of Republicans support the possible use of force to preserve the 'traditional American way of life', according to a 2021 George Washington University Politics Poll. Among Democrats the number was 15%. When asked if a time will come when 'patriotic Americans have to take the law into their own hands', 47% of Republicans agreed, as opposed to 9% of Democrats. About one-third of Republicans also agreed that 'because things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country', according to a 2021 survey from the Public Religion Research Institute. Among Democrats, the number was 18%. But the use of incendiary speech to rile up supporters in a democracy did not start with Trump. 'Certainly, we've experienced time periods in the US that were as divisive and as polarized as today,' James Piazza, professor of political science at Penn State University, said. 'It kind of goes in waves. And if you look at the type of speech and rhetoric that politicians used in those previous eras of polarization and division, they look a lot like what you see today; it's dehumanizing speech.' Trump and other Republicans are using threatening language to tap into anger about the shifting demographics of the United States and the sense that a Christian way of life is coming under threat, according to political scientists. 'Trump played into that anger and amplified it and went much further than most Republican leaders, especially the most prominent, had gone in very explicitly making these statements, not just the election rejection, but also the other kinds of anti-democratic statements, including hostility towards various racial, ethnic and religious minority groups,' said Kalmoe. One key difference between the Trump era and other highly polarized periods is the advent of social media, which amplifies speech by instantly sending it to millions of people and often strips nuance from a statement, according to Helio Fred Garcia, professor of professional development and leadership at Columbia University and the author of Words on Fire: The Power of Incendiary Language and How to Confront It. 'There's a giant megaphone that is out there,' said Piazza, who authored a study on the connection between political hate speech and domestic terrorism. 'There really is a whole new realm of the ability to mobilize people, to radicalize people, to have more fringe voices play an outsized role in national discussions.' Greitens is not alone among Republicans in using such incendiary language. For example, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, recently told Real America's Voice, a media group, 'The Democrats are the party of pedophiles. The Democrats are the party of princess predators from Disney ... Their identity is the most disgusting, evil, horrible thing happening in our country.' In interviews, political scientists said such language was occurring mostly but not exclusively on the right. But they struggled to provide examples of Democrats doing the same thing. In 2018, former attorney general Eric Holder, who served in Obama administration, said: 'When they go low, we kick 'em. That's what this new Democratic party is about.' 'Immediately the right jumped on him and said, 'He's provoking violence.'' Garcia said. 'Interestingly, the same people who said, 'No, Trump isn't promoting violence,'' criticized Holder. Given the charged political climate, the academics say more violence like - or worse than - the January 6 Capitol riot is inevitable. Piazza said this wave of divisiveness and polarization is reminiscent of the time before the civil war when 'you had similar politician rhetoric to mobilize voters and to demobilize and demonize the other side that resulted in political violence'. That said, Piazza does not expect something like the civil war to erupt. 'We do actually have pretty strong political institutions in the United States, and we have strong security institutions. The US military is extraordinarily professionalized, and the US military has done an extremely good job of being apolitical,' he said. Garcia also forecasts more violence. He thought the US could return to a more normal place after the end of Trump's presidency but because Trump still insists he won, Garcia thinks it will take more than eight years and further carnage for the pendulum to swing back to a more normal place. To avoid that, Piazza and others call for more regulation of social media. He is encouraged by bipartisan efforts to hold the companies accountable. He hopes the government introduces regulations so that a politician 'trying to rile people up for political gain or attention, or to raise money, wouldn't be able to get away with that on social media. They would have to really watch what they had to say in terms of demonizing others and engaging in hate speech,' he said. In the meantime, Greitens ranks third in the Republican Senate primary polling but still leads against Democratic candidates, according to FiveThirtyEight. Greitens and his primary opponents did not respond to requests for comment. In the campaign ad, Greitens and Trump switch from the semi-automatic rifles to handguns. It closes with them firing more shots and Greitens saying: 'Liberals beware.'", "9362248ba365faffe9469c056c899033e1a99016d1dc6247ed13f24e": "On an August morning in 1945, 600 metres over the Japanese city of Hiroshima, a small sun came briefly into existence. Few remember a sound, but the flash printed shadows on the pavements and sent buildings thrashing. The explosion - 2,000 times greater than that of any bomb yet used - announced not only a new weapon but a new era. It was a stunning military victory for the United States. Yet jubilation there was undercut by 'uncertainty and fear', the newsman Edward R Murrow observed. It took only a moment's reflection on the bomb's existence to see the harrowing implication: what had happened in Hiroshima, and three days later in Nagasaki, could happen anywhere. The thought proved impossible to shake, especially as, within the year, on-the-ground accounts emerged. Reports came of flesh bubbling, of melted eyes, of a terrifying sickness afflicting even those who'd avoided the blast. 'All the scientists are frightened - frightened for their lives,' a Nobel-winning chemist confessed in 1946. Despite scientists' hopes that the weapons would be retired, in the coming decades they proliferated, with nuclear states testing ever-more-powerful devices on Pacific atolls, the Algerian desert and the Kazakh steppe. The fear - the pervasive, enduring fear - that characterised the cold war is hard to appreciate today. It wasn't only powerless city-dwellers who were terrified ('select and fortify a room in which to shelter', the UK government grimly advised). Leaders themselves were shaken. It was 'insane', US president John F Kennedy felt, that 'two men, sitting on the opposite sides of the world, should be able to decide to bring an end to civilisation'. Yet everyone knowingly lived with that insanity for decades. It was as if, wrote the historian Paul Boyer, 'the Bomb' were 'one of those categories of Being, like Space and Time, that, according to Kant, are built into of the very structure of our minds, giving shape and meaning to all our perceptions'. Boyer remembered the unsettling news of the Hiroshima bombing, which occurred the week of his 10th birthday and shaped the rest of his childhood. Today, someone remembering the bomb that well would have to be 86 at least. The memory of nuclear war, once vivid, is quietly vanishing. The signs on the fallout shelters - those that remain - are rusted, and most of the world's population can't even recall an above-ground nuclear test (the last was in 1980). The bomb no longer gives 'shape and meaning to all our perceptions'; until recently, many thought of it only rarely. It has been tempting to see nuclear war as a bygone terror that no longer terrifies, like polio. Except that the threat of nuclear war, as Vladimir Putin is reminding the world, has not gone away. Russia has amassed the world's largest collection of nuclear weapons, and Putin has threatened to 'use them, if we have to'. The odds that he may are steadily increasing as Nato countries inch toward direct conflict with Russia. They are now sending Ukraine tanks and missiles, amassing troops in eastern Europe and providing intelligence that has allowed Ukrainians to target and kill Russian generals and sink a Russian warship. If this continues, the risk of nuclear war will be 'considerable', Russia's foreign minister has warned. 'The danger is serious, real, and we must not underestimate it.' Yet many of Putin's adversaries seem either unconvinced or, worse, unbothered by his threats. Boris Johnson has flatly dismissed the idea that Russia may use a nuclear weapon. Three former Nato supreme allied commanders have proposed a no-fly zone over Ukraine. This would almost certainly entail direct military conflict between Nato and Russia, and possibly trigger the world's first all-out war between nuclear states. Still, social media boils over with calls to action, and a poll found that more than a third of US respondents wanted their military to intervene 'even if it risks a nuclear conflict'. Nuclear norms are fraying elsewhere, too. Nine countries collectively hold some 10,000 warheads, and six of those countries are increasing their inventories. Current and recent leaders such as Kim Jong-un, Narendra Modi and Donald Trump have, like Putin, spoken brazenly of firing their weapons. After North Korea promised 'thousands-fold' revenge in 2017 for sanctions on its accelerating nuclear weapons programme, Trump threatened a pre-emptive strike, pledging to unleash 'fire and fury like the world has never seen'. 'This is analogous to the Cuban missile crisis,' one of Trump's former aides, Sebastian Gorka, insisted. Leaders have talked tough before. But now their talk seems less tethered to reality. This is the first decade when not a single head of a nuclear state can remember Hiroshima. Does that matter? We've seen in other contexts what happens when our experience of a risk attenuates. In rich countries, the waning memory of preventable diseases has fed the anti-vaccination movement. 'People have become complacent,' notes epidemiologist Peter Salk, whose father, Jonas Salk, invented the polio vaccine. Not having lived through a polio epidemic, parents are rejecting vaccines to the point where measles and whooping cough are coming back and many have needlessly died of Covid-19. That is the danger with nuclear war. Using declassified documents, historians now understand how close we came, multiple times, to seeing the missiles fired. In those heartstopping moments, a visceral understanding of what nuclear war entailed helped keep the launch keys from turning. It's precisely that visceral understanding that's missing today. We're entering an age with nuclear weapons but no nuclear memory. Without fanfare, without even noticing, we may have lost a guardrail keeping us from catastrophe. The nuclear age started at 8.15am, 6 August 1945, with the release of a 4,400kg bomb from a B-29 over Hiroshima. Forty-three seconds later, an enormous explosion shattered the city. That so much destruction could be wrought so quickly was shocking news, which until then only a small coterie of scientists and military officials had known. 'One senses the foundations of one's own universe trembling,' a New York paper wrote in reaction to the terrifying new weapon. What did the bomb mean? Atomic scientists, who'd had time to contemplate the question, rushed in to explain. The important thing wasn't that atomic bombs could incinerate cities - conventional weapons were already accomplishing that. What distinguished atomic weapons was how easy they made it, noted J Robert Oppenheimer, who had helped oversee the bomb's development. Atomic weapons 'profoundly upset the precarious balance' between offence and defence that had governed war hitherto, Oppenheimer explained. A single plane, a single payload - no city was safe. The implications were, the scientists admitted, horrifying. Albert Einstein had proposed in 1939 that the US government develop nuclear weapons, in order to ensure that Adolf Hitler wouldn't acquire them first. But immediately after the war, he worried about any country possessing such power. Along with many of his colleagues, he concluded that the only solution was a global government, sovereign above existing countries, that would hold the world's nuclear arsenal, enforce laws and prevent wars (other details were vague). One World Or None was the title of a bestselling book that Einstein, Oppenheimer and other scientists produced in March 1946. Even the head of the US air force contributed a chapter pleading for 'a world organisation that will eliminate conflict by air power'. Five months later, the world heard from another set of voices. The US occupation authorities in Japan had censored details of the bomb's aftermath. But, without consulting the censors, the American writer John Hersey published in the New Yorker one of the most important long-form works of journalism ever written, a graphic account of the bombing. Born to missionaries in China, Hersey was unusually sympathetic to Asian perspectives. His Hiroshima article rejected the bomber's-eye view and instead told the stories of six survivors. For many readers, this was the first time they registered that Hiroshima wasn't a 'Japanese army base', as US president Harry Truman had described it when announcing the bombing, but a city of civilians - doctors, seamstresses, factory workers - who had watched loved ones die. Nor did they die cleanly, vaporised in the puff of a mushroom cloud. Hersey profiled a Methodist pastor, Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who raced to the aid of his ailing but very much still-living neighbours. As Tanimoto grasped one woman, 'her skin slipped off in huge, glove-pieces'. Tanimoto 'was so sickened by this that he had to sit down for a minute', wrote Hersey. 'He had to keep consciously repeating to himself, 'These are human beings.'' Hersey's contemporaries understood the significance of these accounts. The New Yorker dedicated its full issue to Hersey's article, and within an hour sold out its entire newsstand print run of 300,000 (plus another 200,000 copies to subscribers). Knopf published it as a book, which eventually sold millions. The text was reprinted in newspapers from France to China, the Netherlands to Bolivia. The massive ABC radio network broadcast Hersey's text - with no commercials, music or sound effects - over four consecutive evenings. 'No other publication in the American 20th century,' the journalism historian Kathy Roberts Forde has written, 'was so widely circulated, republished, discussed, and venerated.' Tanimoto, boosted to celebrity by Hersey's reporting, made speaking tours of the US. By the end of 1949, he had visited 256 cities. Like Einstein, he pleaded for world government. World government: it seems now like a wild utopia. Yet an astonishing number of people - responsible, sober people - felt it to be the only way of preventing more Hiroshimas. Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee both supported the idea. In France, Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus championed it. France's postwar constitution provided for the 'limitations of sovereignty' a future world state might require. So did Italy's. Even in the US, which stood to lose its nuclear monopoly and global supremacy, support for a world state hovered between a third and a half in opinion polls. 'World Government shall come - this is practically the consensus in this generation,' wrote the University of Chicago's chancellor; he even convened a committee to draft its constitution. When candidates in the 1948 elections were asked if they favoured a global government with direct jurisdiction over individuals and peacekeeping powers, 57% said yes, including John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon. In 1946, the movie star Ronald Reagan donated $200 to the cause. Such enthusiasm, however, counted for little in the face of geopolitics. Rising tensions between Washington and Moscow erased the possibility of global government. Still, they didn't change the fact: across the west, leading thinkers felt nuclear weapons to be so dangerous that they required, in Churchill's words, remoulding 'the relationships of all men of all nations' so that 'international bodies by supreme authority may give peace on earth and justice among men'. For Albert Einstein, a world state was 'the only one way out': it was either that or annihilation. Yet the world state never came, and neither did another nuclear war. One of the most surprising and important facts of modern history is a quiet one: in the 76 years since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, not a single nuclear weapon has been detonated in anger. Most weapons don't work like that. Poison gas is one of the few other military technologies that, despite its effectiveness, has been shunned - the first world war was a gas war, but the second world war mostly wasn't. Yet even chemical weapons have seen intermittent use, as by Iraq in the 1980s or Syria in 2013. By contrast, the number of nuclear weapons used since 1945 is zero. Why? The conventional explanation is deterrence. The very thing that terrified Oppenheimer about nuclear weapons - that they made attacking easy and defending nearly impossible - meant that any country nuking a similarly armed foe would have to expect a counterstrike. 'Because catastrophic outcomes of nuclear exchanges are easy to imagine, leaders of states will shrink in horror from initiating them,' the political scientist Kenneth Waltz argued. This logic led Waltz to a counterintuitive position: nuclear proliferation might be good. It's not just that nuclear weapons deter nuclear weapons, it's that they deter major wars in general by making the risks too high. The greater the number of states with nuclear arms, the argument goes, the less likely we are to see violence on the scale of the two world wars. Conflicts have indeed become smaller since 1945. And although there have been border skirmishes between nuclear states - China and the USSR in 1969, India and Pakistan more recently - there haven't been full wars. The bomb 'gave peace to Europe', the nuclear physicist Abdul Qadeer Khan argued. Khan led Pakistan's nuclear programme starting in the 1970s and then transferred nuclear technologies to Iran, North Korea and Libya in the 1980s and 1990s. His active role in proliferation horrified many, but Khan felt that Pakistan's acquisition of nuclear weapons (it tested its first in 1998) had saved it 'from many wars'. By this grim reasoning, we might celebrate the fact that nearly half of humanity now lives in countries with nuclear weapons (and mourn Ukraine's decision in the 1990s to destroy its warheads). Yet central to Waltz's deterrence theory was that the 'catastrophic outcomes' of nuclear war were 'easy to imagine'. For Waltz, who served in Japan in the immediate aftermath of the second world war, no imagination was necessary. Others needed help. This is why John Hersey's Hiroshima article and Kiyoshi Tanimoto's speaking tours were so important: they turned nuclear war from an abstraction into a reality. It was a reality many lived with daily. Today, telling schoolchildren to hide under their desks if a hydrogen bomb strikes seems quaintly unhinged (though, actually, it's good advice). But besides whatever trauma they wrought, preparedness drills like that created a widely shared nuclear consciousness. People regularly envisioned themselves in the position of the Hiroshima survivors. And if they needed help, such films as On the Beach (1959, US), The Day the Earth Caught Fire (1961, UK), The Last War (1961, Japan) and The Day After (1983, US but broadcast globally) vividly dramatised what a nuclear war would be like. 'Is it possible never to think about nuclear weapons?' asked the novelist Martin Amis in the 1980s. 'The man with the cocked gun in his mouth may boast that he never thinks about the cocked gun. But he tastes it, all the time.' In the same decade, the psychiatrist Robert Lifton assessed the 'psychic toll' such nuclear dread had taken. Hiroshima and Nagasaki weren't just historical events, he argued, they were psychological ones, with rippling consequences. Living with the threat of annihilation threw 'all relationships' into question. How could children trust their parents to keep them safe or churches provide spiritual continuity in such a world? Lifton attributed the rise of divorce, fundamentalism and extremism to the 'radical futurelessness' the bomb had engendered. Maybe one could dismiss the fallout shelters as theatre and the films as fiction. But then there were the bomb tests - great belches of radioactivity that previewed the otherworldly dangers of nuclear weapons. By 1980, the nuclear powers had run 528 atmospheric tests, raising mushroom clouds everywhere from the Pacific atoll of Kiritimati to the Chinese desert. A widely publicised 1961 study of 61,000 baby teeth collected in St Louis showed that children born after the first hydrogen bombs were tested had markedly higher levels of the carcinogen strontium-90, a byproduct of the tests, despite being some 1,500km away from the closest test site. Unsurprisingly, nuclear tests stoked resistance. In 1954, a detonation by the US at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific got out of hand, irradiating the inhabited atoll of Rongelap and an unfortunate Japanese tuna fishing boat. When the boat's sickened crew returned to Japan, pandemonium erupted. Petitions describing Japan as 'thrice victimised by nuclear bombs' and calling for a ban collected tens of millions of signatures. Ishiro Honda, a film director who'd seen the Hiroshima damage firsthand, made a wildly popular film about a monster, Gojira, awakened by the nuclear testing. Emitting 'high levels of H-bomb radiation', Gojira attacks a fishing boat and then breathes fire on a Japanese city. Gojira - or Godzilla, as he's known in English - wasn't the only one awakened by the 1954 Bikini test. The test put Hiroshima back in the spotlight and raised the profile of its survivors. In 1955, Kiyoshi Tanimoto brought 25 women, the 'Hiroshima Maidens', to the US for reconstructive surgery. He appeared before 15 million viewers on the television show This Is Your Life and recounted his ordeal the day Hiroshima was attacked. (In an agonising moment, he was then made to shake hands with a surprise guest, a drunken Robert A Lewis, one of the two pilots who had bombed it.) As the anti-nuclear movement spread, 'Hiroshima' became less an unfortunate event in Japan's past than a semi-sacred one in world history, to be commemorated by morally serious people no matter their nationality. Tanimoto promoted 'Hiroshima Day' and by the early 1960s there were protests and memorials on that day throughout the world. Denmark alone held demonstrations in 45 towns in 1963. By then, Hiroshima occupied a similar place in public memory to Auschwitz, the other avatar of the unspeakable. The resemblance ran deep. Both terms identified specific events within the broader violence of the second world war - highlighting the Jews among Hitler's victims, and the atomic bomb victims among the many Japanese who were bombed - and marked them as morally distinct. Both Hiroshima and Auschwitz had been the site of 'holocausts' (indeed, early writers more often used that term to describe atomic war than European genocide). And both Hiroshima and Auschwitz sent forth a new type of personage: the 'survivor', a hallowed individual who had borne witness to a historically unique horror. What Elie Wiesel did to raise the stature of Europe's survivors, Tanimoto did for Japan's. In their hands, Hiroshima and Auschwitz shared a message: never forget, never again. Yet the analogy was imperfect. The European Holocaust was the work of many hands. Mass killing, ordered from on high, had to be carried out by countless willing executioners, who snatched the victims from their homes, stuffed them on to trains, kept them in camps, shot them, gassed them and disposed of their corpses. By contrast, the nuclear apparatus, once in place, could be set into motion by a handful of men in only a few minutes. This also meant, the world soon realised, that another Hiroshima could come by accident. The murder of Europe's Jews was many things, but it wasn't inadvertent. In nuclear standoffs, a plane crash, system malfunction or miscalibrated threat could all plausibly trigger annihilation. Nuclear standoffs are dangerous by design. As in the game of chicken, the point is to set off on a collision course and frighten your opponent into swerving first. 'Fill the nuclear glass to the brim,' Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev advised his colleagues, 'but don't pour the last drop.' Such brinksmanship requires leaders to quell their doubts, possibly even to convince themselves that they're willing to see the glass spill over. Perhaps some are. 'The whole idea is to kill the bastards,' said US general Thomas Power, when presented in 1960 with a nuclear plan designed to minimise casualties. 'Look. At the end of the war, if there are two Americans and one Russian, we win.' This is the man who led the US Strategic Air Command - responsible for its nuclear bombs and missiles - during the Cuban missile crisis. Generals like Power, tasked with winning wars, pressed often for pre-emptive strikes. Yet they were fortunately overruled. Deterrence is surely one reason why, but memory played an important part, too. At key moments, decision-makers vividly imagined what would happen if they fired their weapons. They knew what nuclear aftermath looked like. Even Truman, who had initially considered the bombing of Hiroshima 'the greatest thing in history', found cause for restraint. When the UN forces became stalemated in the Korean war, their commander Douglas MacArthur requested 'atomic capability', later explaining that he'd wanted to drop 'between 30 and 50 atomic bombs'. Although Truman readied nuclear weapons, he fired MacArthur and declined to use them. Why? Looking back, Truman complained of his 'locally minded' field generals who couldn't grasp what going nuclear would have meant. It would have meant an escalating war destroying cities containing millions of 'innocent women, children and noncombatants', Truman imagined. Truman 'just could not' drop the bombs, he wrote. And, he added, 'I know I was right.' Truman's successor, Dwight Eisenhower, felt the same. He built up his country's nuclear arsenal, but when his military advisers urged a preventative attack on the Soviet Union, he refused. He'd seen war, and he could easily envision a nuclear conflict. It would mean, he told them, a 'great area from the Elbe to Vladivostok and down through south-east Asia torn up and destroyed without government, without its communications, just an area of starvation and disaster'. He couldn't do it, either. Such familiarity with war's horrors proved essential in the Cuban missile crisis. The US placement of nuclear missiles in Turkey, followed by the Soviet placement of them in Cuba, brought the two powers terrifyingly close to war. But after a series of escalating threats, Kennedy's Soviet counterpart Khrushchev changed the tone with a frantic, personal appeal. 'I have participated in two wars and know that war ends when it has rolled through cities and villages, everywhere sowing death and destruction,' he wrote. Kennedy, as a fellow 'military man' who had also seen combat (Khrushchev mentioned this twice), would 'understand perfectly what terrible forces' could be unleashed. Kennedy did understand, and he veered away from what he called the 'final failure'. Yet even as Kennedy and Khrushchev were de-escalating their dangerous confrontation, a 'far more dangerous' one was developing at sea, the late historian Martin Sherwin has argued. Its resolution suggests just how important experiential knowledge has been in keeping disaster at bay. The situation involved a Cuba-bound Soviet submarine, carrying a nuclear warhead as powerful as the one that had decimated Hiroshima. The submarine, out of radio contact for days, had missed all the hasty diplomacy between Kennedy and Khrushchev. And so, when the sub's captain found himself beneath a US warship, he refused to surface when signalled. Instead, he stayed submerged while the US sailors grew more aggressive in their signalling. One skipper tried the unauthorised and reckless tactic of dropping grenades on the sub. The explosions were terrifying, and the Soviet captain understandably assumed the war was on. He ordered the torpedo readied. 'We're gonna blast them now! We will die, but we will sink them all - we will not become the shame of the fleet,' the ship's radio officer remembered him shouting. Firing the first nuclear weapon since Nagasaki at the US navy near Cuba at the height of the missile crisis would have almost certainly triggered nuclear retaliation. 'This was not only the most dangerous moment of the cold war,' believed Kennedy aide and historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr, 'It was the most dangerous moment in human history.' The disaster was prevented by a Soviet officer, Vasily Arkhipov, who by chance had been assigned to travel with the submarine. Fifteen months earlier, he'd served aboard a nuclear-powered submarine whose reactor coolant system had failed, exposing the crew to radiation and killing 22 of his 138 shipmates. 'He'd seen with his own eyes what radiation did to people,' his wife told a historian. 'This tragedy was the reason he would say no to nuclear war.' Now facing the likelihood of war in the Caribbean, Arkhipov talked the enraged captain down. It was astonishing luck: the submarine poised to start a nuclear war randomly had aboard one of the few individuals on the planet with recent experience of nuclear disaster. The ability to clearly remember and imagine nuclear war's consequences had been, once again, essential to averting them. In 1985, John Hersey returned to Hiroshima for the 40th anniversary of the bombing. He came to commemorate the past, but he found it fading. The survivors, on average, were now 62. Two of the six people he had profiled in his article were dead. Kiyoshi Tanimoto was still alive, but he was over 70 and retired. 'His memory, like the world's, was getting spotty,' Hersey wrote. By then, the above-ground nuclear tests had stopped (the achievement of decades of antinuclear activism and treaties). Apocalyptic movies continued, but more often featuring zombies, aliens, intelligent machines, diseases or climate change than nuclear catastrophe. Hiroshima's resonance, which once matched Auschwitz's, was growing muffled. Today, knowledge of the Holocaust is kept alive by more than 100 museums and memorials, including in such unexpected countries as Cuba, Indonesia and Taiwan. But there is no comparable memory industry outside of Japan to remind people of nuclear war. The result is a profound generational split, evident in nearly every family in a nuclear state. My father, born a month after Hiroshima was bombed, remembers going to a concert during the Cuban missile crisis 'wondering if I would survive to the end'. My mother had constant nightmares of nuclear war. By contrast, I was born the year the atmospheric testing stopped, and such thoughts never crossed my mind. The extent of my nuclear consciousness was the hours I spent playing a video game called Duke Nukem. That game debuted in 1991, the year the cold war ended and Mikhail Gorbachev declared that 'the risk of a global nuclear war has practically disappeared'. We should feel relief, but the dispelling of dread has made it hard for many to take nuclear war seriously. 'I hear people talk about nuclear weapons,' arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis told me recently, 'and it's just so divorced from reality.' They've become 'dead metaphors', Lewis feels, lacking the concreteness to disturb our thoughts or constrain our behaviours. With nuclear threats far from mind, voters seem more tolerant of reckless politicians. Donald Trump, a case in point, has made outrageous threats, praised his own 'unpredictability' in nuclear affairs and suggested using nuclear bombs against hurricanes ('you could hear a gnat fart in that meeting', a source told Axios). Yet in the energetic discussion about the risks of Trump's running for president in 2024 and winning, nuclear issues are far from central. Nor is it only Trump. The nine nuclear states have had an impressive string of norm-breakers among their recent leaders, including Trump, Vladimir Putin, Narendra Modi, Kim Jong-un and Benjamin Netanyahu. With such erratic men talking wildly and tearing up rulebooks, it's plausible that one of them might be provoked to break the ultimate norm: don't start a nuclear war. Caution does not seem in abundance nowadays. Invading Ukraine, Russia turned Chernobyl into a battlefield and recklessly shelled Europe's largest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia. The Zaporizhzhia attack unsurprisingly set part of the site aflame. It was 'the first time in history' that a nuclear plant had been attacked, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy pointed out. 'If there is an explosion, it is the end of everything.' But how guided are leaders by such fears? In the past 20 years, the US has pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and two of the three main treaties restraining its arms race with Russia (the third is in bad shape). Meanwhile, China has been developing aggressive new weapons. In 2019, India made an airstrike in Pakistan, the first time its planes crossed the military border in Kashmir - known as the Line of Control - since either state acquired nuclear weapons. India has 'stopped the policy of getting scared of Pakistan's threats', its prime minister, Modi, declared. India has the 'mother of nuclear bombs' and its arsenal is 'not being kept for Diwali'. The cost of the shredded norms and torn-up treaties may be paid in Ukraine. Russia invested heavily in its nuclear arsenal after the cold war; it now has the world's largest. The worse the war in Ukraine goes, the more Putin might be tempted to reach for a tactical nuclear weapon to signal his resolve. Already, Russia has threatened nuclear war multiple times, and yet Nato countries increase their aid to Ukraine. The 'current generation of Nato politicians', Russia's exasperated ambassador in Washington has complained, 'does not take the nuclear threat seriously'. Maybe they don't. Hiroshima lies just outside their collective memory. The oldest of the 30 Nato leaders, Joe Biden, was two years old in August 1945. The youngest, prime minister Dritan Abazovic of Montenegro, may not even remember the cold war, as he was five when the Soviet Union collapsed. That is what time does. Traumas fade, fortunately for us all. It is a profound achievement - though surely aided by luck - that no nuclear war has refreshed our memories since 1945. We should rejoice, too, that the looming dread engulfing past generations has largely dissipated. This is what we want nuclear war to be: an archaic practice, relegated safely to the past. But we can't drive nuclear war to extinction by ignoring it. Instead, we must dismantle arsenals, strengthen treaties and reinforce antinuclear norms. Right now, we're doing the opposite. And we're doing it just at the time when those who have most effectively testified to nuclear war's horrors - the survivors - are entering their 90s. Our nuclear consciousness is badly atrophied. We're left with a world full of nuclear weapons but emptying of people who understand their consequences. ", "ab2492f172a287482559fdba3c48e1d90ea17453a852ff7f6d03e7a0": "When Laurie Bertram Roberts was 17, she was sent home from hospital and almost bled to death. Pregnant and experiencing bleeding, she had gone to the emergency department of her nearest hospital in Indiana twice, and was told she was miscarrying, but, because a scan showed the foetus still had a heartbeat, she was also told there was nothing they could do. What she needed, in order to end a pregnancy that was ending anyway, was an abortion - but she says the Catholic hospital would not provide one. 'They had the power to end my pregnancy right there, when I was already bleeding fairly heavily, in a tremendous amount of pain. Instead, they sent my scared 17-year-old self, a mother of two already, home.' There Bertram Roberts collapsed. She closes her eyes, visualising the scene. 'I remember what it feels like to think you're dying. Laying on the floor, in my mom's kitchen, I passed out.' She was taken to hospital to have the emergency procedure that she could have had earlier. She had twins already, having got pregnant and married at 16 (though the marriage didn't last). By the time she was 25, Bertram Roberts, now 44, had seven children. She had wanted to terminate one of these pregnancies - her health was suffering so soon after her previous birth, and she was a single parent living in poverty. It seemed impossible to have another baby, but when she arrived at the clinic, she found she couldn't afford the abortion. 'I got turned away, and then I ended up being too far along. The trauma of that, even though I love my child ... I came to terms with having to stay pregnant, but not everybody does. I was fortunate - I had my mom and my grandmother to help me. That's the only reason I made it through. I can't imagine what it would have been like if I didn't have that.' Both these events - needing or wanting an abortion, but not being able to have one - crystallised Bertram Roberts's belief in reproductive rights, and set her on a course as an activist. Bertram Roberts, who identifies as a non-binary femme, is executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund, an organisation based in Alabama that provides abortion care and campaigns for reproductive justice. When we speak over Zoom, Bertram Roberts - warm, funny, just the person you'd want to get you out of a difficult situation - is at home in Tuscaloosa, with a Wonder Woman poster just behind her. The previous organisation she founded and is still involved with, the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund (MRFF), is now run by two of her daughters. Since the draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade, which had established a legal right to abortion, was leaked, Bertram Roberts says: 'I haven't been able to sleep, but before this, I was having trouble sleeping.' In the states she has lived and worked in, abortion access has always been fragile, and increasingly limited. Mississippi has a 'trigger law', which means that abortion will be banned if, as looks likely, Roe v Wade is overturned. It will almost certainly become illegal in Alabama, too, as well as neighbouring states, meaning options for women - even if they could afford to travel - will become extremely limited. It will disproportionately affect women of colour, who accounted for nearly 67% of abortions in Alabama in 2019, and those living below the poverty level, who will be more likely to self-manage abortion with pills at the risk of being caught, 'and criminalisation is going to disproportionately fall on black and brown bodies, because it always does.' Forced birth, says Bertram Roberts, 'is going to kill people. You can't force people to stay pregnant and then not expect that people are going to die, when it's more risky to give birth than to have an abortion. And that's just in general, that's not even specific to black women.' Yellowhammer and MRFF have provided women with money to pay for not only the abortion itself (since 2020, Yellowhammer has had its own clinic, but both funds enable women to access clinics across state lines), but transport, childcare costs, and food. Bertram Roberts sees reproductive justice as all-encompassing - not just providing access to abortion and contraception, but supporting families to look after the children they already have. 'We're also doing work around self-managed abortion, making sure people know how to safely use pills.' Bertram Roberts was raised a fundamentalist Christian and grew up believing abortion was evil. As a child, she would go on 'plenty of anti-choice events. I got told that I was a survivor of the 'post-Roe holocaust'.' A grim smile. 'And they would specifically say to me I should be very grateful that my white mother decided to have me because she was pregnant with a black man's baby.' Then, she says, 'life happened, and I became a teenage mom and wife. I got pregnant again and again and again, and you just learned that no issue is as black and white as anti-abortion activists try to make it seem.' She has always been an activist - when she was about 11, she started a petition at school to get a janitor, who had been bullying children, fired. In her 20s, she went to a community college, and excelled, despite having her last two children during her time there. At 27, she got a scholarship to Jackson State University in Mississippi, leaving her children with her mother while she studied for a political science degree. She would call them every evening, and spend every night marking their homework. In her third year, they were allowed to come and live with her on campus. University - where she embraced racial justice and feminist campaigning - politicised her. As an older student, and mother of seven, young students sought her out if they were pregnant and wanted an abortion. 'When folks needed to figure out how to get to a clinic or how to get the money, I was kind of that person.' She was also part of a group fighting to get the university to take the domestic violence she had witnessed on campus seriously (before university, she had survived domestic abuse). During this time, a fellow student, Latasha Norman, was killed by her boyfriend. 'We could have been doing actual preventative work,' says Bertram Roberts. 'One of the lessons that I learned from that is that we help us. It's good to work on policy and within the system, but at the same time, we got us. That really influenced the work I do now.' She became more involved in abortion rights around the time Mississippi was considering the 'personhood amendment', which, had it passed, would have defined life as the moment of conception, but was rejected by voters. Involved with the local branch of the National Organization for Women (NOW), she was the only person who would go on television to talk about the incendiary issue of abortion. 'A lot of people had jobs to lose,' she says. Bertram Roberts was unable to work because of chronic health problems. 'You can't fire me from being disabled,' she says with a laugh. 'What are you going to do? Fire me from being a caretaker to my kids?' Funny and forceful, she is a natural communicator, and didn't go in for euphemisms such as 'reproductive health'. 'Abortion! Say the word, otherwise a lot of times people don't even know what you're talking about. So that became my job. I became the abortion lady of Mississippi.' By 2013, she was escorting women to clinics. What was that like? She pauses. 'I won't say I wasn't ready, because I knew what they [the anti-abortion protesters outside clinics] were going to be like, but I don't think I expected them to be so personal. It was like they did research on me - they knew how many kids I had, they knew when I had them.' Her teenage daughters would go with her and Bertram Roberts remembers protesters calling them 'jezebels'. 'Like, who does that?' she says. 'They would come up to [my daughter] and be like, 'how many abortions have you had to be so eager to kill black children?'' Bertram Roberts wasn't, she says with a wry smile, 'ready for them to lecture me about black history. The audacity of these white people!' They would tell her that one day she would be on trial 'just like Nazis. 'OK, thank you, people who think The Handmaid's Tale is a fanfic. Please get the fuck out of my way.'' She gets abusive emails now, including one this week that ended by saying her mother should have aborted her. She laughs and says, 'there's nothing like being so anti-abortion that you think I should be aborted.' Bertram Roberts was meeting women who were sometimes a few dollars short, sometimes more, who couldn't pay for their abortion, and so she would scramble to raise money. At first funding came through NOW, then in 2015 she established MRFF as a separate organisation. 'It really came out of seeing people who didn't have a taxi fare, who came hungry. The need is so great.' Sometimes accessing abortion would mean travelling for hours, and women would tell Bertram Roberts they had food for the trip, 'but really, what they mean is they're going to buy a box of cereal on their food stamps'. The reputation of MRFF grew; at one point, she says, it was getting 100 calls a week. 'There's just no way to get back to that many people, and we were out of money.' It had to close down for a few months to cope with the backlog. Now the MRFF gets about 20 calls a week, 'and we're able to help about half of those'. (Yellowhammer receives 50 to 60 calls a week.) The majority of women who access the services, she says, 'are low-income or working class and already have kids. They understand the decision that they're making. And some folks just don't want to have kids.' They have included women whose sterilisation surgery has failed. 'People who were using contraception and it failed, people who had their contraception sabotaged, young people who are preyed upon or assaulted, grandmas who thought they were in menopause. People who get abortions are the people you know. That's what I've learned doing abortion care.' Abortion, she says, is simply part of wider reproductive healthcare. 'You never know when a pregnancy that is going as planned will turn into a pregnancy where you need abortion care. The bravado that some people have to think, 'It could never be me ...' I didn't choose to need an abortion at 17. I was a fully pro-life, never-have-an-abortion person and then almost died because no one would give me one.' Ultimately, she says, nobody should have to feel like a choice was made for them. 'You should have support whether you choose to parent, or have an abortion.' She smiles, clearly frustrated by the fight but ready for it. 'I don't see what the issue is. What is so hard about this?'", "1f767ff6d9728fdc75eecd135065e3ac9711d6f6121c25e385ded91f": "The UK government is threatening to write new laws to allow it to unilaterally override parts of the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol due to concerns over 'peace and stability'. But what options are open to the UK, given the protocol was part of a legally binding international treaty co-signed with the EU? Catherine Barnard, a professor of EU law at the University of Cambridge, thinks there are five options to consider. Article 16 of the protocol This is the most oft-cited set of clauses allowing for 'safeguard measures' which could include a pause of the checks and controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea in the event of 'serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist' or in the event that there is 'diversion of trade'. In a statement earlier this week, the government said 200 retailers had stopped delivering to customers in Northern Ireland. But while article 16 allows the UK to take 'safeguard measures', this has already effectively been put in place through earlier unilateral action to suspend the checks on many goods. The section of the protocol also requires the UK to give the EU a month's notice that it is invoking article 16 and the protective measures must be reviewed with the EU in the joint committee every three months. As a negotiating tool, this is not strong. But it could score points among unionists and Brexiter backbenchers. Section 7 (a) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 This gives direct effect to the supremacy of the withdrawal agreement over domestic law. It covers all three elements in the agreement - the Irish border, citizens' rights and the divorce bill. To invoke it fully would be tantamount to walking away from the Brexit deal entirely. Using Section 7 (a) would be very serious because it would mean removing the entire agreement which would remove citizens' rights too. What the government could be looking at doing is just turning the agreement off in respect to anything to do with the Northern Ireland protocol. Section 8 (c) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 This enables the UK to implement updates to any EU directives in relation to the Northern Ireland trading arrangements without having to go through an act of parliament. It results in what is known as 'dynamic alignment' of British and EU laws in this limited geographical area of the UK. This would delight the unionists who have complained that the UK's sovereign right to make its own laws for the entire country has been undermined by the protocol. Section 38 (b) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 This is known as the Bill Cash clause, which recognises that the parliament of the UK is sovereign. While the clause has been frequently referred to in EU scrutiny committee hearings chaired by Cash, a veteran Eurosceptic, it has never been challenged. It is also seen as stating the obvious, and is unlikely to be the core of legal manoeuvres made by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss. Article 62 of the Vienna Convention Barnard thinks this is where Truss and the attorney general for England and Wales, Suella Braverman, could be focusing their legal arguments. The 1969 pact allows for a country to withdraw from an international treaty when 'a fundamental change of circumstances which has occurred with regard to those existing at the time of the conclusion of a treaty, and which was not foreseen by the parties, may not be invoked as a ground for terminating or withdrawing from the treaty'. Barnard says this would be open to challenge, as all parties knew about the divisions in Northern Ireland and the Belfast Good Friday agreement includes mechanisms to respect all parts of the community. Article 62 also warns that this 'change of circumstances' could not be a reason for walking away from an international treaty if 'the existence of those circumstances [which allegedly changed]' were an 'essential basis' of the consent of the two sides. As the protocol was all about protecting peace on the island of Ireland and ensuring no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, this may not be a watertight ground for disapplying the treaty, she suggests.", "d75ab150358040bdb774c8b9935c88157b1c70bcc618c1540863c9bf": "It started in early May with a post on a Facebook page for second-hand goods in the Canadian town of Miramichi, New Brunswick. A hundred Canadian dollars had been hidden somewhere near the town's harbour, it said. The following days brought more clues for other locations. Some made sense. Most were maddeningly vague. A week later, the town of 17,000 has become gripped by a mysterious horror-themed treasure hunt, with thousands of local people grappling with a succession of clues - and the promise of a cash prize. 'I don't think anything of this magnitude has ever happened in Miramichi,' said Adams Robichaud, a high school student. 'And we just absolutely love it.' Robichaud has been unsuccessful in his attempts to find the money. But like others in the town - where many have felt stifled by Covid public health restrictions - he has been swept up in the excitement of the hunt. The game is run by a shadowy figure calling themselves Roman Dungarvan, and claiming to be a descendant of an Irish cook robbed and murdered at a nearby logging camp in the late 19th century. According to local lore, the cook's body was buried in a shallow grave in the nearby forest, but on the night of his death, the air was filled with the 'most dreadful whoops and screams anyone has ever heard'. The men fled the next morning - and the legend of the Dungarvan Whooper hasfascinated residents ever since. On the Facebook page Miramichi Mystery Machine, the younger Dungarvan posts messages with a distorted voice and the image of a hooded figure. Many of the competition's locations have a horror theme: one clue took the treasure hunters to French Cove, supposedly haunted by the headless nun. Another was the poster for the 1980 slasher film Prom Night. (The money that night was eventually located in an abandoned school building.) Tim Sutton, a local TikToker, found himself frustratingly close to one of the stashes of money. 'I was wearing my pizza costume - something I do for TikTok videos - and searched for nearly seven hours that night. I didn't find it,' he said. 'But it's not about the money. It's more about the hunt and getting out in the fresh air and kind of making new friends.' A few days later, Sutton successfully solved a different clue, and received the money via bitcoin transfer. Dungarvan has remained eerily close to the action, giving hints and directions to treasure hunters in real time.. 'One time he posted, 'Tim Sutton, you're going the wrong way.' ,' the TikToker said. 'Another night he said, 'Man in the orange shirt - you're close.' He's watching you.' Despite its forbidding persona, the Dungarvan character also has a softer side, reminding treasure hunters to socially distance when they met at a local Dairy Queen - and to tip cashiers. (Staff at a fast food restaurant told the Guardian that event brought in $50 in tips). On the Facebook group, residents have enthused about their new shared obsession. One woman described spending a rare day outside with her husband and children. 'They weren't glued to electronics - they were making memories,' she wrote. So far, six prizes of $100 have been discovered and Dungarvan says that this Friday - Friday 13th - at 7pm, the prize will be C$1,300. A posting for the event features an image from the Friday the 13th horror films, a warning that anyone with a heart condition should not participate - but also a plea for participants to respect the speed limit. Sutton admits the game could be a ruse put on by some local businesses or even the city. But he's already started trying to guess where the final payout could be hidden, drawing on his girlfriend's extensive knowledge of horror movies. 'There's so many different horror legends here in Miramichi that it's hard to know where to start,' said Sutton. 'But like everyone else, I know I'll be ready, sitting in my car on Friday the 13th at 7pm - and ready for anything.'", "4626d54f62d909faa41ef6ed018f5bda7f7a3acfa70ca7fcb05f890b": "", "ba8ca44bbce346be3b2a8a6b69726000592fbd23f34ffa12b6b1a56b": "", "0133f4227c7473cc3eaf9fef3cc4b41fb40cc31aebc91d59b7d9f9e2": "The departure of Sri Lanka's prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, follows weeks of protest and a deepening crisis. There is no bankruptcy system for states but if there was then the south Asian country - down to its last $50m (PS40m) of reserves - would be first in line to use it. A team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week started work with officials in Colombo over a bailout that will include a tough package of reforms as well as financial support. But as the IMF and its sister organisation, the World Bank, know full well, this is about more than the mismanagement of an individual country. They fear Sri Lanka is the canary in the coalmine. Across the world, low- and middle-income countries are struggling with a three-pronged crisis: the pandemic, the rising cost of their debt, and the increase in food and fuel prices caused by Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. David Malpass, the World Bank's president, explained his concerns at the organisation's spring meeting last month. 'I'm deeply concerned about developing countries,' Malpass said. 'They are facing sudden price increases for energy, fertiliser and food, and the likelihood of interest rate increases. Each one hits them hard.' The UN has sought to quantify the problem. Its trade and development arm, UNCTAD, said in a recent report that there were 107 countries facing at least one of three shocks: rising food prices, rising energy prices or tighter financial conditions. All three shocks were being faced by 69 countries - 25 in Africa, 25 in Asia and the Pacific, and 19 in Latin America and the Pacific. The list of countries that look vulnerable is long and varied. The IMF has opened rescue talks with Egypt and Tunisia - both big wheat importers from Russia and Ukraine - and with Pakistan, which has imposed power cuts because of the high cost of imported energy. Sub-Saharan African countries being carefully watched include Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Ethiopia. Argentina recently signed a $45bn debt deal with the IMF, but other Latin American countries at risk include El Salvador and Peru. For months there has been speculation that Turkey would be the first domino to fall, but despite an annual inflation rate of 70% and an unconventional approach to economic management, it is still standing. Unlike some other countries under threat, Turkey is able to feed its own people. Richard Kozul-Wright, director of the globalisation and development strategies division at UNCTAD, said: 'Countries have domestic problems but most of the shocks have nothing to do with those. The pandemic and the war had nothing to do with these countries, but have led to a huge increase in borrowing.' The World Bank said almost 60% of the lowest-income countries were in debt distress or at high risk of it before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while the cost of servicing borrowing is rising steeply, particularly for those countries that have amassed debts in foreign currencies. The war in Ukraine has led to investors seeking out the haven of the US dollar, pushing down the value of emerging market currencies. Higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve, America's central bank, have compounded the problem. Emerging market crises are nothing new, but Kozul-Wright said the international community was ill-prepared to deal with a looming debt problem. 'The system can only deal with these problems country by country,' he said. 'But these are systemic issues and currently there is no way of dealing with them systemically.' That may prove costly. Sri Lanka is the first country to buckle under the mounting economic pressures triggered by the war in Ukraine. It is unlikely to be the last.", "15a9016e3a74536db6f52abbb71752cc0bcb1b9391eda4c20ff71a99": "Two presidents and two speeches for Victory Day: from Vladimir Putin in Moscow and Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. Both presidents talked more about the present day than the past. Both insisted their enemies today were the heirs of the Nazis, and both promised their countries would succeed in what they both said was a defensive war they had been forced to fight. There, however, the similarities between the two addresses by Putin and Zelenskiy came to an end. The first difference was stylistic: Putin was surrounded by the pomp and militarism of the annual Red Square parade, riffing on a topic he has been angry about for years. Zelenskiy, strolling along Kyiv's main street and delivering a casual but impassioned speech straight into the camera, cut a very different figure, as he has since the start of the war. But the main difference was that for most people existing beyond the reach of Russian state television, Zelenskiy's arguments were likely to be a lot more convincing than Putin's. Putin has long used his 9 May speeches to draw parallels between the second world war and the present day, and this year's speech was nothing new, simply a compilation of previous grievances that were recycled and intensified for this year, when his army is fighting a new war. But the images from that war, seen across the world, have made Putin's politicisation of the Soviet wartime sacrifice even less convincing. Putin used the Victory Day podium to reel off a list of grievances against the west that seemed to describe his own regime more aptly. He made reference to 'cancel culture', complaining that so-called 'traditional values' had been cancelled, despite the fact his regime has arrested people for Facebook posts and shut down numerous newspapers for calling the war in Ukraine a war, and not a 'special military operation', the officially approved euphemism. The west was 'rewriting history', Putin complained, ignoring the fact that his regime has done more than any in Europe to quash free historical inquiry about the war years. In modern Russia, the Soviet war effort is seen as sacred, immaculate and not to be sullied by historical inquiry or archival research that might shed light on some of its darker moments. The Russian army was fighting in Ukraine 'so that there is no place in the world for butchers, murderers and Nazis', said Putin, a particularly grim claim given the well-documented evidence of executions, rape, looting and desecration carried out by his troops. For some years, Putin has hinted at comparisons between the modern-day US and the Nazis, bemoaning American hegemony and the 'unipolar world' that followed the Soviet collapse. Back in 2015, Putin used his Victory Day speech to say that 'in the 1930s, enlightened Europe failed immediately to see the deathly threat of Nazi ideology ... Seventy years later, history calls on us to be aware and alert once again. We have seen an effort to create a unipolar world, and we are seeing force-oriented thinking gain traction.' This year Putin made the comparison more explicitly. 'The United States, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, began to talk about its exclusivity, humiliating the whole world,' he said. Over the years, Putin's disquiet about American hegemony has resonated with many different political currents globally and is at the core of why some have admired the Russian president. This year, however, the invasion of Ukraine and occupation of parts of it has made Putin's message harder to stomach, even for many of his fans. One of the telegrams Putin sent on the occasion of Victory Day was a message to the people of Ukraine, wishing them 'good health, success and a long life'. Soon after the speech, air raid sirens sounded again in Kyiv.", "1ec255e7e5b4d62abb33fedb72dd1eadd4a9a86662cf36e208829fad": "The ancient Greek city of Paestum, on Italy's south-west coast, is hardly discreet - its temples are glaringly obvious for all to see. Yet it was only 'rediscovered' in the mid-18th century thanks to the grand tour, when the sons of aristocrats from across Europe, though mostly Britain, visited southern European cultural sites as part of their education. Now its majestic temples have a new guardian - a 38-year-old from Milan. Tiziana D'Angelo is one of the youngest people to direct a big Italian cultural site and is among the few female directors.  'You would expect a very serious and composed reaction but the first thing I did was scream,' she said on being told she had got the job. 'Then came tears of joy.' The first time she set eyes on Paestum, famous for its three Doric temples, dating from about 600 to 450BC, was as a child when visiting the site with her family. Her studies brought her back in 2012 to conduct research on the funerary paintings that adorned hundreds of tombs, dating from the Greek to the Lucanian and Roman eras. These were excavated in Paestum and necropolises in the surrounding area, and she studied them as part of her doctorate at Harvard University. 'I returned periodically and collaborated with Gabriel Zuchtriegel [the former director] on exhibitions, and so I maintained a relationship with the site,' said D'Angelo, who has also studied at Oxford and Cambridge, and until a few weeks ago was an assistant professor at Nottingham University. 'But never would I have imagined that one day I would come back here as director. It's a dream.' Paestum, located in the Cilento area of Italy's Campania region, is often overshadowed by the more popular Pompeii and Herculaneum. Even more low-profile is nearby Velia, where the Greek philosopher Parmenides was born, which along with Paestum formed part of Magna Graecia, the name of the southern Italian coastal areas colonised by the Greeks. The management of the two sites was merged in early 2020. Founded in about 600BC, Paestum was originally called Poseidonia, from Poseidon, or Neptune, the god of the sea, to whom the city was dedicated. It was later conquered by the Lucanians and then the Romans, although D'Angelo said the transitions were gradual. 'You have to think that these people coexisted. They negotiated space and power, and there is archaeological evidence of this: for example, the funerary paintings allow you to reconstruct this much more complex context,' she added. Paestum's walls and amphitheatre remain mostly intact, but it was only in the second half of the 20th century, when excavations began in earnest, that hundreds of painted graves were found in and around the area, including the Tomb of the Diver - the only one dating back to the Greek period. Discovered in a small cemetery in the late 1960s by the noted archaeologist Mario Napoli, its huge grave ledger depicts a naked man diving into the sea, said to be a metaphor of the transition from life to death. Other slabs from the tomb depict scenes of a banquet and homosexual love. The tomb is among those housed at Paestum's museum, and about 400 are currently held in a warehouse that D'Angelo plans to periodically open to the public. The majority date to the Lucanian period. 'You might think these paintings were just a commemoration of the dead, but they were part of the funerary process, as they were actually painted during the ceremony,' she said. Other treasures found at Paestum include various pottery, weapons and ancient Greek homes. Over in Velia, founded by Phocaean Greek colonists who made their way to southern Italy after their victory in a sixth-century naval battle over the Etruscans and their Carthaginian allies off the coast of Corsica, the most recent discovery was two warrior helmets believed to have originated from the battle, one taken from the enemy. Also found were vases and the remains of a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena. 'They built temples that contained Greek weapons but we also found evidence of Etruscan weapons, which tells us they also dedicated the weapons of their enemies to Athena,' said D'Angelo. She plans to consolidate the two parks, including establishing a bus link between them. In Velia, work is under way to make a former railway tunnel, currently serving as a warehouse for the site's treasures, accessible to the public. A museum is planned at Velia, while more space will open at Paestum's museum this year. The Easter weekend was D'Angelo's first as director, and there was a record number of visitors, a sign that she could be in for a busy time. 'I am grateful to all who made this opportunity possible, not only the director general who chose me, but my parents and the teachers at high school who made me passionate about the ancient world and art, and my supervisors and colleagues at the various museums I worked at,' she said.", "97a4cbca800d40961599aeb3245bbf09b1620034bdc420739f854ef6": "As a volunteer working alongside the Red army as they fought their bloody battles against Nazi Germany in Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, Livdmyla Lishtvanonva, 99, would pick up unexploded shells and ammunition with her bare hands to help clear the streets for the fighting men and women. 'Even off the roofs of buildings,' she recalls with a smile. 'We were fighting for our land.' Kharkiv, eight decades ago, as it is today, was the location for fierce battles in which many lives were lost and Lishtvanonva says that she and her mother, a nurse, had to leave their home city for a village on its outskirts after their apartment was destroyed in a bombing raid. Lishtvanonva laments that the last two months, particularly the sounds and sights of shelling, have brought such memories flooding back. This weekend, as Ukraine quietly marked a day of remembrance and reconciliation and Russia prepared for a more raucous Victory Day to commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany, those reflections are all the more poignant. But there are new memories now. From the window of her sparsely decorated room in the Kyiv nursing home in Chaiky village, on the western outskirts of Ukraine's capital, near the now infamous and devastated towns of Irpin and Bucha, Lishtvanonva watched just a few weeks ago as a neighbouring business centre went up in flames after being hit by a missile. Like the other 160 residents at the home, she spent days in its dusty and dark basement at the height of the battle and later had to be evacuated to the city centre when Russian soldiers on 8 March climbed over a perimeter fence to launch their drones from its leafy grounds. 'We had a problem with rubbish as it wasn't being collected so I was digging a big hole in the ground to put it all in when suddenly I saw Russians climbing over the fence', recalls Evhen Kryvtsov, 38, the director of the institution. 'I was in a big hole with a shovel. I thought my time might be up.' Thanks to the Ukrainian defence of Kyiv, the Russian stay at the home turned out to be brief, and Ukraine's victory in battle allowed everyone to return three weeks ago. Tetiana Rudyk, 42, the home's deputy director, laughs as she admits that the staff had checked behind every curtain and in every room for hiding Russian soldiers. But there is deep grief felt by the three women living here who are old enough to have memories of the war with Germany. Lishtvanonva, who lives in room 407, says she has always thought of herself as Russian and 'won't pick a side'. 'It is like any other war - it is two political parties fighting because someone wants to be noticed,' she says. But Lishtvanonva adds: 'We were fighting for peace [in the second world war]. I just want peace. Building is a lot more difficult than destroying.' Maria Lebid, 94, in room 406, who picked up a gun for the Red army is too ill to talk at any length, but cries when the war is raised, as does Valentyna Lits, 94, in room 444, who says she cannot understand how such brutal conflict has again come to the country - and via Russia of all places. Lits' father, Pavel, was in the artillery corps in the Red army during the fighting around Kyiv in the 1940s and she remembers a letter he wrote in which he spoke of being ordered to shell an area in which Russians soldiers were in close combat with the Germans. 'He said that he didn't know if his own people had survived,' Lits says. She has two grandsons in Russia in their 40s. They don't talk about the conflict with her when they call, she says, although one of them appears to believe in Putin's 'special military operation'. Yet, Lits' who has interrupted her reading of some old newspaper cuttings about healthy living in order to reminisce and share her thoughts, appears almost embarrassed to admit that what she reads and hears about in the news has filled her with an emotion that had been alien and unthinkable to her until now. 'Throughout my life, I was fine with Russians,' she says, pausing to control her emotions. 'I took some anxiety pills before you came but it isn't working,' she adds, before continuing: 'My husband was from the far east of Russia and his mother didn't want him to marry a Ukrainian but I was fine with Russians. Now, I see and hear what is happening, the murder and rape, the death of children, and I feel hate, I am filled with hate. And I never thought I would hate Russians, never.'", "a4f960495ec7f81a039e46a9949408e8e5d82a29afb31accb603f9ac": "Annette Arjoon is not anti-oil. The marine conservationist calls the vast new oilfields off Guyana's coast a 'blessing' that will earn billions of dollars for one of the poorest countries in the Caribbean, even as she recognises that pulling yet more fossil fuel from the ground will deepen the climate crisis. But Arjoon does have a problem with who is drilling the oil. She has seen firsthand what happens when the US's largest petroleum company descends on a small country bearing the promise of riches.  As ExxonMobil began drilling a vast oilfield offshore two years ago, the Guyanese government called in the Amerindian marine conservationist to help monitor the environmental impact of what is expected to become the company's biggest source of petroleum by 2025, outpacing even its wells sprawled across Texas. Arjoon, who leads the Guyana Marine Conservation Society, was not impressed. In time she grew to believe that Exxon was indifferent to the dangers of an oil spill to the coast and rivers of one of the best preserved parts of the Amazon biome, and of misleading her about its preparations to deal with such a disaster. She found the company's behaviour 'thuggish and disrespectful'.  'I can only judge Exxon by my direct and deeply personal relationship with them so far. They are not an honourable company,' Arjoon says. Suspicion about the oil firm does not stop with environmentalists. Guyanese politicians have accused Exxon of fleecing the country of billions of dollars by bouncing an ill-experienced government into a contract that pays far less than other countries earn from their oil. Then there is the pressing question of the future of the planet. With Guyana increasingly threatened by rising sea levels, Arjoon is conscious of the impact of Exxon opening a huge oilfield at a time when governments are being warned there can be no new oil or gas fields or coalmines if the world is to reach net zero by 2050. Liza-1 project, in the prolific Greater Liza area, was the first stage to begin production, with Liza-2 coming on line this year. The Greater Turbot discovery was announced in 2017, but is still not yet in production. Both areas are identified in research to be published this month into the world's biggest so-called carbon bombs - gigantic fossil fuel projects that would each result in at least 1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions over their lifetimes. Together they would contribute more than 2.1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions over the course of the project, according to the study, which identifies 195 similar oil and gas mega developments around the world. The Center for International Environmental Law has also warned Exxon's drilling and gas flaring 'may turn Guyana from carbon sink to carbon bomb'. Yet for all that, Arjoon is glad to see the oil flowing because right now, she says, Guyana does not have any other way forward. 'As an environmentalist with 35 years of experience in coastal communities through the length and breadth of Guyana, I see extreme poverty. Oil gives us a way out of that.' This drilling bonanza promises to earn Guyana roughly $150bn over the life of the oilfields, estimated at 30 years. For good or ill, that represents a huge change in fortune for a country of 800,000 people, where more than 40% live below the poverty line of $5.50 (PS4.20) a day. 'All of those that have exploited their oil resources to develop their countries should not be telling Guyana 'leave your oil in the ground',' Arjoon says. 'Norway is always used as the best example of a nation that utilises oil, and it is said that they have the best model for natural resources. So why should Guyana be any different? Who is to say that little Guyana, which has been blessed with so much abundant resources including oil, should not take advantage?' Others agree. There is a bittersweet sense that Guyana needs to hurry and get the oil out of the ground if it does not want to miss the fossil fuel party. After years of failed attempts, Exxon made one of the biggest offshore crude discoveries of recent times when it struck oil off Guyana's coast in 2015. Four years later, the then president, David Granger, proclaimed a public holiday, National Petroleum Day, to celebrate the first oil flowing from its wells. 'Guyana's future is brighter with the beginning of first oil,' he said in a speech to the nation. 'The good life for everyone beckons.' The government promised to set up a sovereign wealth fund, similar to Norway's, to transform the country with investments in roads, education and hospitals. Fossil fuel money is also being earmarked to develop renewable energy sources such as solar and hydroelectric for when the oil runs out, an irony not lost on Arjoon and others. There has even been talk of a $5,000 cash handout to every citizen, a small fortune for many Guyanese. Yet the hopes pinned on oil are tempered by Guyana's divisive politics, shaped by tensions between the descendants of enslaved Africans and Indian indentured labourers, and concerns about official corruption. For some Guyanese, their first encounters with Exxon have left them sceptical of the promises. A short drive east of the capital, Georgetown, George Jagmohan used to run seven fishing boats. He might be less angry about selling them off one by one since the oil drilling began if he believed in the declarations of a golden dawn for Guyana. 'Since the drilling started, the fish have gone. It's the blasting and vibrations,' says Jagmohan, sitting on a sea wall next to a clutch of idle boats. 'In another couple of years it will be finished. It never used to happen. People aren't stupid. I've been fishing for 40 years and it's not been like this before.' A few miles further up the coast, Steve Outar says his catches are down by about 80% but he has not laid up any of his four boats because he feels a responsibility to the crews. 'The fish production in neighbouring Suriname and Venezuela is still 100%, so why is it falling here? Because the vibrations are driving the fish and shrimp away. Some of my boats spend 18 days at sea but still don't catch enough fish,' he says as he cleans red snapper ready for processing as dried fish for shipment to China. 'Each boat has a captain and six men. That's 28 crew, and each of the crew has a family to support. If they don't catch, they get nothing. If we're out of business, they are out of bread.' Arjoon says overfishing and other factors have played a part in the decline, but she agrees that 'the massive seismics that were done in the early stages did have an impact on marine life, especially marine mammals. That was when you had an unprecedented amount of strandings of sperm whales.' But she says that when she tried to talk to Exxon about the timings of seismic explosions, to see if they coincided with the stranding of whales, she was fobbed off. And, like others, Arjoon fears not enough has been done in case of a spill that could devastate this coast. 'Exxon's modelling showed an unmitigated spill could impact the north-western part of the Shell beach protected area all the way to the Orinoco delta. What lies in between is a very special place, especially because that is where the largest national repository of blue carbon exists, at a time when our low-carbon development strategy has been expanded,' she says. The government says there is no evidence Exxon is responsible for reduced catches and notes that Guyana's overall fish production has increased by more than 10% from 2020, and exports for the fisheries sector have surpassed GUY$4bn. And Exxon said its 'first priority for every project is to put in place mitigations and processes that help to prevent adverse events by utilising the best technologies, equipment and people in our operations'. 'The Bank of Guyana summarises landing quantities in their annual reports on Guyana's sector economies; according to the data provided in those reports, fluctuations in the quantity of finfish and shrimp landings have been observed for many years. Oil and gas activities have not been included as potential factors.' 'We work diligently to avoid any spills. But should one occur, we are prepared to mitigate and resolve it as quickly and comprehensively as possible,' the company states. But Outar waves away officials' claims, saying that is not the experience of local fishers. And he does not have much faith that the promises made for oil will make up for the decline in fishing. 'Oil isn't going to help. It can make the country rich but the people won't be better off. We've still got to live day to day. We can't eat a new road,' he says. Jahmohan is blunter. 'Are you fucking crazy or what? It will all end up in the politicians' pockets. They'll be sitting there drinking champagne and whisky,' he says. 'They told us oil will make us rich. We've got gold, diamonds, sugar in this country. We should be rich from that but we're not. So why will oil be different?' Those concerns are more widely shared. Frederick Collins, the head of the anti-corruption organisation Transparency International Guyana, warned that oil 'can end up being more of curse than a blessing'. He points to the behaviour of big oil in the Niger delta, where millions of people live with flaring and spills but see few benefits.  Others look to the experience of Equatorial Guinea, which enjoyed an oil bonanza that in less than a decade transformed it from one of the world's poorest countries to the highest per capita income in Africa by 2008. But Human Rights Watch describes Equatorial Guinea's oil wealth as 'squandered and stolen' by the government, resulting in declines in healthcare and access to education. Vincent Adams, the former head of Guyana's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), says that should serve as a warning to Guyana as payments to its oil fund soar to nearly $1bn this year, permitting the government to increase its budget by 44%. 'It's not about the oil, it's about how you govern the country and how you govern the management of the oil industry. Oil is not going to be around for more than maybe 30 years. So the governance part of it is to make sure that we invest now so there will be a sustainable economy after oil is gone to attract foreign direct investment, to lay the groundwork in education, infrastructure, national security, health, agriculture,' he says. 'We are definitely not prepared for it. And the biggest frustration is that the government just does not understand what it takes to be prepared, and what it takes to govern under these circumstances to make the country a better country.' Confidence has also been undercut by the widely held belief that Exxon bounced a government lacking in expertise and desperate for money into a contract that serves the country badly, with the global human rights group Global Witness estimating that Guyana will earn about $50bn less than it would have done under a more common type of agreement. A Guardian/Floodlight investigation last year found grave concern among experts about the contract signed by the Guyanese government. Adams said he warned the government against the contract but it was afraid Exxon would walk away. The deal allows Exxon to deduct up to 75% of the earnings from its Guyanese wells as costs before the balance is split between the government and the company. It recently presented Guyana with a bill of more than $9bn for those costs, which the government admits it does not have the resources to audit. The offices of Guyana's president and natural resources minister did not respond to requests for an interview. According to Exxon, 'the terms of the contracts are competitive with other agreements signed in countries at a similar resource-development phase'. It added: 'Guyana's resources have been brought on line at a record pace for the industry, resulting in significant financial benefits for the government and its industry partners.' The project, after all, is steaming ahead. Guyana's vice-president, Bharrat Jagdeo, played a leading role in developing a low-carbon strategy and protecting the rainforest but is pushing for as much oil as fast as possible, telling a recent conference: 'Because there is this climate change imperative to decarbonise, our policy is to get as much oil out of the ground as quickly as possible. It sounds a bit harsh for those who think you should be environmentally sound, but that is the reality of it.' Arjoon will be watching closely. She calls the gap between Exxon's claims to prioritise environmental protection and the reality a 'disgraceful deficit', adding: 'I am not unaware that Exxon is here to ensure the best returns to their shareholders. 'Exxon is not here because they care about Guyana. But that does not mean they can treat us as an uneducated nation. We don't drink the Kool-Aid so easily.'

Francisca Sandoval, 29, was reporting in Barrio Meiggs, a ramshackle market district in the centre of the capital, Santiago, when a group of men opened fire after a standoff with the marchers. A bullet pierced Sandoval's visor, leaving her fighting for her life in hospital. Two other journalists were injured in the shooting. 'Francisca didn't leave us, they murdered her,' tweeted Senal 3 La Victoria, the independent media outlet Sandoval had been reporting for. 'With these words we confirm the death of our dear Fran. We will miss you and will do everything possible to find the truth.' Two days after the shooting, Marcelo Naranjo, 41, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, illegally carrying a firearm and unjustified discharge of a firearm in public. Following Sandoval's death, Chile's public prosecutor confirmed that the charges would be reviewed. A Colombian and a Venezuelan citizen were also held under house arrest in connection with the incident. Sandoval is the first journalist to be killed in the line of duty in Chile since the Pinochet dictatorship. The last, Jose Carrasco, was kidnapped from his home 36 years ago in 1986, days after a failed attempt on the dictator's life. His body was found three hours later riddled with bullets - and so disfigured that even his wife was unable to properly identify it. In 2022's World Press Freedom Index, published earlier this month by Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF), Chile plummeted to 82nd place - although still the fifth highest-ranked in South America. The report highlighted the overwhelming concentration of media ownership in Chile - a longstanding issue in the country, where two main groups dominate traditional media. 'Chile is living through a difficult period with regard to violence, and particularly violence towards media outlets,' said Carolina Munoz, director of the University of Chile's journalism faculty. 'This was evident during the protests in 2019, when we saw how journalists were hounded while carrying out their work, and we have also seen how groups formed to target journalists.' Chile's president, Gabriel Boric, 36, who had visited Sandoval's family at hospital earlier in the week, lamented her death and vowed that those responsible would be held accountable.", "076460a39ddf4db4a1dc9bc9647927fa00a01d8482ca31835d886f71": "A leading Turkish opposition figure has been banned from politics and sentenced to almost five years in prison, drawing widespread concern about a crackdown on leftwing organisers and politicians before elections expected within the year. An Istanbul appeals court on Thursday confirmed three charges against Canan Kaftancioglu, the head of the Istanbul branch of the main opposition Republican People's party (CHP), upholding her convictions for insulting a public official, publicly insulting the republic of Turkey, and insulting the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in tweets accusing him of theft. She faces a ban on political activity and a prison sentence of four years, 11 months and 20 days. While she could receive a suspended sentence, observers fear that banning the key opposition leader from politics is intended to sideline her before presidential and parliamentary elections. Polls indicate that Erdogan and his Justice and Development party (AKP) are likely to face stiff opposition after a year in which Turkey's currency has halved in value and inflation has reached close to 70%. In response, Kaftancioglu tweeted a video telling her supporters: 'Never stop, do not give up, do not get tired.' She added: 'We will breathe together when we establish the rule of law.' Speaking in Istanbul the same evening, the CHP leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, addressed Erdogan directly. 'All this cruelty stems from your weakness,' he said. Kaftancioglu, an outspoken, motorbike-riding leftist, is thought to have played a central role in helping the CHP win the Istanbul mayoral race in 2019, granting it control of Turkey's largest city. The CHP candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu, won the seat twice after the AKP demanded a re-run of the vote when its candidate first lost. 'For Erdogan this is about the risk of the opposition continuing to organise effectively with figures like Kaftancioglu, who put together a masterful campaign to protect the vote and denied the AKP a repeat victory in 2019,' said Soner Cagaptay, an analyst for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'It was the 100,000 volunteers assembled by Kaftancioglu who observed the tally, compiled documents, took pictures and slept on top of ballot boxes so nothing could be rigged and Imamoglu won. It shows pretty significant organisational skills on her part,' he said. Kaftancioglu had already begun a campaign to train observers before the general election. The CHP was defiant after the ruling. 'If Canan Kaftancioglu is banned, there are tens of thousands of Canans who will be on duty during the elections at the poll stations,' said Unal Cevikoz, a CHP member and retired diplomat. Kaftancioglu's conviction comes after a recent ruling sentencing the leftwing philanthropist Osman Kavala to life in prison over accusations he supported anti-government protests in 2013, as well a demand by prosecutors to silence a leading feminist group. 'I feel like Erdogan is tightening the noose on the opposition's neck,' said Cagaptay. 'It shows that for him, the risk of letting the opposition flourish and organise outweighs the benefits of the investments he might get as a result of his charm offensive towards the west.' A court in Istanbul is expected to rule on charges against Imamoglu in early June. He also faces a ban on political activity and could be jailed over claims he insulted the election officials who cancelled his initial win in 2019. If convicted, the ruling would sideline one of the CHP's potential presidential candidates.", "bd0183cc8f156e4133be2ed6a183c162edaebcd80c95e137fd118342": "For the first time, scientists have grown plants in soil from the moon collected by Nasa's Apollo astronauts. Researchers had no idea if anything would sprout in the harsh moon dirt and wanted to see if it could be used to grow food by a new generation of lunar explorers. The results stunned them. 'Holy cow. Plants actually grow in lunar stuff. Are you kidding me?' said Robert Ferl of the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Ferl and his colleagues planted thale cress in moon soil returned by Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, and other moonwalkers years ago and the seeds sprouted. The downside was that after the first week, the coarseness and other properties of the lunar soil stressed the small, flowering weeds so much that they grew more slowly than seedlings planted in fake moon dirt from Earth. Most of the moon plants ended up stunted. Results were published on Thursday in Communications Biology. The longer the soil was exposed to punishing cosmic radiation and solar wind on the moon, the worse the plants seemed to do. The Apollo 11 samples - exposed a couple of billion years longer to the elements because of the lunar Sea of Tranquility's older surface - were the least conducive for growth, according to scientists. 'This is a big step forward to know that you can grow plants,' said Simon Gilroy, a space plant biologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who had no role in the study. 'The real next step is to go and do it on the surface of the moon.' Moon dirt is full of tiny, glass fragments from micrometeorite impacts that got everywhere in the Apollo lunar landers and wore down the moonwalkers' spacesuits. One solution might be to use younger geologic spots on the moon, like lava flows, for digging up planting soil. The environment also could be tweaked, altering the nutrient mixture or adjusting the artificial lighting. Only 842 pounds of moon rocks and soil were brought back by six Apollo crews, and most was locked away. Nasa finally doled out 12 grams to the University of Florida researchers early last year, and the long-awaited planting took place last May in a lab.", "c338a41fc538cb7889a06289d4c644aeef1f8f2654cb7905a75cff2e": "A court in Kyiv will hear the first war crime trial since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, while the Kremlin bristled at Finland seeking to join Nato and Sweden moving to follow suit. In a watershed moment, a Russian soldier will be accused of murdering a 62-year-old civilian when he appears in the dock on Friday, with the case coming as the number of crimes registered by Ukraine's general prosecutor surpassed 11,000 and Unicef reported that at least 100 children had been killed in the war in April alone. The defendant who will appear at Kyiv's district court is Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, who is currently in Ukrainian custody. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles had come under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead the unarmed man, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered 'to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders', according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened 'dozens of metres' from the victim's house and was committed using an AK-74 rifle. The case was this week filed at a criminal court. 'He is here [in Ukraine], we have him,' said Ukraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, from her heavily fortified headquarters in Kyiv on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the prosecutor's office said: 'Prosecutors and investigators of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services] have collected enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder. For these actions, he faces 10 to 15 years in prison or life in prison.' Two other cases are likely to be heard in court within days including an in absentia trial of Mikhail Romanov, a Russian soldier accused of rape and murder. He is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region near Kyiv, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while 'threatening her and her underage child with violence and weapons'. The trial is another prpaganda triumph for Kyiv and another diplomatic move increasing pressure on Vladimir Putin with Finland's plan to apply for Nato membership, and the expectation that Sweden will follow. Moscow called Finland's announcement hostile and threatened retaliation, including unspecified 'military-technical' measures. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the Finns would be 'warmly welcomed' and promised a 'smooth and swift' accession process. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said: 'We would support a Nato application by Finland and-or Sweden should they apply.' Britain's foreign secretary, Liz Truss has urged a meeting of G7 foreign ministers to equip Ukraine to Nato standards and maintain sanctions against Russia until it has fully withdrawn. The BBC reported that Truss told the meeting in Germany: '[Vladimir] Putin is humiliating himself on the world stage. We must ensure he faces a defeat in Ukraine that denies him any benefit and ultimately constrains further aggression. 'The best long-term security for Ukraine will come from it being able to defend itself. That means providing Ukraine with a clear pathway to Nato-standard equipment.' Elsewhere, Ukraine has claimed that it has damaged a Russian navy logistics ship near Snake Island in the Black Sea, as the Kremlin bristled at Finland seeking to join Nato and Sweden moving to follow suit. 'Thanks to the actions of our naval seamen, the support vessel Vsevolod Bobrov caught fire - it is one of the newest in the Russian fleet,' said Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration. Satellite imagery provided by Maxar, a private US-based company, showed the aftermath of what it said were probable missile attacks on a Russian Serna-class landing craft near the island, close to Ukraine's sea border with Romania. Maxar images also showed recent damage to buildings on the island. Russia's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Renewed fighting around Snake Island in recent days may become a battle for control of the western Black Sea coast, according to some defence officials, as Russian forces struggle to make headway in Ukraine's north and east. Ukrainian forces are reported to have driven Russian troops out of the region around the second-largest city, Kharkiv. The Reuters news agency said its journalists had confirmed Ukraine was in control of territory stretching to the banks of the Siverskiy Donets river, around 40km (25 miles) east of Kharkiv. Regional authorities reported ongoing missile strikes around Poltava and shelling at Dergach, near Kharkiv, that killed two people. Russia's army said it struck Donetsk and Kharkiv on Thursday, killing more than 170 people and destroying Ukrainian drones and rockets. Fighting has continued in Ukraine's south and east. Ukraine's presidency said shelling continued throughout Lugansk - part of the Donbas region where Ukrainian forces are fighting Russian armour and Kremlin-backed separatists. Zelensky said in his Thursday address to the nation that Russian forces had destroyed 570 health care facilities in the country, including 101 hospitals. 'What for? It's nonsense. It's barbarity.' In the north-eastern region of Chernihiv, three people were killed and 12 others wounded on Thursday in a strike on a school in Novgorod-Siversky, the emergency services said. Iryna Vereshchuk, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, said 'difficult talks' were under way over the evacuation of 38 seriously wounded troops from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. 'We have started a new round of negotiations around a road map for an [evacuation] operation. And we will start with those who are badly wounded,' she told 1+1 television. Disputes have intensified over Russian supplies of energy to Europe - still Moscow's biggest source of funds and Europe's biggest source of heat and power. Moscow said it would halt gas flows to Germany through the main pipeline over Poland, while Kyiv said it would not reopen a pipeline route it shut this week unless it regains control of areas from pro-Russian fighters.

The threat to execute Ahmadreza Djalali, a scientist, is widely seen as a reprisal for Sweden starting the trial in Stockholm of Hamid Nouri, who is accused of war crimes and murder committed during and after the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.  The trial of Nouri, arrested in 2019 on a trip to Sweden, is seen as unprecedented. Iran claims the two cases are not related and says Djalali's death sentence will not be rescinded. The French foreign ministry has demanded the immediate release of Cecile Kohler and her husband, who were arrested as they prepared to leave Tehran for Paris on 7 May after a holiday in Iran. Iranian authorities have accused her of 'attempting to create political chaos' by allegedly associating with representatives of the Iranian Teachers Trade Association during her visit. The ministry has summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires in Paris to demand consular access to the couple. There are now four French nationals in Iranian jails. Days after Kohler and her husband were arrested the EU's chief negotiator, Enrique Mora, landed in Tehran to try to revive the Vienna-based talks on the Iran nuclear deal. Those talks have ground to an effective standstill over whether the US is willing to lift sanctions against the Revolutionary Guards. Activists say Iran is engaged in a brazen policy of taking foreigners hostage to extract concessions from the west. Iran denies any such policy and insists all foreigners are tried according to due legal process. However it has repeatedly shown a willingness to exchange prisoners and taken part in swaps in the past. Djalali was arrested in Tehran and charged with spying after a university invited him to attend a workshop. He has been threatened with execution before, but his wife, Vida Mehrannia, has lobbied hard to keep him alive. She says she might be prepared to see her husband swapped for someone the Iranians want released, but not for Nouri - the only swap the Iranians are likely to accept.  Djalali says he was forced to give a false confession under torture and threats, and his family vehemently deny the spying charge against him. Nouri has been charged with international war crimes and human rights abuses in connection with the murders of more than 100 people at the Gohardasht prison in Karaj. His trial is taking place under the principle of universal jurisdiction. The latest repression shows the continuing power of Hossein Taeb, the head of the Revolutionary Guards' intelligence, and the seeming lack of influence of Iran's foreign ministry.", "88e18aa56a74987c43c475e635b0b740d24103aeff1489173d0daced": "More than 90,000 civil servants are likely to lose their jobs in an attempt by Boris Johnson to find money to ease the cost of living crisis. The prime minister is understood to have tasked the cabinet with cutting staff by a fifth, telling them every bit of cash saved on government spending could be better used elsewhere. He is thought to have made the demand to ministers during an away day in Stoke-on-Trent on Thursday. 'We have got to cut the cost of government to reduce the cost of living,' he told the Daily Mail. He hinted at future tax cuts, suggesting the billions saved from reducing civil servant numbers could help fund such measures. 'Every pound the government pre-empts from the taxpayer is money they can spend on their own priorities, on their own lives,' he said. Johnson ordered ministers to return civil servant numbers to those of 2016 in the coming years, with staffing having increased by almost 25% to 475,000 full-time equivalent jobs. Ministers will have a month to put together proposals for how they will achieve this within their departments. A government spokesperson said: 'The PM and ministers are clear that the civil service does an outstanding job delivering for the public and driving progress on the government's priorities. 'But when people and businesses across the country are facing rising costs, the public rightly expect their government to lead by example and run as efficiently as possible.' Johnson has reportedly indicated the government was poised to cut taxes amid the cost of living crisis - but the idea was quickly shut down by the Treasury.

The flood warning siren sounded in Grantham on Friday morning, as residents in low-lying areas were urged to move to higher ground. Meteorologists have predicted severe weather and heavy rainfall to drench south-east Queensland on Friday, including in Brisbane, Toowoomba, Gympie, Bundaberg, Gladstone, Caboolture and Gatton. Totals of 160mm could bring life-threatening flash flooding, with major flooding forecast for Cape River, Laidley Creek, Cooper Creek, Warrill Creek, Bremer River and the Logan and Condamine rivers. Moderate flood warnings have been issued for upper Brisbane River, Eyre Creek, Baffle Creek and Kolan River, as well as Mary River at Gympie. Initial flood watch notices have been issued for the Wide Bay and Burnett, Darling Downs and Granite Belt areas in south-east Queensland. Lockyer Creek residents in low-lying areas were urged to self-evacuate, and those whose homes were flooded in February were told to activate their emergency plan. A public shelter was opened at Lowood state high school. The area was among those devastated in the historic 2011 floods. An alert was also issued for Stanthorpe, on the southern downs, but there was no immediate evacuation order. QFES assistant commissioner Andrew Short said residents should reconsider their need to travel, with hundreds of roads already cut by flood waters. Almost 70 schools have been closed. 'Currently, we've got 18 emergency alerts out in a number of councils,' he told ABC radio on Friday. 'So we're looking for people just to listen and respond and act accordingly.' Queensland Fire and Emergency Services swiftwater teams conducted seven rescues overnight and responded to more than 900 calls for help. The Bureau of Meteorology said the highest rainfall over the past 24 hours was near Wilsons Peak, on the border of NSW and Queensland, which reached totals of 290mm. Lockyer Valley council is advising the community to stay in a safe location until threats subside and to not attempt to walk or drive through any flood waters. 'The unfolding rain event is an extremely dangerous situation, and preservation of life remains our key priority,' the council tweeted on Friday morning. The Warrego Highway has also been cut by flood water at Glenore Grove, with flash flooding occurring in many locations across the state. Gympie, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Cooroy, Nambour and Rainbow Beach were all on flood watch on Friday morning as a surface trough moved across the coast. 'Locally intense rainfall which may lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is possible with thunderstorms during Friday afternoon,' the bureau said in an alert on Thursday. The BOM warned of further heavy rainfall over the next 24 hours before lowering in intensity and easing after the weekend. Heavy rainfall across Queensland is the state's sixth major flood event since December with a combined death toll of 28. A man was found safe and well after disappearing near a campsite south of Gympie. Police and swift water rescue crews had been searching for the 36-year-old after he was reported missing at 10am on Thursday. He was last seen chasing his dog away from the Yabba Creek Road campground near Imbil about 11.30pm on Wednesday.
