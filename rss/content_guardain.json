Speaking on Telegram, Capt Sviatoslav Palamar of the Azov regiment said the steelworks where 200 civilians remain trapped underground was being targeted by artillery and planes, according to Reuters.  Palamar said two civilians were killed and 10 injured. He said: The reports could not be independently verified.  According to Mariupol's mayor, Vadym Boichenko, more than 200 civilians remain in the Azovstal steel plant, Reuters reports. The five-day operation to evacuate women, children and the elderly from the steelworks was coordinated by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. One of the evacuees, Alina Kozitskaya, who spent weeks sheltering in a basement, told Reuters: Echoing the words of Winston Churchill virtually at the Verkhovna Rada, Johnson described Ukraine's resistance as: 'finest hour, that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come'. While his remarks were met with a standing ovation, Inna Sovsun, the deputy leader of the Holos Party told the PA news agency that while the speech gave them 'hope' she contested Johnson's description:  Sovsun added, that while Johnson was speaking, Russian forces had stormed a steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol.  The EU sanctions intent on breaking 'the Russian war machine' are now imminent, the president of the European Council has said, as Germany pivoted to back the move. A proposal to phase in a prohibition on Russian oil imports will be discussed by member state ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday, with the most dependent, such as Slovakia and Hungary, seeking exemptions. Russia accounts for about 25% of oil imports to the EU, although the level of dependency varies between member states. The German government signalled this weekend that it believes it can completely phase out its use 'by the late summer'. Hungary's foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, said Budapest could not support sanctions: Read more from my colleagues Daniel Boffey, Jennifer Rankin and Philip Oltermann here: It is 7.30pm on Tuesday in Kyiv, and here is a quick catchup of where things stand: As people filtered back to Kyiv after Russian troops abandoned their attempts to seize it, tattoo artists noticed an increasing demand for art that paid tribute to the tragedy and violence of the spring, and to Ukraine's spirit of resistance. Mariika, a tattoo artist who now has an anti-tank hedgehog on her leg and a molotov cocktail on her arm, said: For several Saturdays she has joined a group of tattoo artists in a Kyiv party district for a fundraising day at a nightclub, currently out of action because of the war and curfew. Already, they have raised more than 100,000 hryvnia (PS2,700) for the army.

On Twitter, the governor of Donetsk, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said: Russia has previously denied targeting civilians.  Ukraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has accused Russia of using rape as a war tactic, and described president Vladimir Putin as 'the main war criminal of the 21st century'. While visiting the city of Irpin, Venediktova said Ukraine was collecting information on allegations of rape, torture and other suspected war crimes from women, men and children by Russian forces, Reuters reports. She said: She added that some of the victims remaining in Ukraine fear speaking out, afraid of the return of Russian forces.  The Kremlin has previously denied war crime allegations against its forces, as well as suggestions that Putin is a war criminal.  Earlier today, Boris Johnson said 'Ukraine will win' against Russia and 'will be free', during a virtual address to a packed Ukrainian parliament to standing ovations. Watch the address here: Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, has passed a law that bans political parties who justify, recognise or deny Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine, according to the Interfax news agency. The law will also ban parties who glorify or justify the actions of those carrying out armed aggression against Ukraine. Taking to Telegram, the head of the Servant of the People political party Olena Shuliak, said: She said the decision was supported by 330 votes. A 12-year-old orphan from Mariupol, who ended up in Russian-controlled Donetsk after being injured in a blast that killed her father, has been reunited with her grandfather. Before leaving hospital on Tuesday, Kira Obedinsky was visited by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who gave her an iPad. Alexsandr Obedinsky, 67, said that it's a moment his young granddaughter will treasure forever: The Guardian highlighted Kira's plight in early April and a week later Ukraine's deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk called Alexsandr on his mobile phone.

Video footage showed thick smoke in the sky above the Soviet-era site, where officials said up to 200 civilians, including children, remained trapped in a network of underground bunkers and tunnels with up to 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers. The International Committee of the Red Cross said more than 100 civilians had managed to escape in a convoy of buses and ambulances accompanied by ICRC and UN teams, joined by families and individuals in private vehicles. The convoy, including some injured, reached Ukrainian-held Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles (230km) to the west, safely on Tuesday, the ICRC said. Others from the plant 'went elsewhere' under their own steam and unaccompanied, it said. Exhausted-looking people, including young children and pensioners laden with bags, clambered off buses in the car park of a shopping centre in the city. 'I can't believe I made it, we just want rest,' Alina Kozitskaya told a Reuters reporter. One middle-aged woman walked away from the evacuation bus sobbing and comforted by an aid worker. A few women greeting the convoy held up handmade signs, calling on Ukrainian authorities to evacuate the soldiers - their relatives and loved ones - who are trapped in Azovstal and encircled by Russian forces. 'We're scared ... the guys will be left there. We don't see any sign of help,' said Ksenia Chebysheva, 29, whose husband is among Azov battalion troops there. She had heard that her husband was still alive on 26 April, but had had no news since. The UN confirmed the 'successful evacuation' of 101 civilians in the five-day operation. 'Women, men, children and older persons could finally leave the bunkers below the steelworks and see the daylight after two months,' said Osnat Lubrani, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine. 'Over the past days, travelling with the evacuees, I have heard mothers, children and frail grandparents speak about the trauma of living day after day under unrelenting heavy shelling and the fear of death, and with extreme lack of water, food, and sanitation,' Lubrani said. 'They spoke of the hell they have experienced since this war started, seeking refuge in the Azovstal plant, many being separated from family members whose fate they still don't know.' She said another 58 people had joined the convoy from the city of Mangush, outside Mariupol. Pascal Hundt of the ICRC said the organisations 'had hoped more people would have been able to join' and that 'similar agreements are urgently required to alleviate the immense suffering of civilians trapped in hostilities'. Mariupol's mayor, Vadym Boichenko, had earlier said the column of evacuees should reach Zaporizhzhia on Tuesday, adding that 200 more civilians were still trapped under the complex and approximately 100,000 remained in the rest of the city. Hospitals had been stocked up and medical staff reinforced by volunteers in preparation for the arrival of the convoy, Dorit Nitzan, the World Health Organization (WHO) incident manager for Ukraine, told Reuters. 'We are ready for burns, fractures and wounds, as well as diarrhoea, respiratory infections. We are also ready to see if there are pregnant women, children with malnutrition. We are all here and the health system is well prepared,' she said, adding that mental health was the 'big issue'. Russia's defence ministry said its forces and pro-Moscow separatists were targeting the Azovstal plant with heavy artillery and aircraft fire, accusing its defenders of taking up new fighting positions during the weekend ceasefire that allowed the partial civilian evacuation. The deputy commander of the Azov regiment, which is holed up in the plant, told the Associated Press that Russian forces were storming the site, while another Ukrainian officer confirmed the assault on public television. 'The enemy is trying to storm the Azovstal plant with significant forces, using armored vehicles. Our fighters are repelling all attacks,' Denys Shlega, commander of the 12th operational brigade of Ukraine's national guard, said. Having failed to capture the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, has switched the invasion's focus to the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, collectively known as Donbas, parts of which have been held by Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Russian troops are trying to encircle a large Ukrainian force there, with massive bombardment along the front. Ukraine's second biggest city, Kharkiv, again came under heavy bombardment on Tuesday, the country's military command said. It said its forces were defending the approach to Kharkiv from Izium, a town on the Donets river, about 75 miles to the south-east, adding that Russian forces were also trying to take the frontline town of Rubizhne and heavy clashes were also taking place around Popasna, in Luhansk. At least nine civilians were killed by Russian fire in Donetsk. In a post on Telegram, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the province's governor, said: 'The consequences of the shelling and bombing have yet to be established, but at least three people have been killed and two wounded and eight houses damaged.' Three more civilians were killed while drinking water in the town of Vuhledar, and another three in Lyman, Kyrylenko said. Some other areas of Donetsk were under constant fire and regional authorities were trying to evacuate civilians from frontline areas, the Ukrainian president's office said.", "52e6f58c7f5ab6fa144004f08f52d5cf1a99fba05555c00b2aa11ed8": "Russia has accused Israel of supporting the 'neo-Nazi regime' in Kyiv as it escalates a diplomatic row with one of the few close US allies that decided not to join in sanctions against the Kremlin or send lethal military aid to Ukraine. The dispute over remarks by Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who said in an interview that Adolf Hitler 'had Jewish blood' and that the 'most rabid antisemites tend to be Jews', has threatened to unsettle Israel's careful position over Russia's war in Ukraine. On Monday, Israel summoned Russia's ambassador to the foreign ministry and its foreign minister, Yair Lapid, called Lavrov's remarks 'unforgivable and outrageous ... as well as a terrible historical error.' Lapid wrote: 'Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust. The lowest level of racism against Jews is to accuse Jews themselves of antisemitism.' On Tuesday, Russia's foreign ministry doubled down on Lavrov's words, accusing Lapid of making 'antihistorical' remarks about the Holocaust that 'largely explain the course of the current Israeli government in supporting the neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv. 'Unfortunately, history knows tragic examples of Jewish cooperation with the Nazis,' the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. The Hitler comments appear to have added to the pressure for Israel to abandon its attempts to maintain a neutral stance on the Russian war in Ukraine, a position that has angered its US allies. Since the war broke out, Israel has set up a field hospital in western Ukraine, provided humanitarian supplies, and protective vests and helmets for the Ukrainian army. It has so far refrained from sending more substantial military aid or imposing sanctions on Russia. Israel has a delicate relationship with Russia, as both have military interests in Syria. As the conflict drags on and more evidence of atrocities committed by Russian forces against civilians has come to light, Israeli criticism has become more vocal, with Lapid last month accusing Russia of war crimes. In an interview with Ynet published on Monday evening, he said of his counterpart's allegations: 'That angers me not only as foreign minister but also as the son of my father, who was in the ghetto in Budapest. It wasn't Jews who put him in the ghetto. The Nazis put him there. The Nazis persecuted the Jews and killed 6 million Jews. The Ukrainians aren't Nazis, only the Nazis were Nazis.' The Israeli daily Haaretz reported on Tuesday that military and political establishments were considering bolstering assistance to Ukraine in the wake of the diplomatic row. The list of items that can be sent to Ukraine will be reviewed in the next few days, the newspaper said. But according to a quoted source in the Haaretz report, Israel will shy away from sending advanced weaponry or defensive technology, such as the missile defence systems President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has asked the Knesset to supply. New shipments of military equipment are likely to be 'symbolic', the source said, in keeping with Israel's existing policy of avoiding antagonising Moscow. Little has surfaced of what was discussed during Monday's almost unprecedented summoning of the Russian ambassador, Anatoly Viktorov, for a clarification meeting on Lavrov's incendiary comments. 'The Israeli position was made clear in the meeting and the parties agreed that no further details would be published,' an unnamed official told local media on Tuesday, in what appeared to be an attempt to let the matter lie. Israel's western allies have been pressuring the country to increase its support for Ukraine since the war broke out in February. Officials are also reportedly worried that Israel's continued balancing act between Russia and the west could hurt the arms industry by sending the signal that Israel could also sit out future conflicts. Analysts said Lavrov's inflammatory remarks, which threatened to antagonise one of the few western countries still willing to engage with Russia, were indicative of the 'radicalisation' of much of the Russian government and the lack of coherency to its goals in Ukraine. 'Diplomacy as a skill, as an art collapsed with everything else on February 24th,' said Alexander Baunov, a Russian political analyst who previously served as a diplomat. There are 'no rules, no skills, no rationality ... nothing is as usual. They are all disoriented in this new world, including people like Lavrov, Putin himself, they don't know how to speak, what is allowed and what is not. 'They are concentrated on one task which is to justify the thing they have done which is not going as is expected,' he said, referring to the invasion of Ukraine. 'And they still have to justify it.'", "33b7e1c4bb5674addedce975802cf131959dc2d3a4e4acd6f83e3d02": "A 12-year-old orphan from Mariupol, who ended up in Russian-controlled Donetsk after being injured in a blast that killed her father, has been discharged from a children's hospital in Kyiv to start a new life after being reunited with her grandfather. It is, perhaps, the end of the beginning of the suffering Kira Obedinsky has endured over the last two months. Before leaving the hospital on Tuesday, she was visited by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who gave her an iPad. It was a moment, said Alexsandr Obedinsky, 67, that his young granddaughter will treasure for ever. 'She couldn't believe it was happening to her. All of us need positive emotions now, and so does Kira.' Much of Kira's life in the last two months has been barely believable. In the early weeks of Vladimir Putin's 'special military operation', Kira had been sheltering with her father, Evgeny, and his partner, Anya, and her children, in the basement of a neighbour's house in Mariupol. The building was hit directly, and while Kira and the others were dragged from the rubble by rescuers, Evgeny did not survive, leaving the young girl, whose mother died two weeks after her birth, an orphan. In the days after, Anya decided she had to try to get Kira and the other children out of Mariupol, but as the group walked through the debris of the shattered city, one of them stood on a mine. In the subsequent chaos, Kira ended up in the hands of Russian soldiers who took her, bleeding from shrapnel wounds to the face and body, to Donetsk's regional hospital in a separatist-controlled part of the Donbas region. In the coming weeks, Kira even featured on Russian state television as an example of a Ukrainian civilian who was being well treated. Alexsandr received a video call from her that provided relief, but also anxiety, as reports were emerging of Ukrainian civilians being forcibly taken to Russia. The Guardian highlighted Kira's plight in early April and a week later Ukraine's deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk called Alexsandr on his mobile phone. 'I mean, I was trying hard, searching for someone who could help me, Ukrainian authorities and everyone I could reach,' Alexsandr said. 'I knocked on all doors, the Red Cross, our government, anyone.' He went on: 'Iryna Vereshchuk called me on 15 April and told me it was possible to get Kira back, but to do so I had to go to Donetsk. She asked if I was ready to do it, with safety guarantees from President Zelenskiy. I said I was ready and they took me.' Alexsandr arrived in Kyiv on 17 April to discuss logistics. 'Then we went to Poland, from Poland to Turkey, from Turkey to Rostov in Russia and then from Rostov to Donetsk People's Republic, I mean, to Donetsk,' he said. 'We spent the night there and in the morning they took me to meet Kira. There was another woman with me. She also came to take back her grandson.' Recalling the moment he saw Kira, looking healthy in jeans and a sweater, Alexsandr said: 'We were very emotional, both of us.' The reunited pair took the same route back to Kyiv, arriving on 26 April. Kira was then admitted to Ohmatdyt children's hospital where Zelenskiy made a surprise visit and gave her his gift. Alexsandr has not talked to Kira about the death of her father. 'She doesn't like taking about that, and I also don't want to discuss unnecessarily,' he said. 'Psychotherapists are working with her. She is OK considering what she lived through.' For now, the future is the focus. 'Yes, I adopted her and I'm her official guardian now, so she'll live with me, we'll be together,' Alexsandr said. 'We'll stay in Chernivtsi [a city in south-western Ukraine] for now, and I don't know what [the] future holds for us. We'll see how life turns out.'", "5faa7d2a48c8fe711c789d762db5a31152ae5278e0a95227ebcf180f": "", "5fe36df16167d8b18e8f1cfb18db148920623290c24185c6ba03ffac": "Ukrainians are inking the fight for their country on to their bodies, with artists getting requests for tattoos of molotov cocktails, anti-tank missiles and even a type of bread that has become an unlikely symbol of national identity because Russians struggle to pronounce it. As people filtered back to Kyiv after Russian troops abandoned their attempts to seize it, tattoo artists noticed an increasing demand for art that paid tribute to this spring of tragedy and violence, and to Ukraine's spirit of resistance. 'I wanted to capture this moment,' said Mariika, a tattoo artist who now has an anti-tank hedgehog on her leg and a molotov cocktail on her arm. She has stayed in Kyiv throughout the war, watching the tales she heard as a young girl become terrifying reality. 'I never thought I would live through something like this. My grandmother was a child of war, but her stories seemed so distant. Hiding in the basement from bombs is never something I thought would happen to me.' For several Saturdays she has joined a group of tattoo artists gathered in a Kyiv party district for a fundraising day at a nightclub, currently out of action because of the war and curfew. Other dancefloors have been commandeered as temporary headquarters for volunteers making camouflage netting, organising aid or preparing molotov cocktails. Anyone can turn up for a tattoo; the price is whatever they can afford to give the Ukrainian armed forces. No money changes hands, they just have to show a receipt for their donation. 'At the start of the war it was impossible to work, there were no clients and no moving around. But then people started asking about tattoos so we organised this event,' said Alexander, a 34-year-old artist with 11 years' experience. 'I collected my friends and each weekend more and more artists are taking part.' They have already raised more than 100,000 hryvnia (PS2,700) for the army and plan to keep going as long as there is demand and they have the needles and ink to meet it. Not all of the new designs are military-inspired. Some people want to forget the war, with tattoos of cats, and others want to mark the moment without direct reference to the war. 'I wanted to do a patriotic tattoo and I wanted to remember this period of time and the emotions associated with it, but I didn't want anything aggressive,' said Fedor, a 23-year-old IT manager who got the word palyanytsia - a traditional bread often eaten at special occasions - tattooed on his arm. Because Russians struggle to pronounce it, Ukrainians joke that the bread is an unofficial national 'password' to catch potential Russian spies. 'People will ask what that means and I will explain. I want to highlight Ukrainian identity.' Mariika said some people asked for symbols of their cities. One girl who had recently escaped Russian-controlled Kherson wanted a slice of the watermelon that her home city is famous for. Kyivites have asked for the chestnut leaf that is a symbol of the city. But others thrust into the violence of a brutal war want more explicit tributes to the way their lives have suddenly changed, including images of British next generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAWs) and US javelins. 'One man who shot NLAWs wanted a tattoo with a picture of one, a heart and the words 'NLAW in Love',' said Alexander. Early in the war he was also asked to do tattoos for an entire unit. 'Twelve people all wanted the same tattoo on their hands.' It was the trident - the national coat of arms - a silhouette of their group and its name. 'They came to me to do a tattoo at night because at that time Russians were super close to Kyiv and it was all very unsafe. One of them was 52 years old.' Civilians are also grappling with the reality of finding themselves on the frontline almost overnight. Nastya, 23, who works in McDonald's, got an image of a man throwing a molotov cocktail. 'For me it symbolises the resistance of my country,' she said. Mariika's husband, Oscar, who moved from Iceland when they married, has a new tattoo of an AK47 with a sunflower - the national flower - growing out of it. It is partly in tribute to an elderly woman who was filmed pressing packets of sunflower seeds on Russian soldiers to put in their pockets, saying the flowers would grow when they were killed in battle. 'I saw a video about sunflower seeds and I thought it is a good representation of the spirit of Ukrainians now,' he said. Other designs include the now-ubiquitous Ukrainian border guards' retort to a Russian ship that demanded their surrender, 'Russian warship, go fuck yourself', and an image of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy waving two guns.

Her parents, who cannot leave Ukraine due to their work, had arranged for Diana to live with her relative, Olenka Pevny, in the UK until the war was over. Pevny, a professor at the University of Cambridge, was assured twice by the Home Office that Diana would be able to come to Britain under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. She filed the paperwork on 24 March and flew to Poland the following week to collect her young relative. They have been waiting there ever since. Diana's application is among tens of thousands stuck in a byzantine system that charities say is worsening the trauma of those fleeing war. Pevny, 58, said she faced the prospect of having to send Diana back to Ukraine as she could no longer afford to stay in Poland. 'It cannot be right for a 12-year-old girl to leave a war zone and then, because the UK has a glitch in their visa scheme, have to go back to a war zone where Russians are committing war crimes against children and mothers,' she said. 'We're reading about all these mothers and children, who are Diana's age, who are being raped around Kyiv. Can I actually as a human being return this child to Ukraine?' Pevny was told twice by the Home Office to apply to host Diana under the Homes for Ukraine scheme because, as a distant relative, she would not qualify as a close family member, although they are incredibly close as families and celebrate all their holidays together. But weeks after submitting an application under Homes for Ukraine, she found out that the rules had changed so that unaccompanied under-18s could not be brought to Britain. The safeguarding reasons behind this may be sound, but the change was not publicised or communicated to Pevny, who only found out when her MP, Daniel Zeichner, looked into her case. She now faces another long wait as her application is rerouted to the family scheme, with no prospect of success. Pevny said Diana was 'traumatised' by the process: 'She thinks that the UK does not want her. She thinks that I will leave her in Poland or send her back to the war zone. There must be a better way for the UK to help innocent children who are victims of the Russian war of aggression.' Charlie Richards, a market research consultant, has found himself managing visa applications on behalf of 22 Ukrainians who fled their homeland when Russia invaded. The group consists of six families of people aged from three years old to 70. They are scattered across Europe as they approach their sixth week of waiting for the green light to travel to the UK. Richards, 35, discovered on 4 April that more than half of his 22 applicants had been approved for visas but had not received them. He learned this only because Home Office officials visited a Ukrainian cultural centre near his home in Reading, so he asked them to check the status of their applications. They had been approved, some weeks ago, but never sent. He was astonished; the Home Office officials looked concerned. They came back four days later after looking into the issue. 'They recognised it was a problem,' Richards said. The government only officially acknowledged the problem on Thursday, the day parliament was prorogued. Potentially thousands of people could have arrived in the UK weeks ago if their visas had been dispatched as soon as they had been approved. Three of Richards' cases received visas 16 days after they were authorised. But that family are still in limbo halfway across Europe because three of their group are still waiting for their paperwork. Richards said the UK had 'fundamentally let down a group of people we should have been there for as a country'. He added: 'When you see that tens of thousands of people have supposedly been granted visas but haven't got here yet, it's impossible not to think the problem could be that widespread.' Alexandra, a Ukrainian refugee, said she was at a loss to understand why she has had to wait six weeks for a straightforward visa application to be processed. She fled Kherson and her visa application was lodged on the day the scheme opened, 18 March. 'I feel like it's a joke and a game from government for us,' she said. 'It makes me so mad, the suspense and zero information. I don't think they realise what we have been through.' Since fleeing Kherson with only her passport and a few items of clothing, Alexandra has been on a dangerous journey passing through Russia, Turkey and Bulgaria to get to Romania, where she is waiting for her visa to come through. A home is waiting for her in Warwickshire, where she has been sponsored by Daniel Edwards. But still the wait goes on. 'I've exhausted so many different options trying to get in touch with MPs, the Home Office helpline, the visa office but there are still no results and no hope,' said Edwards. 'The woman I'm sponsoring has been on such a dangerous journey from border to border. The visa should have arrived at least four weeks ago. It's an absolute disgrace that it's now more than 40 days since the original application.'", "d1ef84ab95ea54e50f586a26b68a4ced5adf2ae5efe1e9986e55d6c5": "Some Pacific island nations have been left walking a geopolitical tightrope in their response to the war in Ukraine, as they try to balance regional alliances with both the west and China and Russia. Comments by Russian president Vladimir Putin, which many have interpreted as thinly veiled threats about the potential use of nuclear weapons have also touched a nerve in a region long affected by the catastrophic effects of nuclear weapons testing by the US, France and Britain. Pacific leaders have broadly lambasted the Russian assault, with the Federated States of Micronesia even going so far as to sever diplomatic ties with Russia the day after the invasion was launched. Micronesia's president David Panuelo accused Moscow of engaging in 'numerous war crimes,' writing, 'There is no nuance in Russia's behaviour; they are choosing to act as villains.' In Fiji, where the acceptance of donated Russian arms and military training in 2016 raised concerns, the high court ruled last month that the government in Suva was within its rights to prevent a super yacht called Amadea, from leaving the Fijian port where it is docked while a US seizure application is determined. The US alleges the yacht is owned by Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, who is the subject of US and European economic sanctions. Defence lawyers dispute that. Ten Pacific island nations were also among 93 countries that voted to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council last month. Two Pacific states, however, did not. Vanuatu abstained and Solomon Islands did not vote. Mihai Sora, a research fellow with the Lowy Institute and former Australian diplomat, noted that Melanesian countries have tried to develop relations with both western powers as well as China and Russia, seeking to avoid appearing too close to either side. 'Solomon Islands and Vanuatu stand out as two Pacific countries that have been actively pursuing closer relations with China at the political level in recent years,' Sora said. Beijing has abstained on UN security council resolutions condemning the war and has also echoed, and amplified, Kremlin talking points in official media outlets, blaming Nato for the conflict. This month Solomon Islands signed a security pact with China which could allow for Chinese security personnel and warships to enter the country to protect Chinese interests. In recent years, Sora said, analysts have also seen Vanuatu as a potential host for a Chinese military base, despite denials by both nations. Vanuatu, Sora added, has also maintained closer ties to Russia relative to other Pacific nations. In 2011, it briefly established diplomatic relations with Abkhazia, a breakaway region in the Caucasus nation of Georgia, aligning itself with Russian interests. 'By abstaining on the human rights council vote, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu may be seeking to have it both ways,' Sora said, suggesting the two countries don't want to entirely contradict China or Russia, nor do they want to run counter to Australia, New Zealand, and the rest of the Pacific. Neither the UN missions for Vanuatu or Solomon Islands responded to requests for comment. In the early days of the war, Putin put Russia's nuclear forces on high alert and as his offensive shifts to Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, he has overseen the testing of a Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, describing it as 'food for thought for those who ... try to threaten our country'. Casten Nemra, minister of foreign affairs in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), where the US conducted 67 nuclear tests in the 1940s and 50s, said Putin's references to nuclear weapons were 'utterly irresponsible and sheer madness'. 'Nuclear weapons bring nothing but total destruction ... even many decades later, we continue to this day [to] experience the negative effects on our environment, health, and communities.' The country also co-founded the Group of Friends of Accountability with Ukraine and four other UN member states aimed at 'ensuring accountability for international crimes committed following the Russian invasion of Ukraine'. In French Polynesia, where France carried out 193 nuclear tests between 1966 and 1996, Putin's comments are also a reminder of the true cost of nuclear weapons and colonial conquest. Vehia Wheeler, a Tahiti-based environmental and human rights activist, said that it was absurd that there was still talk of the use of nuclear weapons in 2022 'after all the work that people have been doing and have been working towards, reparations, preventing [nuclear weapons] from being used, that this is even an option.' However, she said the UN vote to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council smacked of hypocrisy. 'I think that's really interesting that the UN will vote against Russia, kicking them out of the Human Rights Council when obviously the US and France have been horrendous human rights violators considering the fact that they've already conducted nuclear tests on us in the Pacific for years,' Wheeler said.", "9cab2ac392bb0373c70c830547054ffbf183b205cf9c401e8cb443ac": "Chief Justice John Roberts said moments ago that the supreme court's marshal will investigate the source of the leak of the draft opinion on abortion, which is genuine and was published late Monday, and slammed the 'egregious breach of trust'. In what is regarded as an unprecedented leak, of a draft majority opinion to overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade decision legalizing the right to an abortion in America, Roberts was not among the five names listed in the majority. In the court's first public reaction since the scoop by Politico, Roberts said: 'Although the document described in yesterday's reports is authentic, it does not represent a decision by the Court or the final position of any member on the issues in the case.' In a statement, he added: 'To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed.' Furious women surged to the steps of the US supreme court to decry news in a leaked document indicating that the conservative-controlled court intends to overturn abortion rights provided nationally under the 1973 Roe vs Wade ruling. Protesters rushed to demonstrate outside the building's majestic marble columns in Washington DC just minutes after the news broke late on Monday night, and more were there on Tuesday, with larger protests planned. Anti-abortion demonstrators prayed and celebrated but pro-choice protesters lit candles, chanted in support of reproductive rights and shouted expletives about Samuel Alito, the rightwing justice on the court who wrote the opinion that was leaked to Politico. Under cloudy skies that threatened rain on Tuesday, Haley Lund, from Woodbridge, Virginia, held a sign, standing in front of a metal gate guarding the last step in front of the court, which said: 'Abortion is healthcare.' 'This terrifies me. I could not sleep, so I figured I should be here, where it could possibly make a difference or at least make someone aware,' she told the Guardian. 'It's an important issue for me because of women's reproductive rights, but this opens a floodgate for everyone ... like the right to privacy, to due process, the right that we're innocent until proven guilty. All of that can go away if this goes away,' she added. Anti-abortion activists chanted: 'Hey, hey, ho, ho, Roe v Wade has got to go', leading to tense exchanges between the two groups. Barriers were erected in front of the court shortly after the leaked report was made public. Robin Galbraith, of Maryland, told the Guardian on Tuesday: 'I'm the mother of two twentysomething children, and I've been fighting for healthcare rights, abortion rights, since I was 20 and I did not bring my children into this world to have their rights taken away.' She added that she was retired and could normally sleep in but on Tuesday launched herself out of bed at 5am to get to the court to protest, she was so motivated, and if the final decision - expected from the court in June when they announce the main decisions from their previous term - overturns Roe that she would be out campaigning to help the Democrats keep and increase their hold of the US Senate. The size and vociferousness of the crowds are more usual just before or just after a major supreme court decision. The Guardian's protests picture gallery. White House press secretary Jen Psaki is talking to reporters now on Air Force One as she accompanies Joe Biden to Alabama, where the US president is visiting a Lockheed Martin facility that is manufacturing weapons that are currently being supplied to Ukraine in its efforts to repel the Russian advance after its neighbor invaded in February. By the way, for full coverage of the war in Ukraine, please click on our global live blog, which Guardian teams are running around the clock. Of course Psaki is immediately asked by reporters aboard today's flight about more on Biden's reaction to the Roe news, and his noting, when he spoke on the tarmac near Washington earlier, that there has been much riding on the US Congress to pass legislation entrenching the right to an abortion in federal legislation. Psaki pointed out that there has only very recently been a vote in congress on the relevant legislation - the Women's Health Protection Act (WHPA).  'There has been a vote on this, it failed,' she said. In March, West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin sided with Republicans to vote down the bill. So Psaki said that even if Democrats acted to change the filibuster, which requires a 60-vote majority in the Senate to pass most legislation, with Manchin opposed they would not even have had a simple majority to pass the WHPA. The US Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrat and Republican seats (with Dems having the edge in situations where a simple majority is fine, such as a supreme court nomination or certain types of financial legislation, via the swing vote of the president of the Senate, vice president Kamala Harris). Nevertheless, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has just announced that he will bring the bill up for another vote. It will fail, especially without a change in the filibuster rule, but Democrats are now keen to get lawmakers on the record on where they stand in relation to abortion rights. Psaki said that Biden would be very happy to sign the bill into law if it could get through congress. She emphasized that the burden of abortion bans in US states primarily falls on low wealth women of color. Health and human services secretary Xavier Becerra has condemned as 'dangerous' the supreme court's draft ruling and attacks nationwide on abortion rights. In statement posted to the HHS website, Becerra listed the steps the Biden administration had taken to support women and preserve their reproductive rights: Becerra noted the health and human services department had launched a task force on reproductive health care and committed more than $250m for equitable family planning services.  The leaked US supreme court draft ruling is making waves overseas. My colleague Libby Brooks in Glasgow writes: The leaked Roe document has sharpened calls for buffer zones around abortion providers in Scotland, as first minister Nicola Sturgeon stated that 'the right of women to decide what happens to our own bodies is a human right'. Sturgeon tweeted: 'Experience tells us that removing the legal right to abortion doesn't stop abortions happening - it just makes them unsafe and puts the lives of women at much greater risk. Campaigners and opposition politicians have called on Sturgeon's government to act immediately to create buffer zones to protect women seeking abortions targeted by anti-choice protesters. Back Off Scotland co-founder Lucy Grieve said that Sturgeon's outrage 'goes only so far'. 'There are real, tangible threats to abortion access in Scotland that are going unchallenged by her government,' she said. 'The women's health minister, Maree Todd, claims that she wants Scotland to be world leading on women's healthcare, yet her inaction is emboldening these protestors. If she cannot show courage and legislate on this issue, then she must step aside for somebody that will.' Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell, the rival party leaders in the US Senate, gave their contrasting opinions about the supreme court abortion leak on the chamber floor this morning. Schumer, the Democratic majority leader, promised to bring a vote on abortion rights to the senate floor: McConnell, the Republican minority leader, echoed his statement from earlier in the day, and was more interested in talking about the impact of the leak, urging justices to ignore the Democratic outcry: The California Democrat Adam Schiff has added his voice to those condemning the supreme court's draft ruling on abortion. In comments to the Guardian contributor Charles Kaiser, Schiff, a prominent congressman, said: In a subsequent tweet, Schiff called on the Senate to act to enshrine women's right to abortion into law. Kaiser, author of The Gay Metropolis, a history of gay life in the US, blasted Samuel Alito, the supreme court justice who authored the now-confirmed draft ruling: Chief Justice John Roberts said moments ago that the supreme court's marshal will investigate the source of the leak of the draft opinion on abortion, which is genuine and was published late Monday, and slammed the 'egregious breach of trust'. In what is regarded as an unprecedented leak, of a draft majority opinion to overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade decision legalizing the right to an abortion in America, Roberts was not among the five names listed in the majority. In the court's first public reaction since the scoop by Politico, Roberts said: 'Although the document described in yesterday's reports is authentic, it does not represent a decision by the Court or the final position of any member on the issues in the case.' In a statement, he added: 'To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed.' Joe Biden has just spoken to reporters about the staggering abortion news, while on his way from the White House to take a flight to Alabama to review the making of heavy weapons destined for Ukraine. The US president said of the leaked provisional decision, essentially, that: 'If this decision holds, it's really quite a radical decision ... it's a fundamental shift in American jurisprudence.' He also said that if this is the final decision that it has implications for 'every decision in your private life' and will affect choices about who you may marry, whether you use contraception and family planning, how you raise your children. More fully, Biden said: 'It basically says all the decisions you make in your private life, who you marry, whether or not you decide to conceive a child, whether or not you can have an abortion, and a range of other decisions ... how you raise your child. Does this mean that in Florida they can decide to pass a law saying that same-sex marriage is not permissible, it's against the law in Florida? It's a fundamental shift in American jurisprudence.' We'll have more on the president's words in a few moments. And also the latest from supreme court chief justice John Roberts. Stand by. The pro-choice group Women's March, which formed to organize the record protests that took place in Washington and elsewhere the day after Donald Trump's presidential inauguration in 2017, is urging supporters to hold rallies all across the country. In a statement, the group said: The group is encouraging protests outside the supreme court, which sits near the US Capitol, on Tuesday during the day and more demonstrations outside 'federal courthouses, federal buildings, town halls and town squares across the country' in the evening. And two separate pro-choice marches are set to be staged by protestors in New York City on Tuesday evening, while a rally will be held in San Francisco. Norma Gallegos, an organizer of the San Francisco protest, said the court's 'devastating attack on legal abortion is a call to hit the streets throughout the land'.  Read more: Respected supreme court analysts Carl Tobias and Laurence Tribe have been sharing their thoughts. Tobias, law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, believes there are more developments to come: Tribe, a Harvard law professor, pointed to possible wider implications of the ruling by Justice Samuel Alito, if it stands as the court's opinion: Mitch McConnell, the senate minority leader, has issued a statement concentrating on the leak of the supreme court's draft decision on abortion rights, rather than its content. The Kentucky Republican slammed 'the radical left' he accuses of attacking the court's independence: Here's a brief statement from Susan Collins, Republican senator for Maine, about the leak of the supreme court's draft decision. Collins, one of the more moderate Republicans in the chamber, explained her votes to confirm Donald Trump picks Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh as supreme court justices in 2017 and 2018 respectively by stressing they had given her assurances that they saw Roe v Wade as 'settled law', and that she had full confidence they would not vote to overturn it. Collins did not subsequently vote to confirm Trump's third and final pick, Amy Coney Barrett, in 2020, with analysts noting her vote was not crucial. Justifying her decision to back Kavanaugh in a lengthy 2018 statement, Collins said she had received his guarantee that he saw long-established law as stare decisis, which binds courts to follow legal precedents set by previous decisions, and 'not something to be trimmed, narrowed, discarded, or overlooked.' Collins wrote: 'I asked Judge Kavanaugh whether the passage of time is relevant to following precedent. He said decisions become part of our legal framework with the passage of time and that honoring precedent is essential to maintaining public confidence'.  Democrats failed in March to enshrine abortion rights into federal law, their attempt fueled by rapidly spreading restrictions passed by state legislatures across the country. The Democratic West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin joined Republicans to block the bill in the US Senate, the effort falling 14 votes short of the 60 needed. While Democrats expected the bill to fail, they said brought the measure forward at a perilous moment for abortion rights to ensure votes were recorded.  'Abortion is a fundamental right and women's decisions over women's healthcare belong to women, not to extremist rightwing legislators,' said the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, at the time. With nothing having changed in the Senate, any further attempts to nullify the reported supreme court decision through legislation look certain to fail.  Manchin is the key figure in the divided 50-50 chamber, and he is on record as stating he would not support eliminating the filibuster, the procedural process that requires at least 60 senators for legislation to advance. Here's my colleague Jessica Glenza's story from March: The White House has just released this statement from Joe Biden: We're waiting for the first reaction from the White House to today's reported supreme court leak, which could come in the form of an official statement, or snatched words with reporters from Joe Biden on the south lawn as the president departs for a trip to a missile production factory in Alabama a little later this morning. The vice-president, Kamala Harris, is also likely to have plenty to say at tonight's We Are Emily conference and gala in Washington DC, an event celebrating 'women taking the lead in defending our democracy and our right to reproductive freedom'. While we wait, here's a look back at Biden's forthright comments from last year, when he condemned the US supreme court's 'unprecedented assault' on abortion rights following its decision not to block extreme legislation from Texas: Here are some Twitter reactions to the supreme court news from politicians of both parties. Raphael Warnock, Democratic senator for Georgia: Elizabeth Warren, Democratic senator for Massachusetts: Michael Bloomberg, Democratic former mayor of New York: Marco Rubio, Republican senator for Florida: Eric Swalwell, Democratic congressman for California: Hillary Clinton, Democratic former senator for New York, and former presidential candidate: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic congresswoman for New York: Gavin Newsom, Democratic governor of California: Ted Cruz, Republican senator for Texas:", "e4eb320d9f4a3329e5ed1d20260bcca40db4a865d312e170d528ee90": "People who have been hospitalised with Covid may be left with difficulties in thinking comparable in magnitude to ageing 20 years, research suggests. As the pandemic swept the world it became apparent that coronavirus could not only cause immediate health problems but also leave some people with often debilitating symptoms - a condition known as long Covid. According to one UK study, about a third of patients who experienced symptoms after being hospitalised felt fully recovered a year later, with little improvement for most patients in areas including physical function and cognitive impairment. Now experts have revealed that some patients were left with, on average, a lingering cognitive decline. David Menon, a professor at Cambridge University and senior author of the study, said the degree of impairment was linked to the severity of illness. '[Covid] does cause problems with a variety of organs in the body, including the brain and our cognitive function and our psychological health,' he said. 'If you can have a vaccine, and all your doses, you will have less severe illness. So all of these problems are going to be less.' Writing in the eClinicalMedicine journal, Menon and colleagues report how they examined the results of cognitive tests performed by 46 patients, on average six months after they were admitted to Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge between March and July 2020. Of this group, 16 received mechanical ventilation. The cognitive tests were carried out via the Cognitron platform, developed by researchers at Imperial College London, which formed the basis of the BBC's Great British Intelligence Test. The team compared the results with those of 460 people who took part in the BBC challenge and who had never had Covid. Ten people were matched for each patient according to characteristics such as age, gender, education and first language. The results suggest those who were hospitalised with Covid had particular cognitive impairments, including slower processing speed. 'The thing they struggle with most is verbal reasoning,' said Menon, noting that included completing analogies such as laces are to shoes what buttons are to coat. The study suggests that while the cognitive impairments were distinct, the magnitude of the change was, on average, on a par with the cognitive decline seen as people age from 50 to 70 years old. The team found no strong difference in the level of cognitive impairment between those who completed the tests six months after hospital admission and patients tested at 10 months, although there were hints of an improvement. The will return for further tests to see if a stronger association has emerged. Menon added that investigating cognitive decline in Covid patients may not only help them but also those who experienced similar problems after other illnesses. 'The trials that we will be able to conduct will allow us to understand the underlying mechanisms and produce effective treatments to prevent it happening and perhaps treat it later,' he said.", "100a73b97de1cc4c0864a4672e971d274b81f492a2c92f4d2ccb14e9": "Three children in Indonesia have died from a mysterious liver disease, the country's health ministry has said, raising the global death toll to at least four. A severe type of acute hepatitis has been identified in almost 170 children across 11 countries in recent weeks, raising concerns from the World Health Organization (WHO) of the disease's 'unknown origin'. The symptoms afflicting the children before signs of liver inflammation have included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. At least one death was previously reported. Indonesia's health ministry said three children had died in hospitals last month in the capital, Jakarta, after displaying some of the symptoms. The children, aged two, eight and 11, also had fever, jaundice, convulsions and loss of consciousness, said the ministry's spokesperson Siti Nadia Tarmizi. 'At the moment, we suspect the cases as acute hepatitis, but we need to confirm that they are not due to known hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D, and Rb,' Tarmizi said. She added that the health ministry was currently investigating the cause of the disease by running a full panel of virus tests. The ministry also called on parents to immediately take their children to hospital if they showed any sign of the symptoms. The emergence of a possible new disease afflicting only young children - most are under 10 years old with no underlying conditions - has caused concern in a global health community already grappling with Covid-19. The WHO said that there was an 'unexpected significant increase' in cases in the UK among young, previously healthy children, as well as in Ireland and the Netherlands. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a study on Friday on a cluster in Alabama, where nine children also tested positive for a common pathogen called adenovirus 41. The pathogen is known to cause gastroenteritis in children, but 'it is not usually known as a cause of hepatitis in otherwise healthy children', the agency said. Adenoviruses are commonly spread by close personal contact, respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces. There are more than 50 types of adenoviruses, which most commonly cause colds but also many other diseases.", "86dc282ab58d635a18df64c6aa2ed9957f6e6a97994053d84d2d2002": "Obesity has reached 'epidemic proportions' in Europe, the World Health Organization says, as a major report shows the disease is causing 200,000 cancer cases and 1.2 million deaths a year. In the first such study for 15 years, the WHO said overweight and obesity rates had hit deadly levels and were 'still escalating'. No country in the region was on track to meet the WHO global noncommunicable disease (NCD) target of halting the rise of obesity by 2025, it said. Across Europe, 59% of adults are overweight or obese as well as 8% of children under five and one in three children of school age. Obesity prevalence in Europe is higher than in any other part of the world except the Americas, according to the report presented at the European Congress on Obesity. 'Alarmingly, there have been consistent increases in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the WHO European region and no member state is on track to reach the target of halting the rise in obesity by 2025,' the report said. Obesity is linked to a string of other diseases, including musculoskeletal complications, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and at least 13 types of cancer. The report said excess body fat led to premature death and was a leading risk factor for disability. 'Across the WHO European region, obesity is likely to be directly responsible for at least 200,000 new cancer cases annually, with this figure projected to rise in the coming decades,' the report said. 'For some countries within the region, it is predicted that obesity will overtake smoking as the main risk factor for preventable cancer.' Of all the countries in the Europe region, the UK ranks fourth for having the most overweight and obese adults, behind Israel, Malta and Turkey, according to the study. On obesity rates alone, the UK is second only to Malta. Obesity is defined as being very overweight. Having a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 is classified as being overweight, while 30 or above is defined as obese. The report found European men were more likely to be overweight or obese overall, although more women were living with obesity (24%) in Europe than men (22%). People living with obesity had been disproportionately affected by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the report said. There have been unfavourable shifts in food consumption and physical activity patterns that will have lasting effects on people's health for many years and will need significant effort to reverse. The report said the causes of obesity were more complex than just an unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. It said that 'environmental factors unique to living in modern Europe's highly digitalised societies are also drivers of obesity', such as online marketing of unhealthy food to children, and the 'proliferation of sedentary online gaming'. Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe, said reversing the obesity epidemic in Europe was still possible. 'By creating environments that are more enabling, promoting investment and innovation in health, and developing strong and resilient health systems, we can change the trajectory of obesity in the region.' The report called for high-level political commitment to tackling obesity, alongside measures such as sugar taxes on sugary drinks and subsidies on healthy food. Marketing of unhealthy food to children must end, it said.", "946deccf8251a08a67c4c4328d6060d3aa3733f7db636deb7eb6f46e": "A record 28 countries are rated 'very bad' places for journalism in the World Press Freedom Index, which warns that autocratic regimes are increasingly willing to crack down on independent media outlets. Billions of people in countries including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan struggle to access journalism produced without intervention from politicians, with reporters in these places often facing threats to their wellbeing. The annual press freedom list, produced by the campaign group Reporters Without Borders, surveys the state of the media in 180 countries and territories. It blames 'globalised and unregulated online information space that encourages fake news and propaganda' for the worsening situation in many countries. One of the biggest fallers on the list is Myanmar, where dozens of journalists have been put in jail since last year's military coup. Reporters Without Borders said press freedom in the country had been set back by 10 years. The organisation's campaign chief, Rebecca Vincent, said that although the UK ranked a relatively healthy 24th on the list, concerns remained. Key issues include ongoing threats to journalists in Northern Ireland after the killing of Lyra McKee, the government's attempts to install a political ally as chair of the media watchdog Ofcom, and the ongoing extradition process involving the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. She said: 'The Assange case is globally important and the UK government is enabling the US government to pursue this case against him. It is also becoming increasingly difficult for journalists of all stripes to access information from this government.' Vincent said weak press freedom left citizens uninformed and less able to hold their governments to account. She warned that authoritarian attitudes towards the media could often spill over into other neighbouring countries, adding: 'The war in Ukraine is an extreme example of that - it was a premeditated information war that has turned into a conflict that threatens global security.' Europe is split in two on the rankings, with Nordic countries such Norway, Denmark and Sweden once again topping the list and receiving praise for following a 'democratic model where freedom of expression flourishes'. The situation in eastern Europe is much worse, with Poland, Hungary and Albania all scoring relatively badly. The lowest-ranked European country for press freedom is Greece, which slips to 108th in the ranking after the crime journalist Giorgos Karaivaz was gunned down on a street in Athens. The annual ranking has been put together for the last 20 years and is created by assessing direct threats against journalists around the world and combining it with the results of a survey of hundreds of journalists, academics and human rights activists. Among the worst performers is Hong Kong, which has plummeted to 148th after the introduction of a national security law that targets journalists critical of the Chinese government. Russia received one of the lowest rankings after the Kremlin established 'complete control of news and information by establishing extensive wartime censorship, blocking the media and pursuing non-compliant journalists, forcing many of them into exile'. 1.

The British Foreign Office minister Amanda Milling was greeted with street protests on Monday as she met BVI politicians and civil society to discuss the possible move to press ahead with direct rule as recommended by a commission of inquiry report last week. The commission, headed by a retired British judge, Sir Gary Hickinbottom, found that corruption and misgovernment was so rife that a partial suspension of the constitution and closure of the national assembly for two years was required. But the proposal has been firmly opposed by BVI politicians, including the acting premier, Natalio Wheatley, who took office after his predecessor Andrew Fahie, 51, was arrested on drug-running charges in Miami last week. On Tuesday, the seven-strong Organisation of East Caribbean States (OECS) issued a firm warning against the move, saying in a statement: 'It is ill-advised to impose direct colonial rule and the history of such imposition in the Caribbean has never delivered the desired result. 'The OECS concurs with the elected representatives of the people of the BVI that abolition of parliament with direct rule from London represents a retrograde step in the evolution of the democratic process that is inconsistent with the United Nations proclamation of human rights to be free of colonial rule. 'The historical responsibility for strengthening governance in the BVI must rest on the shoulders of the elected representatives and the people of the BVI themselves. That ultimately will be the guarantee of good governance and full, transparent accountability. 'The UN declaration on granting independence to colonial countries and peoples - resolution 1514 of 1960 - is an international commitment to which Britain is itself bound.' The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, will have to balance the political turbulence of the former colonial power taking complete charge of the overseas territory against the commission's clear assessment that the island's governance has over many years become riddled with corruption. The demonstrations on Monday were a test of whether BVI society believes the arrest of Fahie and the damning findings in the report make it necessary for the UK government to take control while a full review of the BVI constitution is undertaken. The BVI governor, John Rankin, has not yet expressed a view on whether the commission of inquiry recommendations should be implemented, but the commission was established by the governor's predecessor and it would be striking if its unequivocal chief recommendation was rejected by the British government. Fahie, who is being held in a Miami prison pending a bail hearing, has demanded his immediate release on the basis that as prime minister he can claim diplomatic immunity to arrest and detention. He was arrested on Thursday after he met agents from the US Drug Enforcement Administration who were posing as Mexican drug traffickers and allegedly agreeing to take $700,000 in return for waving through a cocaine shipment on its way to the US. Fahie's lawyers have filed a claim in the Southern District of Florida that diplomatic immunity is conferred on him by virtue of his election as BVI prime minister in February 2019. Christopher Malcolm, a former BVI attorney general, said that the BVI constitution does not describe the BVI as a distinct state. He added: 'BVI leaders have no diplomatic status or diplomatic passport. Fahie and his lawyers are clutching at a straw that cannot carry his weight.' If the UK government does impose direct rule, ministers in Whitehall will oversee the introduction of a public register of beneficial ownership of shares on the islands - something the Fahie government has been reluctant to introduce. The BVI is one of the world's major tax havens and nearly half of the companies named in the recent Pandora Papers investigation were registered in the BVI. The Hickinbottom report reveals the extent to which the BVI government is dependent on financial services for its income. Nearly 55% of the BVI total government budget of PS360m in 2020 was provided by fees from financial services. The commission also found that 'Since November 2020, the Royal Virgin Islands police force has recovered over 3.6 tons of cocaine, with an estimated street value higher than the annual BVI GDP. It is thought that huge quantities of drugs pass through the BVI undetected. There is also substantial evidence that, despite efforts such as those described briefly above, BVI companies are regularly used in the laundering of colossal amounts of illicit funds'.", "412e4dbcc722bbb75fac10a62ce04f35de662ed61b3347d8eab40ed2": "Six people are under investigation in Shanghai after an elderly nursing home resident was mistakenly declared dead, put in a body bag and taken by coroners to a waiting van before mortuary workers noticed they were still alive.  The incident, which took place on Sunday afternoon, was filmed by onlookers and footage quickly spread online, sparking a furious backlash in the city which has been under a gruelling lockdown for five weeks. It also prompted concerns over the city's overwhelmed medical system. In the footage, workers wearing protective clothing are seen pulling a bodybag out of the mortuary van on to a trolley. They look inside the bag before realising the person inside is alive. 'Alive! Did you see that? Alive!' says one. 'Do not cover him again!' says another. One worker goes to speak with people wearing protective suits outside the building, and the elderly patient is wheeled back inside. The incident was confirmed by the Putuo district government, which said that investigations had begun. The Shanghai Supervisory Commission and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said five officials, including the director of the care home and a doctor, had been stood down and put under investigation. Another local Party official was reprimanded. Shanghai Xinchangzheng Nursing Home has apologised, while the funeral home reportedly praised its employees for noticing the person was still alive, and rewarded them with 5,000 yuan (PS600) each. State media said the elderly patient had been transferred to hospital and was receiving treatment. The incident shocked people in China, where a wave of Omicron is challenging the government's commitment to zero-Covid measures including strict lockdowns and mass testing. It is also testing the resolve and trust of residents. 'What if this incident was not captured by the citizens of Shanghai?' said one commenter on a state media report. 'Care homes and nursing homes will be the last places for many elderly people, especially some lonely elderly people who have no choice,' said another. 'Who would dare send their parents to a care home now? And who would dare to live in a nursing home with peace of mind?' Shanghai authorities had sought to avoid a lockdown but in early April backflipped on their assurances, sending about 25 million people inside. The lockdown has been plagued with issues including food shortages and delivery problems, and prompted protests both online and in people's homes and streets. Video has also circulated of a man who said he was a worker in Shanghai, walking on to a road to stop a truck and beg for food. 'Shanghai people, not one person cares about us. Take care of us! Expose this! Help me expose this! I am a worker. I'm going to starve to death!' he says, according to a translation by the Chuang blog. On Saturday authorities said more than 15 million residents were now able to leave their communities, with the spread of the virus mostly contained to people in quarantine facilities. However on Monday 58 new cases were detected among the free cohort of residents. Officials did not comment on the new cases, which prompted fear among some residents of more lockdowns or delays in the city reopening. On Sunday residents in Ningbo, south of Shanghai, were told they must obtain a negative test every 48 hours if they want to use public transport or enter public venues. In Beijing, authorities have also avoided implementing mass lockdowns, instead focusing on frequent testing of millions of people in at least a dozen districts and other strict measures. Restaurant dining, entertainment venues, and schools were closed, and travel restrictions imposed to and from the city ahead of the five-day May Day long weekend. Authorities reported 62 new cases on Monday. Overall, China reported 368 confirmed symptomatic cases and 5,647 asymptomatic cases. The vast majority - 274 and 5,395 respectively - were found in Shanghai. There are growing numbers of asymptomatic cases being detected across the country, including dozens in Liaoning, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Xinjiang.

After a period without significant numbers of crossings amid bad weather, several hundred of people made the journey in recent days, bringing the total to more than 7,000 so far this year. It is the first time this has happened since the passing of the nationalities and borders bill, which set out the policy framework. Asked if Boris Johnson was disappointed the plan had not as yet deterred such crossings, the prime minister's official spokesperson said that a series of legal challenges to the plan could be part of the reason. Asked when it would be possible to know if the policy was working, he said: 'I don't think there's a fixed date. Obviously, there are a number of variables we need to deal with, not least some of the legal challenges which have been talked about.' Questioned on whether he believed would-be asylum seekers in France were reading about the legal cases and thus deciding to risk the crossing, he said: 'I'm not seeking to prescribe motivation to individuals. I'm simply setting out some of the challenges that this policy has, that we expected from the start. And that's what we're seeing.' Under the plan, people who arrive in the UK via unofficial routes, such as on small boats crossing the Channel, could be deported to Rwanda. Their asylum claims would then be assessed with a view to remaining in the African country, with no prospect of living in the UK. In one pre-action letter sent to the Home Office, which is likely to lead to a judicial review claim, the solicitors Leigh Day stated that the charity Freedom from Torture 'has serious concerns about the lawfulness of the policy'. It has requested 'disclosure of information regarding the policy', including documents outlining it, risk assessments and the memorandum of understanding signed by the UK and Rwandan governments. When the policy was announced, the stated plan was for the first deportation flights to leave by the end of May. Asked about the timetable, Johnson's spokesperson said this had slipped. He said: 'We still aim to have the first flights leave in a matter of months, but because of some of those challenges it's hard to put an exact time on it.' The plan was, he said, 'to move ahead with this as soon as possible', but the government was 'not unexpectedly seeing some of these legal challenges, and in a free and democratic society we need to engage with those in the normal way. But we are still planning to move ahead with the flights at the earliest opportunity.'", "b8f368659db73e7724b6abb4dfab76530126fe09aab9a275494365c3": "Residents in several neighbourhoods in northern Rome have imposed a nightly 'curfew' after a spate of attacks by wild boar, which for years have roamed the Italian capital. In the most recent encounter, a woman said a boar 'was on top of my head' after she was pushed to the ground during an attack on Sunday night. The incident prompted exasperated residents of Balduina and six other districts to impose an 8.30pm curfew. 'On the [social media] chats between people in the district, and especially in group chats between people who have dogs, it is advised not to go out after 8.30pm,' Gianluca Sabino, a Balduina resident, told La Repubblica newspaper. 'Because at night, if somebody falls over or is hurt and nobody is around to help, then they could remain on the ground for who knows how long.' Franco Quaranta, the president of a residents' activist group in Aurelio, described the curfew as an act of 'self-protection' by citizens because the authorities had failed to take effective measures. 'This time the victim was an adult - but what if it happens to a child? With [the boars'] teeth, even just a bite to the leg is enough to jeopardise someone's life,' he said. Giovanni Mantovani, who runs a similar organisation in Monte Mario, said: 'These animals are getting closer and closer to people, and it's not just at night - they are walking the streets at all hours of the day.' The latest victim was Marta Santangelo, a psychotherapist, who was attacked by a boar beside a bin while walking her dog. 'It was just before 11pm ... I was carrying a bag of rubbish and by the bin I noticed boar cubs. The mother was fixating on me. I understood that maybe she was scared and so picked up my dog and ran for cover.' But as she tried to flee, Santangelo said she was attacked by the mother boar and fell to the ground. 'She was on my head ... I screamed and my dog defended me. There were seven piglets close by but they didn't attack.' Santangelo was picked up by a motorist and taken to hospital, where she was treated for minor injuries to her face and knee. In response to the attack, Rome authorities announced anti-boar measures, including fencing-off areas of natural park where the animals enter the city, and regularly collecting rubbish, particularly bins in areas close to the animals' main entrance points. Massimo Vetturi, the director of the wild animals unit at the animal rights organisation LAV, said boar attacked humans only if they felt there was a threat to their offspring or source of food. 'These are the two critical elements that can unleash an attack, from any wild animal, not just boar,' he said. 'But if a boar is close to an overflowing bin and a human approaches, it will act in a way to remove the threat to its essential food source. The real problem in Rome is that there has been no management of the problem.'", "d3e30d7e0a40d895246a223ff6d6d2e65c45b7d7b2270085fc443f1a": "A space company has briefly managed to catch a falling rocket using a helicopter and a hook in a test described by its chief executive as 'something of a supersonic ballet'. The test was part of Rocket Lab's attempts to find relatively low-cost ways of recovering rockets for multiple missions to space. After lifting off to send 34 satellites towards orbit at 10.50am local time (2350 BST) in New Zealand, the California-based company's four-storey-tall Electron booster stage fell back through Earth's atmosphere and deployed a series of parachutes to slow its speed. At high altitudes above the South Pacific, just off the New Zealand coast, a helicopter hanging a long, vertical cable from its underside was steered by two pilots over the booster, which had stretched a capture line at its side as it descended under a parachute at roughly 22mph (35km/h). The helicopter cable latched on to the booster's capture line, seen on the company's live stream, prompting cheers and applause from Rocket Lab engineers in the company's mission control centre in Long Beach. But the cheers turned to groans as the helicopter pilots were forced to release the rocket from the cable and drop it into the Pacific Ocean after noticing 'different load characteristics' than had been experienced during previous capture tests, a Rocket Lab spokesperson later said. Peter Beck, the founder and chief executive of Rocket Lab, said: 'Bringing a rocket back from space and catching it with a helicopter is something of a supersonic ballet. A tremendous number of factors have to align and many systems have to work together flawlessly, so I am incredibly proud of the stellar efforts of our recovery team and all of our engineers who made this mission and our first catch a success.' The rocket stage made a controlled splash down in the ocean after its brief capture. Onboard systems oriented the rocket to minimise damage from its impact with the water. It was then loaded on to a recovery vessel. Its condition will be assessed and a decision made as to whether to refurbish it for another flight. Reusing rocket stages significantly lowers the cost of reaching orbit. Catching them before they splash down removes the risk of damage from saltwater and the impact. The team will also review the brief capture to understand what happened and determine if changes are needed before the next midair helicopter attempt. Another Electron launch is scheduled for later this month.

Claire Enders, founder of Enders Analysis, said the super-rich have long sought to buy newspapers to help push their agendas and it was now possible to 'count on one hand the big media brands that aren't owned by an oligarch or other billionaire'.  'It's another sign that the super-wealthy wish to control assets that give them an extra level of power,' she said. 'Whatever they may say, that's the reason why they buy them. 'It is now unusual for major news media not to be owned by a billionaire, and that is why the Guardian [owned by the independent Scott Trust], the Financial Times [owned by the employee-owned Japanese media group Nikkei] and the BBC are consistently shown to be the most trusted news brands.' The billionaires who now control vast swathes of the media landscape include: The world's richest person struck a deal to buy Twitter - journalists' and politicians' preferred medium for sharing stories - for $44bn last week, promising to unleash its 'extraordinary potential' to boost free speech and democracy across the world. The Amazon founder and second-richest person in the world ($169bn compared with Musk's $252bn) bought the Washington Post for $250m in 2013. When Bezos took over, the Post was bleeding money and he said the business model was 'upside down'. He said of his decision to buy the paper: 'I had to do some soul-searching ... Is this something I want to get involved in? I started to realise this is an important institution. 'It is the newspaper in the capital city of the most important country in the world. The Washington Post has an incredibly important role to play in this democracy. There's no doubt in my mind about that.' Within three years the paper had doubled its internet traffic and turned a profit. 'I know that when I'm 90, it's going to be one of the things I'm most proud of, that I took on the Washington Post and helped them through a very rough transition,' Bezos said in an interview in 2018. The last standing of the original media barons, Murdoch took over running the News, a small Adelaide newspaper following his father's death in 1952. He expanded to a portfolio of newspapers across Australia, before entering the UK with the purchase of the News of the World in 1969. In the 1970s he moved to New York, buying up media assets starting with the New York Post. In 2017, Murdoch sold the bulk of his family's 21st Century Fox entertainment businesses to Walt Disney in a deal worth $66bn, but kept the newspapers and the right-wing US news channel Fox News. 'Are we retreating? Absolutely not,' he said at the time. 'We are pivoting at a pivotal moment.' Zuckerberg co-founded Facebook while studying psychology at Harvard University in 2004. Within a month, half of the undergraduate population had a profile. Now about 2.9 billion people - more than a third of the world's population - are signed up. Zuckerberg's social empire extends beyond Facebook to Instagram (which it bought in 2012) and WhatsApp (taken over in 2014). Late last year, Facebook changed its name to Meta to reflect the Zuckerberg's ambitions to dominate the 'metaverse' - which he says is 'the next frontier'. Zuckerberg, the world's 12th richest person with a $78bn fortune, controls 58% of the voting rights of Meta shares, effectively giving him personal control of all three platforms. The platforms have been accused of influencing the news stories that users are exposed to, and blamed for helping the spread of misinformation, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. The Russian oligarch and former KGB spy Alexander Lebedev is a part-owner of the investigative Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. In 2009, he bought the Standard for PS1, and the following year he bought the Independent for PS1. The titles are run by his son, Evgeny, and the family has pumped more than PS100m into the businesses. The Standard was a stalwart supporter of then-London mayor Boris Johnson, endorsing his 2012 reelection campaign. In 2015, Johnson and Lebedev camped out together on the streets of London to draw attention to homelessness among army veterans. When Johnson joked that he had fallen in a puddle, Lebedev quipped: 'I saved your life.' Evgeny was given a knighthood in 2020. Last week, Downing Street missed the deadline for publishing the security advice it received about granting the peerage, after Johnson denied intervening when intelligence services said it would be a security risk. Evgeny has since sold stakes in the newspapers but remains the largest single shareholder in them. Jonathan Harmsworth, a great-grandson of one of the Mail's co-founders, this year succeeded in taking the paper's owner, The Daily Mail and General Trust (DGMT), private after 90 years as a listed company by paying PS1.6bn for the 63% of the company he did not already own. Press Gazette estimated that he owns about 39% of the UK national newspapers sold every week in the UK, compared with 29% in 2010. This compares with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp on 27.5%, down from about 30% a decade earlier. The billionaire twins David and Frederick Barclay bought the Telegraph titles and the Spectator magazine in 2004. The brothers, who lived on the island of Brecqhou in the Channel Islands, previously owned The European, The Scotsman and the Sunday Business. David died last year. Frederick and his daughter, Amanda, had sued a group of David's relatives over allegations of bugging conversations at the Ritz hotel, which the brothers had previously owned. Italy's billionaire Agnelli family paid PS287m to increase its stake in the Economist to 43.4% in 2015 when Pearson sold its shares after selling the FT.

It is illegal for women to terminate their pregnancies in any circumstance in 24 countries, with a further 37 restricting access in any case except when the mother's life is in danger. As a leaked document signals that the US supreme court is poised to strike down the landmark 1973 ruling in Roe v Wade, millions of American women face losing their access to legal abortions, joining millions more living in those countries rejecting a woman's right to choose. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), unsafe abortions kill more than 47,000 people every year, with five million hospitalised for complications such as bleeding or infection. WHO data also shows that banning abortions has little or no effect on abortion rates throughout the world. Latin America has some of the world's most extreme anti-abortion laws. Abortion is illegal under any circumstances in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. Since 1998, at least 140 women in El Salvador, where abortion is punishable with up to 35 years imprisonment, have been charged under anti-abortion laws. Many of them had suffered a miscarriage. In Brazil, under the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, access to abortion - only legal in the country on the grounds of rape, severe foetal defects and women's health - has been curtailed. In 2020, the country introduced new legislation that requires medical staff to inform the police of rape survivors seeking the procedure. However, other countries on the continent have broadened access to legal abortions. In February, Colombia decriminalised abortion, while Chile signalled that wider access to abortions may be enshrined in its new constitution. In 2020, Argentina legalised abortion on request in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. Uruguay passed similar legislation, allowing abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy, in 2012. Africa has the highest death rate related to unsafe abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, with 92% of women of reproductive age in the region having restricted access to legal terminations. The Center for Reproductive Rights estimates that the deaths of up to 15,000 women a year could be prevented by improving access to safe abortions across the continent. In several countries, including Egypt, Democratic Republic of Congo and Senegal, abortion is completely illegal. According to the Association of Senegalese Women Lawyers, 19% of female prisoners in Senegal in 2015 were incarcerated on the grounds of abortion or infanticide. However, the number of African countries that allow abortion on request is growing. In 2021, Benin became the seventh country in the continent to legalise the procedure in the first trimester. Nearly all European countries offer legal abortions, yet it remains completely illegal in three microstates: Andorra, Malta and Vatican City. However, convictions in these countries remain rare. Poland is the only country where access to abortion is highly restricted. After a legislative ban was introduced in 2021, abortion can only be carried out when the pregnancy was caused by an illegal act, such as rape or incest, or when it threatens a woman's health. In reality, though, it is difficult to secure a legal abortion on the grounds of rape, with fewer than five legal abortions a year carried out for this reason. Even when a woman's health is at risk, doctors have become reluctant to carry out an abortion, leading to several deaths. In December, Poland also announced it is planning to introduce a centralised register of pregnancies that would oblige doctors to report all pregnancies and miscarriages to the government. In Romania, women are finding it increasingly difficult to access their legal right to abortion, with doctors refusing to provide the service. A 2019 survey found that only 25% of hospitals offered to carry out the procedure on request. According to the WHO, more than half of all unsafe abortions occur in Asia, most of them in south and central Asia. Abortion remains completely illegal in Laos and the Philippines. The Philippines' ban is still based on colonial-era laws introduced by the Spanish in 1870. An additional law passed in 1987 obliges the government to place equal weight on protecting the 'life of the unborn from conception' as on the life of the mother. Reproductive services are also severely curtailed, with emergency contraception, also known as the morning-after pill, banned across the country. A woman who has an abortion in the Philippines risks up to six years in prison. While there is no collected data on how many are convicted on abortion-related offences, reports of such cases in local media are not rare.", "efa3d794a6a3e8568ea69a631180b48251d1a281f3c00effa682b533": "The debate over whether Britain should introduce a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas companies has been reignited by bumper profits at BP. The one-off levy is among a suite of measures that have been proposed to tackle the energy crisis, which has sent household bills soaring. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated existing supply problems and left governments across Europe scrambling to protect consumers from the cost of living crunch. The Centre for Economics and Business Research has estimated that, without government intervention, energy costs could increase by 40% across the eurozone in 2022, up from a 13% rise in 2021. Deliberations over sanctions on Russian energy supplies and measures to limit the fallout of the conflict continue in Europe. In the UK, analysts have said bills could reach as much as PS3,000 a year in October, when the price cap is due to go up again, if wholesale gas prices do not fall. Here is how different governments across Europe have reacted. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been repeatedly criticised for acting slowly on tackling the energy crisis. The government has so far resisted calls from Labour and the Liberal Democrats to introduce a windfall tax on the profits of North Sea oil and gas operators, arguing that it would discourage investment in domestic energy supplies. In February, Sunak said 28m households will receive a PS200 discount on their bills from October. The cost will be recovered over the next five years. Ministers rejected calls for a cut on the 5% VAT rate on energy bills in favour of a one-off rebate of PS150 for households in England in council tax bands A-D. A further PS144m has been set aside to support vulnerable people and those on low incomes. The Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, on Monday laid out a EUR14bn (PS11.8bn) support package to tackle energy costs. His measures include subsidies for vulnerable families and a EUR200 cash payment for pensioners and those on low incomes. Draghi also found extra funds for local governments and will offer tax credits for energy-intensive industries. The measures come on top of the EUR20bn the cash-strapped nation has already spent on cushioning the impact of the energy price rise. The initiatives will be funded by a hike in Italy's windfall tax, introduced in January. The levy on energy industry profits will rise to 25% from 10%. Economists have warned that a sudden halt to Russian gas would trigger a 'sharp recession' in Germany. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has promised 'tangible relief' to citizens and last week unveiled a EUR30bn collection of measures. These include a temporary reduction in fuel taxes and cheaper, 90-day tickets to make public transport more affordable. The move builds on an existing EUR15bn relief package which involved an increase in the tax-free allowance for long-distance commuters. Berlin has also fast-tracked a revamp of legislation from 1975 aimed at handling energy shocks. The reworked bill will include measures to shut down companies during a gas shortage and strengthen EU security of supply regulations. Rules brought in five years ago state that EU members must help one another when gas supplies are tight. Spain's government was one of the first to take action to protect households against a sharp rise in energy bills. It agreed last September to remove taxes from home energy bills, which would instead be paid by enforcing a windfall tax on companies profiting from the surge in energy prices. A string of other measures have followed, including a ban on increasing gas bills by more than 5% for customers with lower energy consumption. Last week the European Commission agreed a price cap on gas for Spain and Portugal for 12 months. Consumers have been helped by a cut to VAT on energy bills and a reduction in a separate tax on electricity. Emmanuel Macron made energy policy a key pillar in his successful presidential re-election campaign. He said he would make France 'the first major nation to abandon gas, oil and coal' ahead of his win last month. In the short term, the French government has forced majority state-owned electricity supplier EDF Energy to lower costs. The operator, which is behind the Hinkley Point B nuclear power plant in the UK, told investors it would take a EUR8.4bn hit from the energy price cap, which meant it lowered the cost of electricity below the market rate. Electricity taxes have been reduced for households and businesses. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has estimated government efforts to curb costs since the Ukraine invasion are worth about EUR25bn. The Polish government has urged European counterparts to impose tough sanctions on Russia's oil and gas industry after gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland were cut last week by the Russian energy giant Gazprom. Both countries have said there is no immediate risk to supplies. Polish ministers have repeatedly intervened since late last year to protect households from the energy price hike. The prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, introduced an 'anti-inflation shield', cutting VAT on food and gas to 0%. A wider economic package, dubbed the 'anti-Putin shield', is being rolled out to support companies and jobs. The Dutch government was swift to act as the energy crisis began to escalate last year. Last October, energy taxes were cut for households and EUR150m was allocated to boosting home insulation. In March, the government raised a one-off energy allowance for low-income households by EUR600 to EUR800. The government has also lowered VAT on energy from 21% to 9% until the end of the year. Excise duties on petrol and diesel have been cut for the rest of 2022. In December, Norway's government set out a series of measures to help households totalling more than 8bn kroner (PS664m). Last month its parliament agreed an extension to a support scheme to tackle high electricity prices, worth EUR850m through to March 2023. Support for students and widows has also been ramped up. Sweden began introducing policies to tackle the energy crisis at the start of the year. These extended to compensation for households with high energy usage and fuel duty cuts. The government has also offered EUR6,700 in support for buying electric vehicles. Sweden is also expected to spend EUR48m on a housing allowance for families with children.", "6c6b49c88139d7aacfe63e8c37937e14215d0ea9fbf74c8d7b91890d": "Around a conference room table, young Taliban fighters quietly listen to an instructor teaching them how to behave with civilians. Awkwardly armed with notebooks and pens, most of the 25 fighters turned policemen have never been in a classroom before. They have spent most of their young lives as combatants in rural areas, and under their ample traditional outfits, their wrist-sized ankles betray how undernourished they are. 'What is the problem with bringing weapons inside a hospital?' trainer Raouf asks. 'People will be scared,' a young Taliban member answers. 'It will have a bad effect on sick people,' another says. This two-day class on international humanitarian law (IHL), organised by Geneva Call, a humanitarian organisation, takes place in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan. 'Did you ever bring your gun inside the hospital?' Raouf asks. All the fighters laugh. 'Yes,' they say, 'of course!' The rules of IHL can seem obvious: you cannot punish someone you arrest before they go to court; boys under 18 are children and should not fight; or 'if someone is not fighting against you, you should not fight them'. But, Raouf says, these students 'have no knowledge of all these things, they were in the mountains with only guns'.Since October, Raouf has trained 250 men in Kandahar. 'If we continue, I am sure they will change. I have seen a lot of changes already.'After class, the fighters say they will modify some behaviours. 'I will not enter hospitals with weapons any more,' says Barakatullah, 28. 'It was also new for me to hear that we have to respect the human dignity of prisoners.' During the course, Barakatullah had stood up to speak about the torture he'd endured at Bagram jail, where he spent eight years. But the young man, with his long black beard and soft eyes, seems more weary than angry. After losing all his family except his mother in a US airstrike, all he wishes for is 'a normal life'. 'If I can find another job, I would leave the police. I can be a shopkeeper or work for an NGO.' According to Ashley Jackson, co-director of the Centre for the Study of Armed Groups at the Overseas Development Institute, it is important to keep engaging with the Taliban. 'Even small changes to their behaviour could save lives,' she says. In the classroom, all students wear a turban or a small traditional hat. Some regularly raise their hands to answer. Others fidget with their prayer beads at the back, struggling to sit still. Fighters readily agree with preventing gender violence, but some topics call for more tact, like the use of improvised explosive devices (IED), suicide bombers or any act that may hurt civilians. Taliban soldiers, since their return to power, have often killed civilians because their vehicles didn't stop at checkpoints.'The Taliban have transitioned from a fighting force to a government almost overnight - with almost no preparation, training or understanding of things like human rights norms,' says Jackson. 'There are horrific problems with torture and beating in Taliban detention. And the Taliban isn't doing much to address that, so it's really up to others to try whatever they can to prevent more suffering.' Kefayatullah, 22, one of those on the course, now works in a jail. 'I learned yesterday that we should behave humanely with prisoners,' he says. 'When I went back to the prison where I work, a person called saying that the mother of a prisoner wanted to talk to her son. Before, we were not allowing this. But because of the training, I gave my mobile to the prisoner to speak to his mother.' About 60% of the students cannot read, some have only attended religious classes in rural madrasas. 'I'd like to restart my education and learn English. After class yesterday, I told my friends we should ask for a teacher to come to the police headquarters,' says Kefayatullah. During the break, the fighters stay seated, laugh and take pictures of each other. It is an image far removed from the one they often project in propaganda videos. According to Faryaneh Fadaei, Geneva Call's director for Afghanistan, the key to the training's success is to adapt the material to cultural sensitivities, with each rule linked to Islamic references 'Because it is contextualised, developed with community leaders and religious scholars, it is accepted,' says Fadaei. 'Usually after the training, the participants ask for more training and booklets to give to their friends.' Geneva Call trains between 200 and 400 people a month across Afghanistan, half of them members of armed forces. Maiwandi, 21, is in the Taliban's elite special forces. Seated at the back in his military jacket, he struggles to concentrate. Maiwandi joined the Taliban at 12. At 19, faced with brutal US raids in his village, he enrolled as a suicide bomber. 'This war took the best years of my life, my childhood and my education,' he says. 'Now when I see people who are educated, who went to university, I feel bad and wish I was them.' Like Barakatullah or Kefayatullah, Maiwandi represents the importance of Geneva Call's training for young Taliban members who have only known violence. After the course, Maiwandi says he would love to study more in future but adds that, if asked by his leadership, he would do what he'd signed up for, as a suicide bomber. Still, perhaps, he hopes 'there will be no more war'.

He was in the recovery ward two days later when he was woken up by the sounds of war. ' I thought it was a fire alarm,' he said. 'It was a double shock to learn what had happened from a nurse. Not only had Russia invaded my country, but I could barely move after my operation and we needed to get to the bomb shelter.' Serhiy was among 450 patients who were receiving treatment at the National Cancer Institute in Kyiv when Russia invaded on 24 February; 40 of them were children recovering after surgery, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplants. Life changed irrevocably for everyone in Ukraine that day, but the institute's oncologists knew they still had a job to do. They were soon having to operate not only as the leading centre in the country for patients in need of lifesaving cancer treatment, but a refuge from the Russian army's murderous path. For those like Serhiy who were unable to return to their own homes or cities - Mariupol, Kherson and towns near Kyiv were either under bombardment or occupation - the institute was the only place where they could stay.  Serhiy and his wife stayed at the Institute until 20 April before heading to western Ukraine to continue his cancer treatment. 'I'm not alone in this situation,' he said by phone . 'There are thousands of cancer patients from Mariupol and other cities now occupied by Russia who have been left homeless, without work, without money, and on top of all that, we still need to continue our treatment.' Founded in 1920, the National Cancer Institute is one of the oldest and most respected medical institutions in Ukraine. The exterior of its main buildings, which date back to the 1960s and 70s, is adorned by a huge Soviet-era mosaic.  Prior to the invasion, doctors here who had access to operating rooms unparalleled in Ukraine, annually treated more than 25,000 cancer patients and performed 8,000 surgeries.  'The first days of the invasion brought uncertainty and a sudden halt to the usual way we did things,' says Andriy Beznosenko, the institute's lead doctor and a colorectal cancers specialist. 'A quarter of our employees could not get to work or were caught up with moving their families to the west of Ukraine.' Several doctors were also conscripted or volunteered to go to fight on the frontlines. Makeshift beds quickly filled up the corridors located deep within the building to protect patients from missile strikes. With space running out, admitting new patients became difficult. By week two, says Beznosenko, doctors and patients had started to adapt. Where possible, children were evacuated to Poland and adult patients from the east were moved to medical facilities in the west of the country.  But more than two months into the war, 85% of staff have resumed work in Kyiv. Many have even moved into the Institute's premises themselves. 'It's actually been very convenient,' says Beznosenko. 'You practice medicine, hold online conferences with doctors from other countries, analyse the professional situation in oncology and, as a result, you're less distracted, nervous, or in a hurry.' Volunteers at the Institute also set up a 24/7 hotline that offers psychological help to cancer patients faced with the added trauma of dealing with serious medical issues during wartime. Only radiation therapy has not fully resumed operations. Countless Ukrainian cancer patients have, along with the 5 million people who have fled the country, ended up in Poland, Germany, the Baltic states and elsewhere seeking treatment. However many fled without first being able to obtain their medical records. Despite the circumstances, the institute has been able to supply digitised copies of records for many, and sometimes even provide consultations remotely. Beznosenko estimates that between 15% and 20% of Ukrainian cancer patients have had to discontinue their treatment as a result of the Russian invasion.  Medics from the Ukrainian diaspora worldwide, meanwhile, are organising for materials to be sent to the institute. More than 2,000 bottles of Keitrude, one of the most expensive cancer drugs in the world - a single dose costs more than $5,000 (PS4,000) to administer - was recently obtained free of charge via a donation. But the Kyiv clinicians say they are committed to more than diagnosing and treating cancer. They have been reaching out to the top US cancer centres asking them to take in and train Ukrainian oncologists who have fled the war, most of whom are women, since most men are not allowed to leave the country. The bureaucracy of the American medical and legal systems have made this a major challenge, but Beznosenko says they remain determined. His team is also documenting their experiences and the lessons they have learned about wartime cancer treatment for the future research benefit of the international medical community. 'We have an obligation to do so,' he says. 'Let it be that none of them ever need it, but it is better that they are at least aware of what we've managed to do. We didn't have access to the lessons learned by doctors in Syria or Afghanistan.'  The situation remains dire for cancer patients in eastern Ukraine. Two oncology centres, one in Kharkiv and one Mariupol, were completely destroyed by Russian missile strikes and had to cease operations, according to Beznosenko. Nor is the Russian army providing humanitarian corridors from occupied areas to cancer patients who need treatment, he said. Oncology units in Chernihiv, Sumy, and Mykolaiv have repeatedly been hit by missile strikes yet they are continuing to take in patients. Even in peacetime, oncologists engage in a daily fight with a ruthless and unpredictable disease. In this sense, these doctors were already battle-hardened. With help from the global medical community, they feel prepared for a long haul. Ukrainians, Beznosenko said, 'will remember the help we received during this terrible time for centuries to come'.", "76000d6b7e7f00a6020d9637890c7b2f5bea6bf1054fd80651e26d42": "In Ukraine's second city, where the barrage of Russian shelling has been among the most relentless endured, hundreds of people stand in line at a post office, waiting to be given chicken and potatoes. As elsewhere in the country, the mundane institutions of civil society in Kharkiv have had to be hastily repurposed for the goal of keeping its population alive, and about 30 such locations across the city have been turned into food aid distribution points.  Workers at this branch of postal company Nova Poshta, who are being paid by their employer to hand out food instead of post, say that an average of 3,000 people come to their repurposed branch every day, seven days a week. They manage the queues using the post office's ticket system. 'There's no work. The No 1 thing at the moment is humanitarian aid,' says Ihor Shapovalov, a construction worker who lost his job on 24 February and has just received a quarter of a chicken. 'We just want to thank the guys for everything they're doing.' Kharkiv has been one of the worst-hit cities still under Ukrainian control. Since the war began two months ago, civilians have died and been injured almost every day as a result of Russian shelling. On Saturday, one person died and five were injured as a result of mortar fire, according to the regional governor. The city is starting to show signs of life, but its economy is in tatters. Most shops and businesses remain closed. Another man waiting in the queue at the repurposed post office is 30-year-old Zhenia Myrhorod. He says he has tried to get work unloading humanitarian aid at a warehouse, but there is not enough work to go around. 'I even collected metal from the missiles but couldn't find anyone to buy it,' says Myrhorod. 'I'm 30 years old. I've got legs and arms, but nobody wants them.' The postal workers are helped by local volunteers, who were once queueing themselves and then offered to pitch in. They now have a rota. The volunteers say they are also out of work but, by doing this, they feel they at least get some exercise. A large chunk of Ukraine's workforce is unofficially employed, as many employers want to avoid tax and pension contributions. As such, they were not eligible for the $250 (PS200) compensation that the Ukrainian government distributed in March. Yuriy Ponomarenko, a 61-year-old volunteer who unloads the trucks and breaks the frozen chickens up, was a weightlifting trainer before the war. Most of his trainees have left or are fighting. 'This is what I was built for,' he says. As the Guardian interviews people in the queue, several say they are nervous about talking to the media in case it attracts an attack. Local police ask us not to identify the number of the postal branch. In late March, six people died and 15 were injured when a rocket hit a queue at another Nova Poshta. Meanwhile, about 1,000 young people in Kharkiv are distributing food door-to-door to those who are unable to leave their houses, says Oleksandr Getmantsev, who has been volunteering since the first weeks of the war. Alex and his group collect donations, mostly from Kharkivans who have fled and want to help those still in the city. Getmanstev and his friend Zoya Zakharova visit around five addresses a day of people who get in contact with them through word of mouth. Many of those they visit are pensioners who have money in their accounts but cannot walk to the few functioning post offices to retrieve it. Others, like his mother, live in northern Kharkiv, which is under constant bombardment. People in the worst affected areas on the edges of the city have nowhere to buy food and often no means to cook it because gas and electricity have been cut off. Many of them are living in basements and only come out to cook on makeshift barbecues outside. 'My mother doesn't want to leave her home. I'm not sure what it would take for her to leave - they are bombed constantly,' says Getmanstev with a laugh, adding that he visits her about once a week on his rounds. 'I guess she's got used to it.' At least two international organisations have recently started work in the city, but Getmanstev says it is difficult to evaluate the impact they are having on the ground as they have not been visible. The last time the Guardian visited Kharkiv in late March, the city's governor said that international organisations were sending large quantities of aid but were not on the ground. One woman, Viktoria Anatolivna, is 32 weeks pregnant with twins and alone with her six-year-old son, Danylo. She says they have only been outside four times since the war started because of the shelling. She wraps Danylo in duvets in the bathtub with the cat when the shelling starts, and takes the floor in their corridor for herself. 'I've run out of money and all my relatives have left,' she says. She relies on the volunteers, and some soldiers who also bring them food. Anatolivna gave birth to Danylo at the maternity hospital near their house but will have her twins in a hospital in the city centre. The maternity clinic nearest her is overseeing births in the basement because of the shelling, and it would be an extra risk with a twin birth. The last stop on the food donations route is Nadia Chaikovska, a 70-year-old woman who now takes care of more than 20 cats who were abandoned by fleeing neighbours. Alex and Zoya bring her sacks of cat food. 'I've already buried five that I've found lying around,' says Chaikovska. 'I just love animals. These cats are sterilised; some of them are pedigrees. They can't survive on their own.'", "4fb8d27c193ab9d2678be0d45f26ba83b4f931d9148cca1d183da321": "", "09c1fb0f4b719e06e8a9df67800f6896e534e900224df9e2ddb6cb79": "When a string of mysterious explosions hit government buildings in Transnistria, the Moscow-backed separatist region of Moldova, there was no immediate claim of responsibility. But for Pasha, a 24-year old journalist from the breakaway region's capital, Tiraspol, this week's blasts were a clear sign that it was time to get out. 'There was a chance that there would be more attacks, and it's no fun waiting to find out where would be hit next,' he said. Adding to the uncertainty were growing rumours that men in the region would be mobilised to fight alongside Russian troops across the border in Ukraine. So Pasha, his mother and his friend, fellow journalist Maxim, 23, packed their essentials and drove to the Moldovan capital, Chisinau, where they are staying with relatives. They are hoping to return home, but other friends who left Transnistria have already fled to Turkey, Poland or the Czech Republic. With a population of 470,000 people, Transnistria is a predominantly Russian-speaking sliver of land wedged between the Nistru River and the Ukraine border. A year after Moldova declared independence from the Soviet Union, the region broke away in 1992 after a five-month war in which Russian forces (and Crimean Cossacks) intervened on the side of the separatists. No country, not even Russia, has recognised the self-declared Transnistrian Moldovan Republic, but the 'frozen conflict' has kept Moldova partitioned ever since. Now, many fear that last week's explosions may herald a dangerous thaw. On Monday, government buildings in Tiraspol were hit by what appeared to be rocket-propelled grenades. In the following days, blasts hit a radio tower broadcasting in Russian, and shots were reportedly fired near a Russian arms depot. Separatist authorities in Tiraspol blamed the incidents on Ukrainian infiltrators. Kyiv has accused Russia of launching the attacks to further destabilise the region, while Moscow denounced them as 'acts of terror'. Meanwhile, Moldova's pro-EU president, Maia Sandu, blamed the blasts on infighting between rival factions in Transnistria. But the uncertainty has prompted growing concern that Moldova could be dragged into the Ukraine conflict. Moscow has long used Transnistria as a bargaining chip in its efforts to influence Moldova. The region still hosts 1,500 Russian troops, as well as 20,000 tonnes of ammunition stored in Cobasna, the largest ammunition depot in eastern Europe. Among last week's incidents were shootings a mile away from Cobasna, according to the Transnistrian authorities. Moldovan government sources fear that if the depot blew up it could result in an explosion 10 times bigger than the 2020 Beirut blast, where more than 2,000 tonnes of explosive material was stored. Despite its frail economy, Moldova has already received about 95,000 people fleeing the war in Ukraine, a figure equivalent to 3.5% of its population, according to the Moldovan foreign ministry. The events of the past week are prompting many refugees to consider fleeing once again. 'If war comes to Transnistria, I will leave, probably for Germany,' said Lyuda, 35, an accountant and single mother who fled Mariupol in March and is now working for the UNHCR mission in Moldova. Security has been stepped up on the Transnistrian side of the border, causing long queues of traffic, but at the Moldovan checkpoints down the road, security forces simply wave vehicles through. Moldova's government has pledged to step up security, but for now life goes on as usual in Chisinau. In Valea Morilor park, joggers make laps around the lake, anglers cast their lines and the loudest sound is the voice of a canoe coach training her students. Across the city, Chisinau's central market is packed with people buying food and offerings for the upcoming Pastele Blajinilor, Moldova's holiday commemorating the dead. But even here, there is an edge of uncertainty. Alex, a stallholder in the market had just come off a call with a cousin in Italy who he was thinking of joining, he said. 'I have a wife and a baby, and I don't feel safe here,' he said. Inside Transnistria, separatist authorities have kept quiet about the war raging in Ukraine. 'Transnistria's leaders are being cautious,' said the Moldovan journalist Alina Radu. 'They are not cheering on the war, but nor are they criticising Russia's military aggression.' Since the death of its Soviet-era industry, Transnistria's economy has been dominated by a small elite. Russia provides Transnistria with free gas, which gives businesses in the region a competitive advantage over Moldovan businesses. Its largest conglomerate, which controls everything from petrol stations to a cognac distillery - and the football club FC Sheriff - was co-founded by the former KGB agent Victor Gusan, who also has a Ukrainian passport and owns property in Kyiv. 'Transnistrian leaders are under a lot of pressure,' said the Moldovan journalist Alina Radu. 'For the first time, they are isolated. Both Moldova and Ukraine have governments that are not pro-Russian. Transnistrian elites have two options: to follow the orders of Putin, the most terrible dictator today, or to have a prosperous future with Europe.' Analysts in Chisinau warn that Russian security and propaganda networks are spreading. A recent report from the Royal United Services Institute, said Russian spy agency the FSB aimed 'to destabilise Moldova to tie down Ukrainian forces on the southern border, to counter growing pro-European sentiment in the country, and to show the west that support for Ukraine risks wider consequences, including in the Balkans'. Valeriu Pasa, from the Moldovan thinktank Watchdog said that Moscow had overestimated vestigial pro-Moscow sentiment in the country.  'Russia's aim is to create tension,' he said, pointing to debunked viral reports that Romanian troops had been deployed near the border with Moldova. But Moldova, with a population of just 2.5 million, has already suffered from mass emigration, and such pressures still had the potential to cause more harm, said Radu. 'I am afraid that the tension might generate yet another harmful wave of emigration - just as the government has been trying to bring back the diaspora.'", "8786e16f7813f5d06ffcf451dc6e54202e74039c294d30fc5b9bc3e1": "For the past few weeks, Nazeer Ahmed has been living in one of the hottest places on Earth. As a brutal heatwave has swept across India and Pakistan, his home in Turbat, in Pakistan's Balochistan region, has been suffering through weeks of temperatures that have repeatedly hit almost 50C (122F), unprecedented for this time of year. Locals have been driven into their homes, unable to work except during the cooler night hours, and are facing critical shortages of water and power. Ahmed fears that things are only about to get worse. It was here, in 2021, that the world's highest temperature for May was recorded, a staggering 54C. This year, he said, feels even hotter. 'Last week was insanely hot in Turbat. It did not feel like April,' he said. As the heatwave has exacerbated massive energy shortages across India and Pakistan, Turbat, a city of about 200,000 residents, now barely receives any electricity, with up to nine hours of load shedding every day, meaning that air conditioners and refrigerators cannot function. 'We are living in hell,' said Ahmed. It has been a similar story across the subcontinent, where the realities of climate change are being felt by more than 1.5 billion people as the scorching summer temperatures have arrived two months early and the relief of the monsoons are months away. North-west and central India experienced the hottest April in 122 years, while Jacobabad, a city in Pakistan's Sindh province, hit 49C on Saturday, one of the highest April temperatures ever recorded in the world. The heatwave has already had a devastating impact on crops, including wheat and various fruits and vegetables. In India, the yield from wheat crops has dropped by up to 50% in some of the areas worst hit by the extreme temperatures, worsening fears of global shortages following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has already had a devastating impact on supplies. In Balochistan's Mastung district, known for its apple and peach orchards, the harvests have been decimated. Haji Ghulam Sarwar Shahwani, a farmer, watched in anguish as his apple trees blossomed more than a month early, and then despair as the blossom sizzled and then died in the unseasonal dry heat, almost killing off his entire crop. Farmers in the area also spoke of a 'drastic' impact on their wheat crops, while the area has also recently been subjected to 18-hour power cuts. 'This is the first time the weather has wreaked such havoc on our crops in this area,' Shahwani said. 'We don't know what to do and there is no government help. The cultivation has decreased; now very few fruits grow. Farmers have lost billions because of this weather. We are suffering and we can't afford it.' Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's minister for climate, told the Guardian that the country was facing an 'existential crisis' as climate emergencies were being felt from the north to south of the country. Rehman warned that the heatwave was causing the glaciers in the north of the country to melt at an unprecedented rate, and that thousands were at risk of being caught in flood bursts. She also said that the sizzling temperatures were not only impacting crops but water supply as well. 'The water reservoirs dry up. Our big dams are at dead level right now, and sources of water are scarce,' she said. Rehman said the heatwave should be a wake-up call to the international community. 'Climate and weather events are here to stay and will in fact only accelerate in their scale and intensity if global leaders don't act now,' she said. Experts said the scorching heat being felt across the subcontinent was likely a taste of things to come as global heating continues to accelerate. Abhiyant Tiwari, an assistant professorand programme manager at the Gujarat Institute of Disaster Management, said 'the extreme, frequent, and long-lasting spells of heatwaves are no more a future risk. It is already here and is unavoidable.' The World Meteorological Organisation said in a statement that the temperatures in India and Pakistan were 'consistent with what we expect in a changing climate. Heatwaves are more frequent and more intense and starting earlier than in the past.' A heatwave is declared when the maximum temperature is over 40C and at least 4.5C above normal. Over the weekend in India, Bikaner was the hottest place in the country at 47.1C, according to the India Meteorological Department. However, in some parts of north-west India, images captured by satellites showed that surface land temperatures had exceeded 60C - unprecedented for this time of year when usual surface temperatures are between 45 and 55C. 'The hottest temperatures recorded are south-east and south-west of Ahmedabad, with maximum land-surface temperatures of around 65C,' the European Space Agency said on its website. The high temperatures have put massive pressure on power demand in both India and Pakistan, where people have had to endure hours of power cuts amid the crippling heat. On Friday, the peak power demand in India touched an all-time high of 207,111MW, according to the government. India is facing its worst electricity shortage in six decades. Power cuts lasting upwards of eight hours have been imposed in states including Jharkhand, Haryana, Bihar, Punjab and Maharashtra as domestic coal supplies have fallen to critical levels and the price of imported coal has soared. In a bid to speed up the transport of coal across the country, Indian Railways cancelled more than 600 passenger and postal train journeys to make way for transportation of coal to power plants.", "3773f36e5e4e0d707d2918275dc90bf29efb9143fade526eb4fe8353": "Last month, an Ohio court certified a class action lawsuit brought by lawyer Rob Bilott that would cover 7 million people - and at some point possibly everyone living in the United States - who have been exposed to certain hazardous 'forever chemicals' known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS. The chemicals have been linked to cancer, birth defects, kidney disease and a range of other human health problems. They are called 'forever chemicals' because they do not naturally break down, persisting indefinitely in the environment. Two types of PFAS - PFOA and PFOS - have been found to be so harmful that they are being phased out of use. In addition to US multi-national company 3M, the class action lawsuit names 10 other companies that produce PFAS, which are used to make cookware, food packaging, water-resistant fabrics, firefighting foam and other products. The Biden administration last year pledged to undertake a massive PFAS mitigation strategy at a cost of more than $10bn. The Guardian spoke to Bilott about his lawsuit. The remarks have been edited for length and clarity. You have spent 20-some years now focused on exposing the danger of a class of chemicals we call PFAS, using litigation to try to hold companies involved in spreading PFAS accountable, and pressuring regulators to step up and do more to protect the public. You've written a book, Exposure, been featured in the New York Times as 'The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare,' and your legal battle has been made into a Hollywood movie called Dark Waters, as well as a documentary. Why are you so passionate about this issue? This is a worldwide public health threat. It's very frustrating when you step back and you look at the science that has gotten even clearer over the years about how dangerous these chemicals are and how widespread their use is. The companies knew that if they put these chemicals out into the world they were going to get into our water, into our soil, into the wildlife, into us, yet they did it anyway. And now, after making billions of dollars for decades, those same companies are fighting any responsibility and trying to shift the cost of cleaning this mess up on to all of us. I'm trying to do what I can to make sure that not only is the health threat addressed but that the right people, the ones who actually caused the health problems, are held responsible - not all of us. Most people might associate your work with your battle against DuPont, a large manufacturer of PFAS chemicals used to make such things as Teflon coatings in cookware. But now you're taking on many more manufacturers. What do you hope to achieve with this case? We first uncovered the existence of these chemicals in litigation against DuPont, which had been purchasing a chemical called PFOA from its manufacturer, 3M, and using it to make Teflon. We slowly started to realize that we've got not just PFOA but this bigger group of PFAS chemicals now being found in the environment, and in blood. But we were told that all the science that had been done was only on PFOA and that nobody had done similar research yet on these other chemicals. The companies said it was up to the exposed people, it was their burden, to prove that these other PFAS chemicals were causing harm. So in 2018 we filed the class action. The goal is not to get money damages but to have a federal court require that a new scientific panel be set up that would have the ability to look at this mix of PFAS chemicals in our blood and confirm the extent to which they are in fact causing harm. We want the companies to fund independent scientists to do whatever science might be needed to confirm these harms. Last October President Biden announced a plan to 'prevent PFAS from being released into the air, drinking systems, and food supply... and expand cleanup efforts to remediate the impacts of these harmful pollutants.' That plan is expected to cost taxpayers billions of dollars. Biden has set aside $10bn just to deal with PFAS in drinking water. You recently sent a letter to the Biden administration addressing the plan, offering your assistance and support. But you also expressed a very firm opposition to taxpayers' money being used for cleanup of PFAS pollution. Are you frustrated not just with the manufacturers but also with the EPA? It is frustrating that we've had several different PFAS 'action plans' announced over the years dating back to 2009. Nothing happened with the first plan and then we had another plan announced in 2016. More promises were made and again nothing happened. And so we've got this new plan that has been announced. (But) we're still seeing debate about to what extent should these materials be regulated, should they be declared hazardous or not. What I came to understand after dealing with this for so many decades is that we have a real systemic problem with the way our regulatory system is set up, the way in which science is generated, the way in which papers are published, peer reviewed, how that all interacts with our legal system, who has the burden of proof, who is being told they have to prove whether a chemical is safe versus whether it is harmful. All that creates a perfect storm of inaction. The only way people have been able to get clean water, to get compensated for the damage, the cancers that have been caused, is to go into our court system and try to fight this out in court for years. It is almost as though there is this intentional system of roadblocks baked into the system. So it sounds great, telling the public that we're moving forward, we are going to actually start cleaning this stuff up, we're going to allocate billions and billions of dollars to do that. But the money should not be coming from us, the exposed people. The taxpayers should not have to fund cleaning this up. We shouldn't have the federal government essentially bail out these chemicals companies by allocating billions that the companies should be spending to clean this up. You have gained access to voluminous files of internal documents from the various companies you've sued over PFAS. Many of these documents show that the companies were aware decades ago that PFAS was harmful, and notably that it was spreading widely, accumulating in humans. Can you elaborate on that? It's very eye opening when you start digging into the internal files of what these companies knew, what information they had access to going back decades, that they simply didn't share with the rest of us. For example, one of the things we found in the internal files of the main manufacturer of the chemical PFOS, was that this company was well aware by the 1970s that PFOS was being found in the general US population's blood and was being found at fairly significant levels. In fact by the 1990s, 3M's own scientists had sat down to calculate what a 'safe' blood level would be for PFOS. At the time, they knew that the level of PFOS being found in the general US population's blood was around 30 parts per billion. And when this internal 3M scientist sat down to calculate a safe blood level, the number he calculated was 1.05 parts per billion. Some 30 times lower than the level that was actually being found. Why weren't the rest of us told that? Why weren't we warned? We only find out about that decades later. Documents like that make it clear the potential risk to human health was recognized decades ago. Yet here we are in the year 2022 still arguing about whether we should take steps to get rid of them - and who should be held responsible for all this. This is one of the reasons why I'm doing everything I can so people can see the facts for themselves and draw their own conclusions about who ought to be responsible for the threat that has been caused. This story is co-published with the New Lede, a journalism project of the Environmental Working Group.", "0fe4acca0d2949d5dd459c87d35c76358ff1dcc87f1b67fd5c6821c1": "Matt Davis is surveying his land while sipping a knock-off beer. His property would fit into the average Queensland farm more than 5,300 times and he can afford to relax - there are no fences to mend or animals to feed and his crops are impervious to the vagaries of the weather. Davis is an exotic mushroom grower, his pocket-sized farm in the equally diminutive town of Harrisville, south-west of Ipswich, a repurposed lawn bowls club. The former cafe owner started growing mushrooms at home for family and friends. 'I spent five or six years studying mushroom growing and learning everything I could from reading books, and watching YouTube and Facebook videos and just connecting with people and asking questions,' he says. 'When this unique property came up for sale, I thought it would be perfect for commercial growing.' A former second world war army barracks, the property once housed soldiers stationed at Archerfield airport before being redeployed as Harrisville District Bowls Club in the 1950s, quickly becoming the social heart of the small rural community. But with an ageing membership, the club folded in 2016, the once immaculately-trimmed green consumed by weeds and bindi patches. Sold and used for storage, it was back on the market in 2020, a serendipitous time for Davis, who jumped at the opportunity to progress his hobby into a business. Now, with Scenic Rim Mushrooms, he sells pink oysters and freckled chestnuts grown in temperature-controlled rooms to some of the region's top restaurants as well as visitors who cross the old bowling green to his 'farmgate' shop. 'Look, I think if you're passionate about something and if the business plan makes sense, then you should just go for it because we only get one life and you've got to have a crack, you know?' he says. Davis's operation is emblematic of a new generation of small-scale farmers being welcomed into semi-rural Queensland communities. These farming first-timers are happy to take advice while also seeking to do things differently, with diversified income streams and a greater focus on sustainability. Nick Holliday worked in a law firm, as a union organiser and as an air-conditioning technician before buying Belvedere Farm, north-west of Brisbane, in 2014. His intention initially was to live on the property and commute to his job. 'But once I started raising cattle and chickens, I became deeply interested in the idea of feeding people, as well as using livestock to building soil organic matter,' he says. In addition to their own eight hectares, Holliday and his wife, Brydie, now lease another 60, still well below the average farm size in Australia of 4,300 hectares. The couple practise agro-ecological farming, using temporary fencing and feeding troughs to rotate cattle around different pastures every day, followed by the chickens, to further aerate and naturally fertilise the soil. On their leased land, an old dairy farm, they're using pigs to clear lantana and regenerate the degraded soil. To ensure a regular income, the Hollidays operate Belvedere Farm via community-supported agriculture (CSA). Their subscribers buy into the farm's projected harvest for a set period, receiving monthly deliveries of pork, beef and pastured eggs. Davis, too, has incorporated a subscription model into his business plan, albeit for different reasons. With demand for his Lion's Mane mushrooms, appreciated for their medicinal as well as culinary benefits, greater than he's able to supply, his subscribers get first dibs. These loyal customers appreciate the operation's light environmental footprint, with power for the temperature-controlled rooms provided by solar panels, minimal water use and the mushrooms grown on sawdust, a byproduct of the milling industry. 'It's not just for our conscience - restaurants are really wanting products and producers that are sustainable these days,' Davis says. While both the hands-in-soil and the business end of farming can be a sharp and sometimes devastatingly cruel learning curve, both Davis and Holliday have been gratified by the support they've received. 'There's a really awesome movement of new farmers,' Holliday says. 'First generation farmers - young people who are undertaking these practices and there are some great mentors, particularly holistic management educators who have adapted methods to an Australian context. We've been very lucky to have the opportunity to learn off a lot of other really good farmers.' Davis says the local council, keen to attract tourism to the region, has also provided business development courses and mentorship programs. Jo Sheppard, CEO of Queensland Farmers' Federation, says many young farmers are 'enjoying the diversity modern farming can offer'. This includes 'the opportunity to create a sustainable farming enterprise through efficient production, strategic investment decisions and diversification into emerging areas such as agritourism and natural capital.' Kate Keating is the south-east Queensland co-ordinator for Young Farmers Connect, a national not-for-profit network that provides resources and peer support for young farmers. She says small-scale farming is on the increase and proving a boon for the communities they settle in as well as consumers. 'They're fostering strong relationships between grower and consumer and educating people on the true value of food and in doing so, bringing a sense of connection back to our local communities and cities,' she says. For Kate Creasey, of Olive View Estate, the career transition from event producer and vintage makeup artist to olive farmer necessitated a hasty education in horticulture. 'When we moved here, the trees were drought-affected and hadn't fruited for a couple of years. The previous owner had just sort of lost heart.' But with lots of advice and support, she and her father have managed to double the size of the trees and had two successful fruitings since buying the farm together 18 months ago, she says. 'The first season, there were heaps, but they were very small fruit. This year we have a smaller crop, but the fruit is absolutely massive, plumped up with all that extra rain and nutrition. We've actually had other growers message us to ask us how we got them so big.' Creasey's not putting all her eggs (or olives) in one basket though. Like a growing number of farmers, she's mitigating risk with agritourism, a sector projected by the Queensland Farmers' Federation to be worth a potential $4.5 billion by 2030. Like Davis, she has a 'farmgate stall', a quaint 1950 Morris bus, formerly used as a broadcast bus for the Melbourne Olympics, restored by her vintage-loving (and olive-loathing) father where she sells jars of olives, tapenades, oil and more. She's also using her events experience to host weddings and other celebrations in the picturesque olive grove and has renovated a cottage on the property to run as an Airbnb. One thing stopping more people embracing a life on the land is often the start-up capital required to purchase property. 'We've been very fortunate that I owned this land before the price of land around here accelerated out of the reach of a farmer,' Holliday says. However, QFF says it is increasingly seeing out-of-the-box solutions such as share farming or, as the Hollidays are doing, leasing more land. Demand for Belvedere's eggs is so great the couple are looking to expand their flock from 300 to 1,000 hens. But while the business is growing exponentially, their life goals remain modest. 'We have no aspirations to control huge tracts of land or buy a Maserati,' Holliday says. 'We just want to have good jobs and pay ourselves a decent white-collar salary, feed people and heal the country.'", "e60013985affd445ccdb82c535b448c44c2ba49c501dc78b6bc369d5": "I am not exactly sure where my fascination and love of trees came from, but I do remember from a very young age seeing fallen acorns under a huge oak tree and being told that this tree had produced all of these acorns and that each one, like the one I had picked up and was holding in my hand, could grow into an oak tree and be hundreds of years old. After spending a lifetime working with trees, they continue to amaze me with their ability to grow and adapt through decades, and in many cases centuries, of seasonal change. Recently we've discovered their mechanism for communicating with each other below ground, which has become known as the wood wide web. The web is most active and thrives in areas of unworked woodlands (1) and forests, such as ancient woods, where the soil has been left undisturbed for centuries. This has led to an extensive underground network, linking trees in a forest together, young and old, helping them flourish as one giant superorganism. They share nutrients and even warn each other of attacks from pests. From my childhood days, the majestic oak has remained one of my favourite trees. After the yew, they are the longest living of our native British trees, living up to and occasionally more than 1,000 years, supporting the highest associated biodiversity, hosting hundreds of species of moths, butterflies, other insects, birds and mammals, as well as ferns, fungi, lichens and mosses (2). The total is higher than that of any other tree species in Britain. With oaks there continues to be life after death. Ancient oaks are brilliant as deadwood habitat, providing a niche for some specialist invertebrates that are rare and endangered and can only live on ancient decaying oak. We have two native species: the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the English or pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). The leaf stalks on the pedunculate oak are very short, less than half a centimetre, whereas the leaf stalks of the sessile oak are 1cm-2cm long. This is the opposite with their fruits (acorns): stalks on the pedunculate oak may be as long as 10cm, while on the sessile oak they are about 2cm long. Because of their presence in the landscape and their longevity, oaks were often used as markers and boundary trees. In Addlestone, Surrey, a tree known as the Crouch oak (3) is thought to be part of the old Windsor Forest and Great Park's Surrey boundary; it has now become an isolated street tree on the outskirts of the town. The oldest living tree in what remains of the Great Park today is a pedunculate oak named King Offa's oak (4), after the eighth-century Mercian king, and is said to date back to AD 710. It has the largest girth - more than 11 metres (36ft) - of the ancient oaks in the park. Not surprisingly, the centuries have taken their toll on this magnificent tree. Two individual sections are propped and partly collapsed, and a third section lies on the ground. However, King Offa's oak still has lots of healthy parts that produce new growth every year. Wyndham's oak (5) in Dorset is also called the Silton Oak and the Judge's Oak and is thought to be between 700 and 800 years old. Now standing in the meadow with few other trees, again, it is thought to have been a boundary tree on the edge of the forest of Gillingham, once a royal hunting forest. Old trees often have interesting associated stories to tell, but mystery surrounds an outstanding old sycamore (or is it sycamores?) that greets you as you enter the car park to the National Trust property at Saltram. This very special tree (6) is a central feature in the car park and there doesn't seem to be any written evidence as to why it has grown this way. I have visited it many times and my thoughts are that is part of a hedgerow long ago removed and perhaps layered. None of the old maps make this obvious, but its exposed roots imply that it may once have been part of a hedge bank. Another reason for these trunks, all lined up but obviously joined as one, is that it might just have been a fallen tree that was left and layered (propagated) itself, producing multiple stems, which were then purposely left as a feature. Without more evidence we will probably never know. Two intriguing woods can be visited in southern England. The first is Wistman's Wood, one of three isolated ancient upland woodlands on Dartmoor in Devon. When I first walked into this magical and beautiful woodland many years ago, I was stopped in my tracks by the sight of the dwarf oaks, their gnarled and entwined branches twisting in all directions, and below them an understory of granite boulders (7) covered with moss and lichen. The changing dappled light produces shadows and patterns across the boulders, known locally as clitter, adding to the wood's spectral qualities. The branches are clothed in a soft, verdant covering of epiphytic mosses and hanging lichens. It truly is an amazing and mystical place. One legend tells of the wood being home to large black 'wisht hounds' that had blood-red eyes and huge yellow fangs and roamed the moors on dark and misty nights looking for unwary travellers, led by the devil, or the Old Crockern, an ancient spirit living on the moor on Crockern Tor. The second is the forest at Kingley Vale in West Sussex made up predominately of yew, but with ash, hawthorn, holly and oak. Sadly, many of the ash trees have been infected with ash dieback (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus) and most are unlikely to survive. It is the yew trees that fascinate visitors most, with their twisting branches, snaking out from the parent trunk, reaching down to the ground (8) and creating arches and alleyways, which you have to scramble through to reach cave- and cathedral-like spaces. The branches that reach the ground, layer themselves, producing new roots and regrowing as siblings around their parent, increasing the forest's spread. These are known as walking trees and I love the thought of young trees being able to slowly walk farther and farther from their parent, exploring and extending their range by continually rooting the lower outstretched limbs. This is something you will only see in a natural yew forest where the trees can develop without human intervention, unlike the equally amazing huge ancient yews of the churchyards with all their lower limbs removed to about head height and above for easy access. Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire is home to Europe's longest lime tree avenue (Tilia x europaea), planted in 1840. It is almost 2 miles (4km) long and has 1,296 common limes planted along what is also the longest double avenue of lime trees in Europe. The avenue was closed for a time during the second world war when it was used as open-air storage for munitions in hundreds of corrugated iron stores. The road between the limes was reopened in 1955. Surprisingly, the black bands that can still be clearly seen on each of the trunks along the avenue (9) were from bands of grease painted on them in 1906 when the trees were found to be under attack from insects. The grease bands were to prevent the female winter moths climbing up them and laying their eggs in the canopies. Similarly, white bands painted on street lime trees to help them be seen during the blackouts of the second world war can often still be seen today. Farther north at Dunoon in Argyll, Scotland, entering the Benmore Botanic Gardens you are welcomed by the Avenue of Giants, dramatic lines of giant redwoods (Sequoiadendron giganteum) (10). Twenty pairs were planted in 1863 (one was replaced in 1995) by the American owner of the Benmore estate, James Piers Patrick. These giants are now nearly 170 years old. They stand at more than 50m, the tallest reaching almost 57m, and have girths ranging from more than 5m to almost 7m. They are among the oldest and tallest redwoods in Europe. As you walk along its 350-metre length, you feel very small. The life of a tree can be extended by coppicing and pollarding, traditional, ancient methods of woodland management that take advantage of the natural process by which trees grow. And it is through these practices of continually cutting back species for a variety of uses that some of our oldest trees survive, as coppiced stools and pollards, prolonging them long beyond their normal lifespan. Coppicing and pollarding mainly differ in the height of cut. Coppice is cut back to almost ground level, while pollards are cut back to the main trunk of a tree, but at varying heights, usually about head height. This was done to prevent livestock grazing the new regrowth. Many of the ancient and veteran pollarded and coppiced trees in forests today have not been managed for wood production for many decades and are known as lapsed pollards (11) and coppice (12). These trees, although visually stunning, are difficult to manage, with branch attachments that become stressed due to their weight held above often decaying, hollow trunks. They are, however, home to many invertebrates that can only survive on the decaying wood they produce, and nesting birds and sheltering bats that make use of the hollows. Coppicing has had a resurgence in popularity as it is a sustainable management method of woodland and woodland materials. Coppiced woodland is a haven for a rich diversity of wildlife, including rarer mammals such as the dormouse, and is carpeted with wildflowers in the spring. With enlightened understanding of the importance of sustainability, coppicing has a lot to offer, and I for one hope it is a practice that will continue to grow in its popularity.

The Israel air force said on its website at the weekend that the controversial overflight sought by settler leaders would take place on Thursday. The decision puts an end to uncertainty over the display after an initial announcement was taken down amid criticism from Mossi Raz, a legislator in the leftwing Meretz party, which is part of the ruling coalition, who termed it 'a provocative show of force and superiority'. The decision comes as about 1,000 Hebron settlers, viewed as including some of the most militant Israelis in the West Bank, make plans to expand their heavily guarded enclaves in Hebron, a city of roughly 200,000 Palestinians. 'This is a kind of annexation of Hebron to the Israeli state,' said the Palestinian activist Issa Amro, the head of the Friends of Hebron organisation that opposes Israeli settlement in the flashpoint city. 'This is a provocation of our feelings.' Palestinians will be doing anything but celebrating Israeli independence. They view that as the Nakba (catastrophe) when about 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled in the war surrounding Israel's creation. 'Instead of apologising for the Nakba, they continue to show us more signs they want the Palestinians to leave their homes,' Amro said. Ori Givati, spokesperson for Breaking the Silence, a group of anti-occupation Israeli military veterans, also criticised the planned overflight, saying it would 'represent another step in the de facto annexation' of the occupied Palestinian territories. 'It is hard to ignore the irony of an Israeli independence flyover over the heads of a people to whom Israel has denied independence for 55 years,' Givati said. But as has often been the case with the hard-right prime minister Naftali Bennett's coalition, the views of the left were disregarded in favour of those of the settlers and their allies. The planes are slated to fly over the Cave of the Patriarchs, a site where Jewish tradition holds that biblical patriarchs and matriarchs are buried. The same site is holy to Muslims as the Ibrahimi mosque. Yigal Dilmoni, the CEO of the Yesha Council, the umbrella group for settlers in the West Bank, hailed the decision. 'There is symbolism that the flight of the air force on independence day, which symbolises the return of the nation of Israel to the land of Israel, passes over Hebron and the Cave of the Patriarchs. This is a symbolic matter of values and ideals.' Eliyahu Liebman, the mayor for Jewish settlers in Hebron and neighbouring Kiryat Arba, said a wrong was being righted. 'This says that we are gaining equality and being treated like any other citizen of the state of Israel in all matters including the flyover which will go over our houses and not just certain cities,' he said Liebman added that every year, local residents and officials had impressed upon authorities that being included in the overflight was 'very, very, very important' to them and that this year they finally got a positive response. The overflight route will also include the south Hebron hills, where settlers are known for their violence towards Palestinians and Israeli solidarity activists.About 1,000 Palestinian herders there face the possibility of intensified military restrictions and even possible eviction due to army plans to expand the use of a firing zone, according to their lawyer, Shlomo Lecker, who represents them at the supreme court. The Hebron settlers count anti-Arab extremists in their ranks, including the far-right opposition MP Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has advocated for the expulsion of Arab citizens of Israel deemed to be disloyal to the state. But in recent years there has been a process of mainstreaming the Hebron settlers. President Isaac Herzog visited the Cave of the Patriarchs in November, declaring that recognition of Jewish ties to the site 'must be beyond all controversy'.", "e02a396fdf72a14491f9b17a160d6e046c1b9f6b9b6110bac5f181b2": "Bill Gates has responded to allegations of an extramarital affair on the first anniversary of the joint announcement that he and Melinda French Gates were getting divorced. 'I certainly made mistakes and I take responsibility,' the Microsoft co-founder told Today on Tuesday morning when asked if he was ever unfaithful throughout his 27-year marriage to French Gates. 'The divorce is definitely a sad thing,' the 66-year-old billionaire and philanthropist said, adding, 'I have responsibility for causing a lot of pain to my family. It was a tough year. I feel good that all of us are moving forward now.' Gates added: 'Melinda and I are continuing to work together. It was sad and tragic, but now we're moving together.' Gates refused to disclose additional details about the affair, saying, 'I don't think delving into the particulars at this point is constructive, but yes, I caused pain and I feel terrible about that.' In an interview with CBS in March, French Gates explained that numerous factors led to the couple's high-profile divorce last May. 'There just came a point in time where there was enough there that I realized it just wasn't healthy,' she said. 'I couldn't trust what we had.' French Gates also revealed that she cried numerous times during her marriage, sometimes while lying on the floor. 'How can I get up? How am I going to move?' she would ask herself, she said. In response to French Gates's comments, Bill Gates said, 'This was a very tough thing. ... We had a lot of amazing things in our marriage. The kids, the foundation, the enjoyment we had. And so it's a very hard adjustment.' He continued: 'I know divorces are different, but it's just a complete change. We were partners, we kind of grew up together, and now that's different. We're not married.' French Gates described her current relationship with Bill Gates as 'friendly' but explained she is not friends with her former husband. 'Friends is a different word for me,' French Gates said. 'That might come over time. But for me there's still healing that needs to happen.' Gates has released a new book called How to Prevent the Next Pandemic in which he outlines steps the world should take to avoid another global outbreak.", "becbe41cbae2111846448e5f440f4b3e3e5cc5450c4f31f2956c2eae": "Fiji's high court has ruled that the US government can seize a superyacht believed to be owned by a Russian oligarch who faces sanctions from the US and the EU, which is docked in the Fijian port of Lautoka. Judge Deepthi Amaratunga granted the request from Fijian authorities to register and enforce US warrants to seize the Amadea, which has been docked in Lautoka since 13 April and which is believed to belong to Suleiman Kerimov, who is considered a close ally of Vladimir Putin. The vessel with a crew of at least 25 was fined by Fijian authorities for breaching immigration regulations when it entered Fiji in early April after an 18-day voyage from Mexico. The defence claimed the yacht is owned by Eduard Khudainatov, who is not facing sanctions. The defence lawyer Faizal Hanif, acting for the Amadea's registered owners Millemaria Investment Ltd, asked the court for a stay on the ruling, expressing fears that US authorities would sail the vessel out of Fiji. The judge indicated he would grant a stay order and insist the vessel remain in Fiji during the 30-day appeal period.

The prime minister also rebuffed the prospect of a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, saying the government wanted to encourage energy companies to invest to bring down costs. Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, Johnson said: 'I accept that those contributions from the taxpayer, because that's what it is - taxpayers' money - isn't going to be enough immediately to help cover everybody.' He added: 'There is more that we can do but the crucial thing is to make sure we deal with the prices over the medium and long term.' Johnson was asked what more a 77-year-old viewer, Elsie, could do to reduce spending and was told she was already cutting down to one meal a day and spending days on buses to keep warm. He said he 'didn't want her to have to cut back on anything' but could not articulate what further help would look like. 'Just to remind you that the 24-hour freedom bus pass was something that I introduced,' he added. Johnson said he was not prepared to put further taxes on oil and gas companies, a move that Labour has called for and that was hinted at by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, last week. 'If you put a windfall tax on the energy companies, what that means is that you discourage them from making the investments that we want to see that will, in the end, keep energy prices lower for everybody. This is going to be something we have to fix.' His comments came as BP announced $6.2bn (PS5bn) profits for the first three months of this year, figures that the TUC called 'obscene' at a time of soaring bills. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary, said: 'The oil and gas firms may be doing their job for the shareholders of their companies but the government is negligently failing to do its job for the people of this country.' Johnson was pressed on why the government had not increased benefits in line with inflation, admitting that inflation 'could get worse' and saying that would 'knock on to the cost of borrowing for everybody'. 'And I'm sorry to say this, but we have to be prudent in our approach,' he said. 'We have to help people like Elsie and the families you mentioned, in the short term with huge sums of taxpayers' cash, through the local councils or through the schemes we're doing ... but the best answer is to have a strong economy where we keep interest rates as strong as reasonable and we ensure we get people into high wage, high skills jobs.' In the interview, Johnson was pressed repeatedly on whether he had lied to the public over Downing Street parties. 'I do my best to represent faithfully and accurately what I believe and sometimes it's controversial and sometimes it offends people, but that's what I do,' he said. Pushed on whether he lied, Johnson said: 'If you're talking about the statements I made in the House of Commons, I was inadvertently, I was wrong and I've apologised for that.' Johnson said he had not been fined again. 'I'm sure that will not remain a secret.' He said he had 'no idea' whether he would be fined again. 'I will make sure that as soon as I'm able to say something on the conclusion of the investigation, that you have a lot more from me on this.' Johnson was speaking before an address to the Ukrainian parliament. He said he remained proud of the Homes for Ukraine scheme to allow people to host refugees in their homes in the UK, which has been hit with multiple reports of failings. 'Perhaps we could have done it faster,' he said. 'The results are starting to be really excellent.'", "bb43fef9dbb77a51d9be5eb578353ce85a40fdc5218c50a37d8b6f01": "Police in Canada have intercepted a drone which crossed the border from the United States carrying a shopping bag with nearly a dozen handguns - but only after the pilot crashed the device into a nearby tree. Officers in southern Ontario were called to a home near the town of Port Lambton, north-east of Detroit, after residents reported seeing a stranger maneuvering a commercial drone. 'Our neighbour had spotted someone in our yard in the middle of the night and he had a remote control,' Christine Ackwood told CTV News. 'He wasn't sure what was going on.' But the drone operator lost control of the drone and sent it careening into a tree before fleeing in a waiting vehicle. Police recovered the drone with bucket truck, and that a plastic shopping bag was attached with metal carabiners and electrical tape. Inside, officers discovered 11 handguns - most of which were weapons prohibited in Canada. One of the images shared by police appears to show the serial numbers of a black handgun had been sanded off. Officers suspect the drone travelled east from Michigan across the St Clair River, which marks the border between Canada and the United States. But police still do not know who was piloting the drone, and who the illicit delivery was intended for. Many handguns used to commit crimes in Canada are secreted into the country from the United States. In the past, smugglers have used transport trucks, passenger vehicles and aircraft to evade authorities. The use of a drone suggests groups could be trying out new strategies, but it is unclear if Friday's discovery is the first time a drone has been used. The Ontario provincial police service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "b69d2151ea7ddee10d403166a4b8d10f48a0dc1c654b55488ce60555": "Fire crews were battling on several fronts to keep the largest wildfire burning in the US from pushing into more populated areas as it fed on drought-parched landscape in northern New Mexico. Authorities were encouraged by a forecast for Tuesday of improving humidity and shifting winds. But the blaze was expected to keep growing, putting it on track to possibly be one of the largest and most destructive in state history. The fire burning about 10 miles away from Priscilla Crespin's home is the first blaze to have forced the 81-year-old to leave the small community where she has spent nearly all her life. Crespin left her home in Las Vegas because smoke from the fire was not good for her asthma, her children were growing concerned and other family members who live nearby were making plans to leave. When her daughter showed up to take her to Albuquerque on Monday, fire crews were cutting down trees, raking pine needles and spraying water on properties in the area near her home. She grabbed clothes, photos and essential documents. 'It's awful. It scares you,' Crespin said as she was being driven away. 'You don't know when it's going to get to the houses.' Even though no evacuations were ordered in the town of 13,000, the blaze that has charred 217 sq miles (562 sq km) in New Mexico's pine-covered mountainsides had prompted some residents to flee. It also led to an evacuation of the state's psychiatric hospital. Wildfires have become a year-round threat in the drought-stricken US west, moving faster and burning hotter than ever due to climate change, scientists and fire experts say. In the last five years, California has experienced the eight largest wildfires in state history, while Colorado saw a destructive blaze tear through suburban neighborhoods last December. The fire in north-eastern New Mexico ballooned in size on Sunday, prompting authorities to issue new evacuation orders for the town of Mora and other villages. Las Vegas is also home to New Mexico Highlands University and is one of the most populated stops along Interstate 25 before the Colorado state line. Crews got a bit of a break on Monday afternoon as the wind diminished and helicopters were able to make water drops in key locations. But flames running along the ridges above town could be seen from the discount store, an empty baseball field and other vantage points. The county jail, the state's psychiatric hospital and more than 200 students from the United World College evacuated and businesses that remained open were having a hard time finding workers as more people were forced from their homes. 'We're trying to house and feed people with skeleton crews. Hundreds of people have lost their homes. It's an extraordinary tragedy,' said Allan Affeldt, a hotelier. He said most of his staff were evacuated from their homes and he canceled guest reservations to accommodate firefighters and emergency crews. The 197 patients at the Behavioral Health Institute were being sent to other facilities, with some transported in secured units and others escorted by police. Officials have said the north-eastern New Mexico fire has damaged or destroyed 172 homes and at least 116 structures. It merged last week with another blaze that was sparked in early April when a prescribed fire set by land managers to reduce fire danger escaped containment. The cause of the other fire remains under investigation. Another New Mexico wildfire in the mountains near Los Alamos National Laboratory also prompted evacuations over the weekend and other communities were told to get ready to evacuate if conditions worsen. That blaze has reached the burn scars of wildfires that blackened the region a decade ago when New Mexico had one of its worst and most destructive seasons. A wildfire in 2000 forced the closure of the laboratory and left about 400 homeless. The community was threatened again in 2011 when another blaze caused by a downed power line blackened more of the surrounding forest. In the southern New Mexico community of Ruidoso, two people were killed in a wildfire that destroyed more than 200 homes in April. That mountain community saw similar destruction from a 2012 fire. New wildfires were reported over the weekend: three in Texas, two in New Mexico and one each in Oklahoma and Tennessee, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. More than 3,100 wildland firefighters and support personnel were fighting fires across the country, with about one-third of them trying to prevent the big blaze in New Mexico from spreading. More than 4,400 sq miles have burned across the US this year.", "406d2391ed9cd58e167c4780f565fab2a12f85006f1ff153ea408132": "On a dusty field on the east side of Mexico's sprawling capital, about 500 Ukrainian refugees are waiting in large tents under a searing sun for the United States government to tell them they can come. The camp has only been open a week and 50 to 100 people are arriving every day. Some have already been to the US border in Tijuana where they were told they would no longer be admitted. Others arrived at airports in Mexico City or Cancun, anywhere they could find a ticket from Europe. 'We are asking the US government to process faster,' said Anastasiya Polo, co-founder of United with Ukraine, a non-governmental organization, that collaborated with the Mexican government to establish the camp. She said that after a week's time none of the refugees there 'are even close to the end of the program'. The program, Uniting for Ukraine, was announced by the US government on 21 April. Four days later, Ukrainians showing up at the US-Mexico border were no longer exempted from a pandemic-related rule that has been used to quickly expel migrants without an opportunity to seek asylum for the past two years. Instead, they would have to apply from Europe or other countries such as Mexico. To qualify people must have been in Ukraine as of 11 February; have a sponsor, which could be family or an organization; meet vaccination and other public health requirements; and pass background checks. Polo said US government officials had told her it should take a week to process people, but it appeared like it was just beginning. Some of the first arrivals had received emails from the US government acknowledging they received their documents and the documents of their sponsors, but she had heard of no sponsors being approved yet. 'These people cannot stay in this camp, because it is temporary,' Polo said. More than 100 of the camp's residents are children. Nearly 5.5 million Ukrainians, mostly women and children, have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded its smaller neighbor on 24 February, according to the UN high commissioner for refugees. Giorgi Mikaberidze, 19, is among the waiting. He arrived in Tijuana 25 April and found the US border closed. He complained that the U.S. government had given so little notice, because many people like himself were already in transit. He went from being just yards from the United States to about 600 miles (966km) now. When the US government announced in late March that it would accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, hundreds entered Mexico daily as tourists in Mexico City or Cancun and flew to Tijuana to wait for a few days - eventually only a few hours - to be admitted to the US at a San Diego border crossing on humanitarian parole. A wait of two to four days was eventually shortened to a few hours as US border inspectors whisked Ukrainians in. That special treatment ended the day Mikaberidze arrived in Tijuana. 'We want to go to America because [we're] already here, some don't have even money to go back,' he said. Mikaberidze was visiting relatives in Georgia, south of Ukraine, when the Russian invasion occurred and was not able to return. His mother remains in their village near Kharkhiv in eastern Ukraine, afraid to leave her home because Russian troops indiscriminately shoot up cars traveling in the area, he said. 'She said it's a very dangerous situation,' said Mikaberidze, who traveled to Mexico alone. The Mexico City camp provides a safe place to wait. It was erected inside a large sports complex, so Ukrainians could be seen pushing strollers with children along sidewalks, playing soccer and volleyball, even swimming. However, the refugees have been warned that while they are free to leave the complex, no one is responsible for their safety. Iztapalapa, the capital's most populated borough, is also one of its most dangerous.", "08e55afc358018eb7f6e7d1196e5056a6ecac4776032c189575bfa52": "A late PS: P&O Ferries first passenger trip from Dover to Calais since cross-channel tourist services were suspended in March is underway. The Spirit of Britain departed the Port of Dover this afternoon, having arrived frrom Calais earlier as cross-Channel sailings restarted.

It is due to return from Calais back to Dover this evening, now that the boat has passed safety inspections. However, three other vessels cannot run on the service yet.

Time to wrap up... here are today's main stories: The Australian dollar had a strong day, after the Reserve Bank of Australia hiked rates by 0.25% - the first rate rise in 11 years. The central bank lifted its cash rate target from the record low 0.1% it had hovered at since November 2020, during the depths of the Covid pandemic. It was raised more than expected to 0.35%, and the RBA signalled more rises to come. RBA governor Philip Lowe said in a statement that: David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital, says: European markets all ended the day higher, as they shrugged off Monday's losses. Germany's DAX and France's CAC both gained around 0.7%, while Italy's FTSE MIB jumped 1.6%.  Yesterday's selloff was partly due to worries over the global economy, the prospect of a hike in US interest rates tomorrow, and jitters after a Citigroup trader accidentally caused a brief flash crash. In the City, BP has ended the day as the top riser on London's index of blue-chip shares. BP climbed 5.8% by the close to end the day at 414.25p, the highest since 14 February, despite calls for the firm to face a windfall tax to help strugging familes. City traders piled into BP shares after it beat underlying profit forecasts and pledged to return $2.5bn to shareholders through buybacks this quarter. Investors were not troubled by BP reporting a loss of $20.4bn, as the $25.5bn cost of exiting Russia and ditching its shareholding in Rosneft was largely priced in. UK energy suppliers who hiked their customers direct debit payments unfairly have been warned that they could be fined. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has revealed that household energy suppliers face a crackdown on direct debit payment demands, as customers grapple with record bills for gas and electricity. Kwarteng tweeted that some companies had been increasing direct debit payments 'beyond what is required', and that regulator Ofgem had launched a compliance review which could results in financial penalties. In March, consumer campaigner Martin Lewis told MPs that some companies had unfairly increased direct debits in a bid to improve their cash flow at the expense of their customers. The founder of moneysavingexpert.com said the move could breach energy companies' licence conditions. Mortgage giant Halifax has jumped the gun ahead of Thursday's UK interest rate decision. Halifax has apologised for sending emails in error to customers, wrongly telling them that the Bank of England base rate had changed today. Customers of Halifax and Lloyds Bank, which is in the same banking group, were affected by the blunder. The emails state 'we want to help you understand what this could mean for you', and go on to explain the differences between fixed and variable rate mortgages. They also highlight the support available if customers are struggling with their repayments. The base rate is currently 0.75% after three hikes in a row, and economsts widely expect another rise on Thursday to 1% as inflation remains inflation. A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said (via PA Media). US job vacancies have climbed to a fresh record high, as firms continue to struggle to hire workers. There were a record 11.5m job vacancies available at the end of March, the latest JOLTS report shows, the highest since the survey began in 2000. That's up from 11.3m at the end of February, showing that America's labor market remains unbalanced. Job openings increased in retail trade, with an extra 155,000 positions available, and in durable goods manufacturing (up 50,000, as factories try to hire staff to handle those rising orders).  Job openings decreased in transportation, warehousing, and utilities (-69,000); state and local government education (-43,000); and federal government (-20,000).  With so many vacancies on offer, the number of Americans quitting their jobs also hit a record high, at 4.5m. That may be a sign workers are moving to better-paid positions, as they look to protect themselves from the highest inflation in around 40 years. Back to manufacturing.... and US factories had a stronger March than expected. Orders for manufactured goods jumped by 2.2% during the month, twice as fast as forecast, up from a 0.1% rise in February (revised up from a 0.5% fall). Durable goods orders rose 1.1%, led by computers and electronic products, while non-durables were up 3.2%.  That suggests demand for goods held up at the end of the first quarter, even though US GDP shrank unexpectedly by 0.4%.", "8d43ee4b52ad4d5d3a54c25cefebf78ffdcff3550c4713ba94761955": "Canadian police have shot and killed a polar bear that wandered into a Quebec community hundreds of kilometres south of the species' normal territory, in an incident that experts warn could become more common as sea ice coverage becomes more unpredictable thanks to global heating. The Surete du Quebec, the provincial police service, warned residents this weekend that a polar bear had been spotted near the town of Madeleine-Centre - the first time the Arctic's apex predator had been spotted in the community. The bear is believed to have wandered in from sea ice north of the community, but would have needed to swim portions of the St Lawrence River to reach the northern tip of the Gaspe Peninsula. It was shot dead on Sunday morning - an outcome experts say was inevitable. 'The moment I heard about where this bear was, I thought, 'this is a dead bear,'' said Andrew Derocher, a professor of biology at the University of Alberta. 'I worried it was going to show up someplace where it shouldn't be, cause a problem, and it's going to get shot.' Officials dispatched drones and a helicopter to help locate the bear. 'We work with a lot of things, we work with moose, with deer, with black bears, with everything, but we never dealt with a polar bear,' Sylvain Marois, a district commander at Quebec's wildlife protection agency, told the Canadian Press. Derocher, who has spent the last few weeks tracking polar bears over sea ice in the Hudson Bay with his research team, said encounters like this were exceedingly rare and difficult to plan for. 'These bears have never been there before in modern history, so this is not something that I think wildlife agencies can be prepared for.' In recent years, sea ice levels across the Arctic have become increasingly erratic and unpredictable - a challenging reality for polar bears, which rely on the vast expanse of ice for their winter and spring feeding. 'We're seeing more bears spend more time on land - including places where they haven't been seen before,' said Geoff York, senior director at Polar Bears International. 'The deck is really being reshuffled for polar bears - they have less consistency and variability. Things that may have worked for them in the past aren't working for them today.' Bears spending more time on the land means the likelihood of encounters with communities only increase, said Derocher. 'I can't draw a straight line between climate change and events like this. But in general ... these events are occurring more and more often. And we predict that they're going to become more common.' But successfully capturing and relocating a bear can cost tens of thousands of dollars and requires the right equipment, which officials in Madeleine-Centre didn't have access to. While the shooting made headlines across the country, Derocher points out that Inuit and First Nations hunters harvest more than 500 polars bears each year. 'It's a sustainable harvest and we don't really bat an eye about that. It may sound a bit callous, but this is a bear that got into a place where it couldn't stay. There were too many risk issues.' Conservation officers could have waited hours for the necessary equipment - but the risk to the community was too great, said York. 'The last thing one of these conservation officers wanted to do is put down a bear,' he said. 'They're just trying to keep people safe, and ideally trying to keep wildlife safe when they can.", "e55acda3263749b27bfe6feb713600258966505243d203a50c847aaf": "The Catalan government is to introduce a law to protect historic businesses as soaring rents and the pandemic have forced many of the region's landmark shops and bars to close. Shopfronts and other details that are more than 100 years old are already protected but the pioneering legislation goes further, with shop owners in listed premises having to ask permission if they want to change its commercial activity. In short, if a patisserie closes it will ideally reopen as a patisserie. 'What we need to do is to protect the non-material heritage,' said Sonia Hernandez, the Catalan government's director general of cultural heritage. 'The existing law doesn't protect things that people now believe we need to protect. The facade and the interior of some buildings are protected already; now we want to protect the activity as well,.' The aim is partly to prevent a repeat of what happened to Colmado Quilez, a much-loved grocery store that had stood on La Rambla de Catalunya since 1908 and was forced to close in 2014 when faced with a 700% rent increase. The signage has been preserved but the window display of wine and conserves has been replaced with expensive suits, obliterating the shop's essential character. Some historic businesses struggle on, such as Casa Beethoven on La Rambla, which has sold music scores since 1883 and is now an outlier among the bars and souvenir shops that dominate the city's most famous street. It only survives because it has a low fixed rent. Further up La Rambla, the Musical Emporium, which sold sheet music and instruments for 114 years, is now a bureau de change, and Camiseria Xanco, a purveyor of shirts and underwear for 203 years, succumbed to the pandemic. Rent rises forced the closure of Herboristeria del Rei, which had been selling herbal remedies since 1818 and was appointed herbalist to the Spanish royal family in 1857. Others at risk in Barcelona city centre are Xarcuteria La Pineda and the glove and fan shop Guanteria Alonso, relics of the city's history in a sea of chain stores. Hernandez accepts that as things stand the government cannot stop landlords raising the rent, but believes a growing awareness that there is more to conservation than a handpainted sign may help to conserve what remains of Catalonia's commercial heritage.", "f8bc73ae78811176928bde10729d605bcd95fee30098b6034cbc3ff0": "", "7386e03c4af8e899b2b831e5f9244f2f8548c2c963cf9bcaff58333e": "", "ac387bc4b6b0452f23c606c8755d57512fcccdde1a16fdbb7bb89639": "", "761605452726df4b837ff437e5a8171c0fbe445733a1a64002eac047": "", "2e7392d4f7ebd0c4b1395c2159b4844fdbe61531048b693ba0137d9d": "", "c7167b944ba802e6e6f9c548f63633dd6640ccaa5a7e8f1e2e96401f": "", "f47d703856a087a6287fc3eb07edaa63d408be5e5397113c4d9df3d3": "", "20d5d4e5579578c78469adbecfe42439a1f9ada90118bc7b036f8a0b": "", "523529851ac6e4d358830cad8959f33f37566837f97f5c80acf23825": "", "625613090a8da356d614bd6d87a7d81c73bf991aef692155ef322248": "", "4a362622b16553955a18b916cb964e4d4b4d0336bc910b476b127fe2": "", "1a00c07320e7a64eb8a6ff4e5538578f0b960f8c4917bc379e481458": "", "12837c254f500ec2fe056aeb44c509565ef342eb6763ad836ebd6e27": "", "f2a388062ba549dd4f2aff4890c2d4f125e226356260b932a2de4a4e": "", "c63f1fe5ae4afdbd4f0dc8a8a6cca2879563a783f3b2f9cba804a839": "", "a3fe89e06d48b8d95ce7d3cc36503a8f9543d6aa3c86a1d371537640": "", "da476238f7803e9979adeed98b305e39ac1895b2b480f3b5b919a397": "A first group of civilians trapped for weeks inside Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks have reached the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia, as Russian forces fired rockets at the industrial plant where other civilians and fighters remain. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said more than 100 people, including some who were wounded, had left the plant on Tuesday. Hundreds more are trapped in underground bunkers and tunnels beneath the sprawling industrial site - the last stronghold of resistance to Russia's siege of the devastated southern port city - which Moscow's forces resumed shelling overnight. Meanwhile, footage published on Tuesday showed emergency services dousing a fire in a building in Odesa on Monday evening. Ukrainian officials say Russian rockets hit a residential building in the city. Ukrainian forces say they have inflicted losses of 24,200 personnel on Russian troops, while the UK Ministry of Defence says Russia's military is significantly weaker as a result of its invasion. In the months before its invasion Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow's rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long considered the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia's ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups - the smallest operational unit in Russia's army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops - were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and Belarus before the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had 169,000-190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk - some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces - before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia's invasion pits the Kremlin's large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land, and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine's south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin's often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine would never join Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia's recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (PS8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia's state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany's north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe's most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe's energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.", "226664f41c4ec75d45c5389b7d8f7d4b7aed551abb9d705d6ecd75bf": "", "0928288dab405bc4a257c1cb71e252f7975b854907d7a78c5e48aef5": "", "2000745918b4a30097029d63a8b7d759d8cb975444a4194162dd3f23": "In the 1997 general election Roy Jenkins compared Tony Blair to a man carrying a Ming vase across a slippery floor, tiptoeing gingerly towards a Labour victory. The same description fits Sinn Fein as it approaches Northern Ireland's assembly election on Thursday, cautiously edging towards a potentially momentous win. The prize is to emerge as the region's largest party and claim the post of first minister - a symbolic and psychological breakthrough for Irish nationalism given Northern Ireland was designed to have a permanent unionist majority. Sinn Fein's response to this giddy prospect has been to run an ultra-guarded, disciplined campaign that minimises gaffes, surprises or spontaneity - anything that might risk a slip. 'I've never seen Sinn Fein be so cautious here, they're really determined to not frighten the horses,' said Jon Tonge, a University of Liverpool politics professor and authority on Northern Ireland. 'Their last big controversy was two years ago. They used to have one every two months. They're taking it to new levels to not upset anyone.' The party that once acted as a mouthpiece for the IRA has played down its push for a united Ireland and focused on the cost of living, a healthcare crisis and other bread-and-butter issues. During Easter, republican commemorations leaders paid tribute to the movement's sacrifices and martyrs without naming the IRA. The tactic is one reason the overall election campaign has so far been a sedate affair, with few sparks or memorable moments. Pundits have branded it 'dull' and 'boring'. The low-key atmosphere has undermined attempts by some unionists to depict this as an existential battle over Northern Ireland's place in the UK. In a televised debate on Sunday night, Michelle O'Neill, the party's leader in Northern Ireland, stuck to familiar lines seemingly designed to soothe any concerns around her becoming first minister. 'There was nothing awful about Michelle O'Neill's performance, but there was nothing memorable about it either,' said the Belfast Telegraph. For Sinn Fein that would be a good result given O'Neill was put under pressure over a disclosure her party had sought political engagement with Saoradh, a republican party allegedly linked to the New IRA. 'No gang who is involved in criminality, armed action, should exist today,' she said. O'Neill's debate performance was another example of Sinn Fein's softly-softly approach, said Deirdre Heenan, a social policy professor at the University of Ulster. 'They feel the first minister post is within their grasp. For them what's important is not to make a gaffe, not to get embroiled in controversy.' That was why the party had given John Finucane, a high-profile lawyer and its MP for Belfast North, a prominent role in the campaign, said Heenan. 'I think that's a clever strategy. He's a middle-class, articulate professional with a cross-community background. He has been put out to attract non-aligned voters.' Mary Lou McDonald, the party's Dublin-based leader and another able media performer, has also been prominent. Opinion polls suggest Sinn Fein will be the biggest party but fall far short of a majority in the 90-seat Stormont assembly, which will be elected by proportional representation in 18 five-member constituencies. The most recent poll put Sinn Fein on 26%, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) on 20%, the centrist Alliance on 14% and smaller nationalist and unionist parties accounting for most of the rest. Sinn Fein hopes the prospect of O'Neill becoming first minister will animate its base and that disdain for the DUP will encourage Alliance and Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) voters to give transfers to Sinn Fein candidates. By avoiding traditional Irish republican tropes the party also hopes to encourage some unionists to abstain or at least not transfer votes to the DUP, which has been convulsed over Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol. If overall support levels are replicated in seats, power-sharing rules would make O'Neill eligible to be first minister and the DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, deputy first minister, posts of equal power at the head of an executive drawn from all major parties. Sinn Fein has been in the executive since the 1998 Good Friday agreement and held the deputy first minister post since 2007. In practical terms, nudging ahead of the DUP and nabbing the first minister post would not change the balance of power. Nor would it signal a surge in support for a united Ireland. Most voters favour remaining in the UK. But the symbolism would matter, said Tonge. 'It would be huge. The stakes are genuinely high.' Sinn Fein would not push for an immediate border poll - not least because it would almost certainly lose - but use its victory to foster momentum for a referendum further bolstered by the party's growing clout in the south, said Tonge. Donaldson has refused to say whether he would serve in an executive with O'Neill as first minister, fuelling expectations of weeks or months of post-election wrangling before a new executive is formed. In addition to the Northern Ireland protocol, which unionist parties want removed or diluted, there will be arguments over rules on mandatory power-sharing. The requirement helped clinch the Good Friday agreement but is blamed for locking parties into dysfunctional executives that squabble, collapse and neglect services, notably healthcare. Critics contend Stormont is no Ming vase, more a cracked pot.", "a42750101826f018d934d47ddfc3b9537e73bbb38ae95582067ba0e2": "US airlines are still experiencing staffing shortages as air travel rebounded after initial Covid-19 shutdowns in 2020 when many airline workers were encouraged to go on furlough, resign, or retire early. The phenomenon promises to disrupt travel for flyers even as Americans largely seek to return to many pre-pandemic habits, including air travel for work and tourism. At JetBlue, flight delays and cancellations have been attributed to staff shortages. Transport Workers United, which represents about 5,000 flight attendants at JetBlue, criticized the airline's blaming of flight attendants for not accepting enough assignments, causing delays and cancellations.  The union argued JetBlue had responded to staff shortages and operational problems by increasing disciplinary actions toward workers, including increasing the amount of critical coverage days workers must be available to work or else accrue disciplinary attendance points that could lead to termination. 'Historically, JetBlue has always run a skeleton staff of crew members in all their departments,' said a longtime flight attendant at JetBlue who requested to remain anonymous as they are not authorized to speak with the media. The flight attendant said problems related to Covid-19 such as canceled, rescheduled or delayed flights that prolong time on duty or away from home and difficulties with transportation and hotel lodging for flight attendants have made many workers reluctant to accept extra assignments. They also said many flight attendants experiencing delays or flight changes have waited several hours for JetBlue to get them a hotel room or transportation to a hotel in a layover city, cutting into their rest time. Some have given up and paid for a hotel or transportation out of pocket. 'You are kept hostage at times and are unable to get home. This is really hard for people that do have children or parents that they help take care of,' the flight attendant said. 'They're not thinking of us as humans. We're still human beings involved in all of this too. We want to see our company succeed and we all want to come to work, we want to do the best we can, we want the passengers to keep coming back, but I feel like the thought of us as actual human beings has been removed from the equation. We're just robots that are here to get the job done and I think that's the thing we're struggling with the most, that there is no respect for the workers any more.' Gary Peterson, vice-president of the air division at Transport Workers United, argued JetBlue and other carriers have been competing in a race to the bottom terms of how workers are treated, retaining enough workers, and maintaining airline jobs as career jobs. 'I think there's a systemic problem in the industry - everybody's trying to compete against the lowest carrier, instead of setting themselves up to be the premier carrier,' said Peterson. 'Sleeping in the hallway at the airport - that never used to happen in the industry, and now it's becoming the new norm.' At Spirit Airlines, staffing problems have contributed to four operation meltdowns since August 2021, an unheard-of frequency according to the Association of Flight Attendants - Communications Workers of America (AFA-CWA). Workers at Spirit Airlines have protested outside airports in Las Vegas, Orlando and Dallas in recent weeks over contract violations by the airlines, mass cancellations that have stranded flight attendants, and persistent staffing shortages. Don Reno Intreglia, a Spirit Airlines flight attendant based in Orlando, Florida, and AFA-CWA vice-president for Spirit Airlines, said the airline's cancellation team and a separate team that handles flight attendant scheduling will get out of sync or fall behind, causing a domino effect in operations and leaving flight attendants to deal with frustrated passengers with no information. The result, he said, had been flight attendants being stranded away from home with no hotel lodging, left for up to 30 hours with no answers or resolution. 'It's been horrible on the morale for the flight attendants, because you're sleeping on an airport floor, you've got pretty much nowhere to go. We had flight attendants who were getting kicked out of airports in the middle of the night,' said Intreglia. 'We want the traveling public to know that we're trying to pressure management into making serious changes, so that we are prepared for the summer travel.' Pilots have been experiencing similar difficulties. Pilots with Alaska Airlines are voting on a strike authorization as new union contract negotiations continue and the airline experiences a shortage of pilots. At Delta Air Lines, pilots represented by the Airline Pilots Association have been protesting over the past several weeks outside Delta hubs in Seattle, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Detroit, Los Angeles and Minneapolis, over excessive scheduling and fatigue. 'Our pilots are tired and fatigued,' said Captain Evan Baach. 'Our pilots are working record amounts of overtime, we're working longer days, we have shorter nights in between our duty periods. We want the company to match their words with action and make changes to the pilot schedules.' A spokesperson for Delta Air Lines said in an email, 'Pilot schedules remain in line with all requirements set by the FAA as well as those outlined in our pilot contract. All of our people, including our pilots, are working hard to restore our airline and deliver for our customers as we emerge from the pandemic. We are grateful for and proud of their efforts.'

The size of Manhattan, Tanbi teems with life. The mangroves provide an important habitat for many birds and fish, which nest, breed and spawn in the protective, nutrient-rich environment. Snow-white egrets stalk schools of needle-like fish nipping through the shallows as curlews and hornbills whirl overhead, and higher still, vultures turn in lazy circles. For the next six hours or so, while the tide remains low enough to work, Sambou will paddle along the forests on the riverbank, knocking hard, rock-like west African mangrove oysters (Crassostrea tulipa) from the exposed mangrove roots. It is tedious, physical work - and painful. Sambou has only thin gloves and socks for protection; her hands and feet are scarred from the razor-edged oyster shells. Once the tide rises and resubmerges the mangrove roots, the rest of the day is given over to preparing the raw oysters on land - first steaming them in large steel drums, then removing the green-grey meat, which is flicked into wicker baskets. At the end of the day, the baskets of prepared oysters are taken to the roadsides and markets of Banjul, the country's capital, where they can be exposed in the heat for hours or days, and must be sold before the hard work of gathering them is wasted. For consumers, this labour is the hidden background to a tasty treat used in a variety of traditional west African dishes, such as oyster stew and oysters in lime. But for harvesters such as Sambou, making a sustainable living has been a matter of balancing environmental and financial responsibilities. Unlike other fishing in the Gambia, the oyster trade is entirely run by women, who pick, process, cook and sell them. Like most Gambian harvesters, Sambou, 33, is from the Jola people, an ethnic group known across Senegal and the Gambia for their hardworking agricultural roots. Along with about 500 other women in the Tanbi area, she is a member of the TRY Oyster Women's Association, a collective founded by a social worker, Fatou Janha Mboob, in 2007. A community-based, non-profit organisation, TRY aims to improve harvesters' lives through environmental and social initiatives, and training in financial management, food hygiene and water safety. Mboob wanted to make the harvesters a cohesive part of the ecosystem, rather than a force acting against it. In 2012, she successfully lobbied the Gambian government to make Tanbi a 'special management area', within which TRY members have exclusive harvesting rights. Before the TRY, the harvesters worked Tanbi's mangroves very differently, hacking off roots entirely and picking even small, unsaleable oysters. Through educational initiatives organised by Mboob and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), TRY members were encouraged to consider themselves stewards of the mangroves; roots are now left intact, and harvesters prevent others from chopping them for firewood. TRY is also involved in reforestation; as part of a UNDP-funded project, members planted more than 50,000 mangrove seedlings. In 2011, they voted in favour of a closed harvesting season, from March to June, and to set a minimum size for collecting oysters. To increase the oysters' market value, TRY members agreed to charge a standard 50 dalasis (75p) for a cup, a fivefold increase over previous average prices, which were decided by each woman. On a good day, Sambou might harvest, steam and shell enough oysters to make 2,000 dalasis (PS30). But on other days the low tide is at night, or too late in the afternoon to make it worth going on the river. And with the TRY harvesters' season lasting only four months, money remains their primary concern. Most supplement their earnings with subsistence farming.  During the off-season, Sambou travels south to the Senegal's Casamance region to buy cockles and oysters to sell in Banjul. To address this unregulated harvesting, TRY is working to expand its reach to the Allahein River, which forms the Gambia's southern border. Climate change also affects the work; floods are increasingly common and can cause sewage to leak into the mangroves, spoiling the filter-feeding oysters. Though TRY has achieved progress ecologically, for Sambou and Mboob the focus now is to raise the harvesters' standard of living by improving facilities. Mboob envisions a designated market area for shellfishers within Banjul, so harvesters do not have to sell at the roadside and their wares can be kept in saleable condition. 'Unless we have a processing area, we cannot sell oysters properly,' she says. 'We want to vacuum pack the oysters and sell them in the supermarkets, in hotels and in local restaurants. You cannot take the oysters being sold at the roadside and take them to the supermarket.' Sambou would like refrigeration, allowing the women to store their catch and avoiding the need to take oysters straight to market, thereby spreading their income over the year. But many women live without electricity, and establishing that infrastructure on the banks of Lamin Bolong, a tributary of the Gambia River, would be complicated and costly. Those goals might be distant, but the pair's work has not gone unnoticed. In 2012, Mboob received the 2012 Equator prize from the UNDP Equator Initiative. And in 2019, Sambou's leadership among the harvesters was recognised with a Young Business Innovation of the Year award from the Global Youth Innovation Network Gambia. Such recognition is overdue, says Mboob. 'We want people to know that the harvesters matter. They're the ones who protect the environment, who protect Tanbi and the mangroves. The harvesters take care of each other. Because of that, and because of their hard work, they are empowered.'", "548c276e52510b97db21d2b36e39e13386cd8077ff00a9d85149bbd7": "We would like to hear from people who are affected by the war in Ukraine.

In what appeared to be a stunning and unprecedented leak, Politico said on Monday evening it had obtained an initial majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito and circulated in the court on 10 February. The opinion strikes down Roe v Wade, the court's 1973 ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion, and a subsequent 1992 decision - Planned Parenthood v Casey - that largely upheld that right. Politico quoted Alito as saying: 'Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.' The justice adds: 'We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. It is time to heed the constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.' Four of the other Republican-appointed justices - Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - voted with Alito in the conference held among the justices, the article added. After an initial vote among the justices following the oral argument, one is assigned the majority opinion and writes a draft. It is then circulated among the justices. At times, in between the initial vote and the ruling being released, the vote alignment can change. A ruling is only final when it is published by the court. But if, as expected, it is adopted, the decision would rule in favour of Mississippi in a highly consequential case about that state's attempt to ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. That would sound the death knell for the half-century guarantee of nationwide protection of reproductive rights and allow each state to decide whether to restrict or ban abortion. Several Republican-led states have already passed highly restrictive abortion laws in anticipation of such a ruling by the supreme court which, thanks to three appointments by Donald Trump, now has a 6-3 conservative majority. Politico said it received a copy of the draft opinion from a person familiar with the court's proceedings in the Mississippi case. The draft opinion runs to 98 pages, including a 31-page appendix of historical state abortion laws, and includes 118 footnotes. The supreme court declined to confirm what would be the worst security breach in its history - regarding one of its most consequential rulings in decades that is sure to enflame America's deep political divisions. After the Politico story broke, footage posted to social media showed a crowd of protesters gathering outside the supreme court late on Monday night, waving signs and chanting 'my body, my choice.' Neal Katyal, a former US acting solicitor general who has argued many cases before the supreme court, tweeted: 'I've quickly scanned the draft opinion and it appears legitimate. This means there was a preliminary vote to fully overrule Roe v Wade and that a majority of the court agreed.' He added: 'There are lots of signals the opinion is legit. The length and depth of analysis, would be very hard to fake. It says it is written by Alito and definitely sounds like him. It's 60+ pages long. If this is a deep fake, it would require a state actor or someone like that. I can't imagine that. 'It's possible the Court could pull back from this position, but this looks like they voted that way after the oral argument.' Democrats condemned the leaked ruling. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, issued a statement saying overturning Roe v Wade would be 'an abomination, one of the worst and most damaging decisions in modern history'. 'If the report is accurate, the Supreme Court is poised to inflict the greatest restriction of rights in the past 50 years - not just on women but on all Americans,' they said. 'Every Republican senator who supported Senator McConnell and voted for Trump justices pretending that this day would never come will now have to explain themselves to the American people.' Christie Roberts, Democratic senatorial campaign executive director, said: 'If this report is true, this Republican attack on abortion access, birth control and women's health care has dramatically escalated the stakes of the 2022 election. 'At this critical moment, we must protect and expand Democrats' Senate majority with the power to confirm or reject supreme court justices.' 'I am horrified by the apparent draft supreme court opinion leaked this evening ... this should not be the supreme court's final opinion when it comes to abortion rights,' said New York's Governor Kathy Hochul in a statement. The governor later added on Twitter: 'I refuse to let my new granddaughter have to fight for the rights that generations have fought for & won, rights that she should be guaranteed.' 'This decision is a direct assault on the dignity, rights, & lives of women, not to mention decades of settled law,' said the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. 'It will kill and subjugate women even as a vast majority of Americans think abortion should be legal. What an utter disgrace.' Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted the the news showed 'Congress must pass legislation that codifies Roe v Wade as the law of the land in this country NOW'. Reproductive rights and civil rights advocates also weighed in. Naral Pro-Choice America's president, Mini Timmaraju, called it 'the most ominous and alarming sign yet that our nation's highest court is poised to overturn Roe v Wade'. 'If the supreme court does indeed issue a majority opinion along the lines of the leaked draft authored by Justice Alito, the shift in the tectonic plates of abortion rights will be as significant as any opinion the court has ever issued,' the ACLU said in a statement. Republicans, however, were exultant. Madison Cawthorn, a congressman from North Carolina, wrote on Twitter: 'Because of Donald J Trump, Roe v Wade will be overturned.' The Republican senator Tom Cotton condemned the apparent leak but applauded the vote, saying: 'The Supreme Court & the DOJ must get to the bottom of this leak immediately using every investigative tool necessary. In the meantime, Roe was egregiously wrong from the beginning & I pray the Court follows the Constitution & allows the states to once again protect unborn life.' Polling has shown that relatively few Americans want to see Roe overturned. In 2020, AP VoteCast found that 69% of voters in the presidential election said the supreme court should leave the Roe v Wade decision as is; just 29% said the court should overturn the decision. Alito said the court can't predict how the public might react and shouldn't try. 'We cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public's reaction to our work,' Alito wrote in the draft opinion, according to Politico.

Attempts to increase economic pressure on Russia come amid hopes of more evacuations from the besieged city of Mariupol, while the US warned that Moscow was preparing to formally annex the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the country's east. 'The reports state that Russia plans to engineer referenda upon joining sometime in mid-May,' said Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe on Monday. He said that Russia was considering a similar plan in a third region, Kherson, where Moscow has recently solidified control and imposed use of its ruble currency. The European Commission is expected to propose a sixth package of EU sanctions this week against Russia over its 24 February invasion of Ukraine, including a possible embargo on buying Russian oil. Kyiv says Russia's energy exports to Europe, so far largely exempt from international sanctions, are funding the Kremlin war effort with millions of euros every day. 'This package should include clear steps to block Russia's revenues from energy resources,' Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address on Monday. Germany said on Monday it was prepared to back an immediate EU embargo on Russian oil. 'We have managed to reach a situation where Germany is able to bear an oil embargo,' German economy minister Robert Habeck said. Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has been more cautious than other Western leaders in backing Ukraine, has been under growing pressure to take a firmer line. Scholz vowed sanctions will not be lifted until Russian president Vladimir Putin signs a peace deal with Ukraine that Kyiv can support, he said in an interview with ZDF public television. Weaning Europe off Russian oil is likely to be easier than reducing dependence on Russian natural gas. Moscow has demanded European customers pay for gas in roubles, which the EU rejects. Last week, Moscow cut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria. EU ministers meeting on Monday warned that complying in full with Moscow's demand for gas payments in roubles would breach existing EU sanctions. Ambassadors from EU countries will discuss the proposed oil sanctions when they meet on Wednesday. The moves came as Zelenskiy said the Mariupol evacuation effort was continuing and he expected more movement of people through humanitarian corridors on Tuesday from Berdyansk, Tokmak and Vasylivka. Mariupol's city council said evacuations would restart at 7am local time (0400 GMT) on Tuesday. Hundreds remain trapped in underground bunkers and tunnels beneath the sprawling Azovstal industrial site - the last stronghold of resistance to Russia's siege of the devastated southern port city - which Moscow's forces resumed shelling overnight. 'The situation has become a sign of a real humanitarian catastrophe,' Ukraine's deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, with supplies of water, food and medicine fast running out.   Some evacuees were initially taken to a village held by Moscow-backed separatists, but later allowed to continue to Ukrainian-held territory if they wanted. However, while the head of the Donetsk military administration said more evacuations under a UN/Red Cross plan were set to begin on Monday morning, by late afternoon the buses had not reached the agreed pickup point. Speaking earlier from the Russian-controlled town of Bezimenne, evacuee Natalia Usmanova, 37, said after leaving the steelworks that she became hysterical whenever the bunker started to shake. 'I was so worried it would cave in - I had terrible fear,' she told Reuters, recalling widespread terror and a lack of oxygen underground. Mariupol, which is almost entirely held by Russian forces, is a key target because its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, open up a land corridor to Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops for what has become the main focus of the invasion: achieving full control of the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine said on Monday it had formally closed the Black and Azov seaports of Kherson, Mariupol, Berdiansk and Skadovsk, all of which have been captured by Russian forces. The World Food Programme said about 4.5m tonnes of grain was stuck in Ukrainian ports.

It has issued this statement from Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow work and pensions secretary. That's it from us for today. For the latest live news, follow our Ukraine war live blog: Boris Johnson is now being interviewed on BBC Radio Solent. Q: Will you help councils down here? I was told by a councillor recently they cannot look for money down the back of the sofa, because they have sold the sofa. Johnson says that Conservative councils provide better value for money. Q: Conservative councillors are worried they will lose their seats because of what is happening nationally. Johnson says voters should think of the hard work put in by Conservative councillors.  Q: But people are mad on the doorsteps. Councillors say, when they knock on doors, people are talking about what is happening nationally. Johnson says the government is delivering 'a relentless focus on ensuring that we come strongly through the pandemic'. The Daily Mail has been aggressively running stories about the Tory attempts to bounce the police into reopening an investigation into claims that Keir Starmer drinking beer with Labour staff while campaigning in Durham in April last year amounted to a breach of lockdown rules. The police have already decided that it didn't, but the Tories are keen to imply some sort of equivalence with Partygate, and the Mail has been pushing this agenda too. After several days splashing on the story, the paper has today found another lead news item, but the story still gets a splash on the cover. Robert Hayward, a Conservative peer and elections expert, told the paper that the story could have an impact. He said: But new polling from YouGov today suggests the coverage of this story has not had a significant impact on public opinion. In January only 28% of people said they thought Starmer generally did not follow lockdown rules, while almost three-quarters of people said Boris Johnson generally did not follow the rules.  YouGov has repeated the polling, and the proportion of people saying Starmer generally did not obey the rules has not changed: it is still 28%. Johnson's numbers have improved, but only marginally. Now 70% of people say he generally did not follow the rules, down from 73% in January. Robert Peston, ITV's political editor, has written an interesting blog about Boris Johnson's claims in his Good Morning Britain interview this morning about the risk of benefit increases pushing up inflation. (See 10.26am.) Peston says it is unlikely that, if the government were to increase benefits, that would push the country into an 'inflationary spiral'. And if the government does favour an incomes policy, it should apply to private sector wages, which are pushing up inflation, Peston argues.  He goes on: Boris Johnson is now being interviewed by BBC Radio Wiltshire. Graham Rogers is presenting. Q: People are having problems with the cost of living. Why should they trust you to deal with it? Johnson says Conservative councils deliver better value for money. Q: But you have cut funding to our local councils during your time as PM. That is all the more reason to have councils that spend money wisely, Johnson says. He says he knows it is tough for people. The government needs to help people in the short term. It has done that, with PS150 off council tax and PS200 off bills. Q: That has to be paid back (the PS200). Yes, says Johnson. But he says the money is helpful anyway. He claims the economy is 'absolutely bursting with high-wage, high-skill jobs'. That is different from the past, he claims. Q: We have long waiting times in Wiltshire for ambulances. What will you do about it? Johnson says the government is investing in the NHS. He says hospitals not being able to discharge patients is a problem. Q: That is because of lack of care beds. What are you doing about that? Johnson says he is glad Rogers asked. The government has a plan for care. People won't face catastrophic bills for care. This is a government that delivers big things, he says. Q: Why do you want to carry on as PM? 'Because I have a massive mandate to deliver,' says Johnson. He says if he can get on with his agenda, in investing in infrastructure, skills and technology, that will deliver growth and prosperity for people, he says. He says he wants to level up. If he can do that, 'we will have the most prosperous economy in Europe', he claims. (As a quick glance at the statistics will show, to achieve that within the next half century - let alone within the lifetime of the government - would take nothing short of a miracle.) Q: You want to level up. But the money coming to the Manchester area won't compensate for what was cut during austerity? Johnson says he does not accept this. He rattles off some investment decisions affecting Manchester. He claims four new hospitals are being built in the north-west. And more diagnostic centres are being built. Q: HS2 is being cut back. Johnson does not accept that. Journey times from London to Manchester are being cut. Levelling up is about unleashing the potential of the whole country, he says. If it were levelled up like other countries, like France or Germany, which are more balanced, the economy would be stronger, he implies. And that's it. Boris Johnson is being interviewed now on BBC Radio Manchester. Stacey Copeland is presenting. She asks Johnson if his behaviour is going to cost the Tories votes. Johnson says he hopes people will vote on the issues that matter to people. Q: Are you doing enough to help people with the cost of living? Johnson says Tory councils deliver better value for money than Labour ones. On bills, he says the government is helping people with PS150 off their council tax, and the rebate (a repayable loan) on bills. Q: Will you allow the clean air zone in Manchester? Johnson says this is for local people to decide. In London they had a similar proposal. But it was badly thought out, and coming in too fast. Q: What decisions will the government take to help people? Johnson says the current plan is not the right one. The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, should deal with it, he says. A Conservative police and crime commissioner who pledged to crack down on speeding has been caught breaking a 30mph limit five times within a 12-week period, PA Media reports. PA says: Imran Ahmad Khan, who was expelled from the Conservative party after being convicted of child sexual assault, has finally resigned as an MP - almost three weeks after he first announced that he would quit parliament. The announcement came from the Treasury, which announced that he had been appointed be steward and bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern. This procedure is used because MPs theoretically cannot resign, and so the only way they can cease being an MP is by accepting a so-called 'office of profit' under the crown. The Chiltern Hundreds is one; the other is the Manor of Northstead. These offices do not involve any profit (there is no pay), and there are no duties at all of any kind - which is why someone convicted of child sexual assault can qualify. But Khan will have profited from delaying his resignation by more than a fortnight, enabling him to collect a salary until the end of April. He said when he first announced his resignation that he would appeal against his conviction, but that was because this would take months he would quit parliament, so that his constituents could get proper representation in the meantime. Under Keir Starmer, the Labour party has removed the whip from Jeremy Corbyn and, because the Ukraine war has drawn attention to Corbyn's opposition to Nato, it seems increasingly unlikely that the whip will be restored in time for Corbyn to stand for the party as a candidate at the next election. According to an article by Henry Zeffman in the Times today, some of Starmer's supporters think that the Labour leader should go further, and purge Corbyn's leftwing allies in the parties. Zeffman reports: Zeffman also quotes one source claiming Starmer 'intellectually accepts' the case for expelling prominent supporters of Stop the War, but other sources told him Starmer was reluctant to pick a fight with the left at the moment. In an interview with Times Radio this morning, when asked about this story, Starmer certainly did not rule out further action against the left. Instead of dismissing the story, he stressed (not for the first time) that he has been 'very clear' about Labour's 'unshakeable support for Nato'. He said he had been firm to MPs about that. He also said that he objected in particular to the 'false equivalence' between Russian aggression and the conduct of Nato (Starmer's characterisation of Stop the War's thinking). When asked again if he was prepared to act against anti-Nato MPs, Starmer said yes - but also hinted that voters might see that as a distraction. He replied: Momentum, the group set up to promote Corbyn and his agenda when Corbyn was leader, says a purge of leftwingers would mark 'the end of the Labour party as we know it'.  The Foreign Office has released more details of the armoured vehicles being supplied by the UK to Ukraine to protect officials. Boris Johnson mentioned them in his speech to the Ukrainian parliament. The Foreign Office says: The Guardian's Politics Weekly is hosting a live event tonight. My colleague John Harris, the podcast's presenter, is joined by Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, our colleague Gaby Hinsliff, and Gavin Barwell, chief of staff to Theresa May when she was PM, for a livestreamed event discussing Partygate, the upcoming local elections, the cost of living crisis and more. It starts at 8pm (BST) and you can book tickets here. Here is the full text of Boris Johnson's virtual address to the Ukrainian parliament.  At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the PM's spokesperson was asked if Boris Johnson knew who Lorraine Kelly was. (See 9.21am.) The spokesperson said Johnson 'wasn't fully across the ITV daytime line-up this morning' (implying that Johnson might still know who Kelly is, but just did not realise she was on at 9am, immediately after his interview). The spokesperson went on: 'As you'll appreciate, he has a number of issues to deal with.'", "038f0d9c4e65f66426822ccfacbdb10d823acbd1277cb282f18a9437": "", "605401bbf71e67edc833b6a688061dc13003ff5aa41e92cb896689ff": "The family of an American mathematician murdered at a Sydney gay beat in 1988 has thanked the judge for a 'fair' sentencing, after his killer was ordered to serve a minimum of eight years and three months behind bars. Justice Helen Wilson on Tuesday found that in a hostile act Scott White had punched Scott Johnson at North Head in Manly, causing Johnson to fall to his death. Wilson found there was not enough evidence to prove to a criminal level that the killing was a gay hate crime, even if it was 'very likely' to have been motivated by the victim's sexuality. The outcome ends a long-running ordeal for Johnson's family who pursued justice for more than three decades, refusing to believe an initial police inquest which found the death was a suicide. Speaking outside court after the sentencing, Scott Johnson's brother Steve also thanked murderer Scott White for looking at family members and listening while they made their statements in court. 'We came to Australia this week and we were given a chance to express in court what we lost and the impact that Scott White had on our families... the impact that he had on my brother... and the beautiful man he destroyed,' Johnson said. 'What we got this week was fairness. 'We didn't get compensation for Scott this week but what Scott got was dignity.' Justice Wilson spent more than an hour explaining how she arrived at the sentence of 12 years and seven months with a non-parole period of eight years and three months.  She found that White has punched Johnson at North Head in Manly, causing the young doctor to fall to his death on the rocks below, likely on the night of 8 December. '[White] did a violent act and that act is the direct cause of Dr Johnson leaving the clifftop in terror,' the judge said. Wilson explained the assault had been done with a reckless indifference to human life, noting the punch occurred atop an unguarded cliff and White never alerted police after Johnson fell. She noted mitigating factors that stopped her from handing down a life sentence included White's guilty plea, his challenging childhood, mental health issues and long-term alcohol abuse. While Johnson's family had hoped the case would be ruled a gay hate crime, sister Rebecca hoped it would serve as a beacon for other families who lost men around the same time in similar circumstances, and prove to police these cases were worth pursuing decades later. 'I do feel like our journey has shed light on that era,' she said outside court. 'We've spent three decades asking questions that have no answers and today I feel like we've had answers and we've had justice... for our brother and that's for the men bashed or killed in that era.' New South Wales Police Detective Chief Inspector, Peter Yeomans, who took over the case in 2018, praised the Johnsons for their humility and strength over three decades of hardship. 'They're remarkable,' Yeomans said. 'What they've gone through over the last 30 years and [to] still have the humility here today to thank people... we will never know because we've never been in that position. They're just all remarkable people.' The story is not yet over, however. An appeal of White's conviction has already been filed after his defence team failed to overturn his guilty plea in January.", "448729bbe7ce6f20f0869bdd2f61c2c2d13e2694ab4dcd551eb21679": "Six in 10 people think company bosses should be prevented from earning more than 10 times the average paid to employees, according to polling shared exclusively with the Guardian. A poll for the High Pay Centre, a thinktank that campaigns for fairer pay for workers, found that 63% of Britons said chief executives should be paid no more than 10 times the earnings of lower- or mid-ranking employees. The survey of 1,104 UK adults found that only 3% of people thought it was appropriate for chief executives to get paid more than 50 times the company's average pay. In reality, bosses of the 350 biggest UK-listed companies are paid 53 times more than the median employee, according to separate High Pay Centre research published in December 2020. A total of 43 bosses of FTSE 350 companies received more than 100 times as much as the average employee. Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre, said the research revealed 'the extent to which the lives of those at the top and those of everybody else have become so far removed from each other'. He added: 'That's probably not a healthy development. 'Britain's biggest employers dedicate a significant amount of their budget to the pay of a small number of top earners. Redirecting some of this money to low- and middle-income workers would be a good way to raise living standards and address the cost of living crisis but it will require policymakers and business leaders to be a bit more open-minded about whether those at the top really need to be paid so much.' Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, the pharmaceutical company that makes the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, was the highest paid FTSE 100 CEO in 2020, receiving PS15.5m. The other top earners were Experian's Brian Cassin, who got PS10.3m, CRH's Albert Manifold, with PS10m, Laxman Narasimhan of Reckitt Benckiser, with PS9.2m, and Berkeley's Rob Perrins, who collected PS8m in 2020 (the latest full-year figures available). On an hourly basis, the average FTSE 100 chief executive makes more money in four days than the average UK worker earns in the entire year. Frances O'Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: 'The whole workforce deserves to share in the success of a firm, not just those in the boardroom. But over the years executive pay has raced ahead of other workers - and now it's at stratospheric levels. 'It's time to set a maximum ratio between the top earner in each firm and other workers. There should be workers on remuneration committees, to ground decisions in the interests of the whole workforce. And incentive schemes should be open to all workers on the same terms, instead of just giving big bonuses to executives.' The High Pay Centre polling also found that many respondents felt policy measures aimed at distributing wealth more evenly would be more likely to raise living standards than those aimed at increasing economic growth. More than half (56%) of respondents said policies to ensure wealth is shared more evenly would be the best way to improve living standards for those in the middle and at the bottom, while 33% said measures that increase economic growth would be best. Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB union, which represents 600,000 workers, said: 'The very wealthiest raking in a fortune as the average person struggles to make ends meet just isn't fair. And the British public agrees. 'We're facing a cost of living crisis. Chief executives' sky-high pay is a kick in the teeth to working people who make the profits that the richest benefit from. 'We need decent pay rises for working people - and the GMB is fighting for that in workplaces up and down the country.'", "07aa18384f768612c090d4b19df144ee31c7b1aa6bf99fbfcb5cc19e": "", "83e10fa51d85eb5fd5f06cf0e40045f782c3c5348c7d0f07625a5d3b": "Boris Johnson will hail Ukraine's resistance against tyranny as an exemplar for the world as he delivers a virtual address to the country's parliament on Tuesday. Recalling Britain's resolve during the second world war, the UK prime minister will say that 'we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour'. He will say the bravery demonstrated by those who have sought to defend their country from Russian invaders means the war will come to be known as Ukraine's 'finest hour', too. The speech to Ukrainian MPs reciprocates the move made by the country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who gave a historic speech to the House of Commons in March. Johnson will become the first world leader to address the Verkhovna Rada since the conflict began, and seek to show critics he is focused on international affairs despite continuing questions over his leadership. Meanwhile, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has faced fresh questions from Labour about why a company his wife holds a stake in, Infosys, is still reportedly operating in Russia despite assurances it would pull out of the country. The Indian tech company said it would shut its office in Moscow after the invasion of Ukraine and ministers have urged British businesses to cease trading in Russia to help stymie its economy and avoid feeding Vladimir Putin's war chest. With Russia attempting to focus its attention on the south and eastern regions of Ukraine after failing to take the capital, Kyiv, Johnson will attempt to provide a morale boost. He will tell the Ukrainian parliament: 'When my country faced the threat of invasion during the second world war, our parliament - like yours - continued to meet throughout the conflict, and the British people showed such unity and resolve that we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour. 'This is Ukraine's finest hour, an epic chapter in your national story that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come. Your children and grandchildren will say that Ukrainians taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free.' Johnson visited Kyiv last month and other senior western politicians have been to the city recently as well, including the US House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Sunak was urged by Labour to say when Infosys's Russian office would close down and if his family was financially benefiting from the company's continued presence there. His wife, Akshata Murty, holds about a 0.9% share in the company, which was founded by her father. Tulip Siddiq, the shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, said it was 'really important that the chancellor clarifies what is happening here and whether his immediate family is benefiting from Infosys's continued presence in Russia'. She added: 'We can't have a situation where a UK chancellor and his family maintain economic interests in the Putin regime.' A spokesperson for Sunak declined to comment. A spokesperson for Murty said she was 'one of many minority shareholders and has no involvement in the operational decisions of the company' and added: 'This is a matter for Infosys and should be addressed to them.' An Infosys spokesperson said: 'While the company does not have any active relationships with local Russian enterprises, we have a small team of fewer than 100 employees in Russia, which services some of our global clients. We are currently working closely with those clients that are being impacted to enable a smooth transition.'", "bb012f37f7f1ac82bd6a4fece8733fe822291132d78a833c143723b7": "Russia's Bolshoi theatre has upset opera and ballet fans by abruptly cancelling shows this week by directors who have spoken out against the war in Ukraine. The theatre gave no reason for dropping Timofey Kulyabin's production of the opera Don Pasquale and Kirill Serebrennikov's ballet Nureyev, which will be replaced by productions of Rossini's The Barber of Seville and Aram Khachaturian's ballet Spartacus. Serebrennikov, 52, was allowed in March to leave Russia, where he was found guilty in 2020 of embezzling funds at Moscow's Gogol Centre theatre. His supporters say the conviction was revenge for his criticism of authoritarianism and homophobia under the country's president, Vladimir Putin. Serebrennikov said he was not surprised by the Bolshoi's cancellation of Nureyev, which is based on the life of the Russian ballet superstar Rudolf Nureyev, who defected to the west in 1961. The work, which includes a tender scene with his gay lover that tested the Kremlin's stance towards what it calls 'homosexual propaganda', has caused outrage among Russian conservatives. 'This ballet is about man's yearning for freedom. Freedom to create and freedom to live,' Serebrennikov told Agence France-Presse. 'These days Nureyev is inappropriate and impossible on the Bolshoi stage. They are afraid of unnecessary associations and uncomfortable artists,' Serebrennikov added. He called the cancellation a throwback to the Soviet era. 'Nureyev was cancelled at the Bolshoi theatre. Cancellation of Russian culture in Europe, you say? In Russia, they themselves are cancelling culture.' Kulyabin, who has also left Russia, used his Instagram account to express solidarity with Ukraine and ridicule Russia's description of its actions there. In one post, he showed a mocked-up version of the cover of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, replacing the first word of the title with 'Special Operation', the term the Kremlin has used to describe the invasion. 'It's quite obvious that Russia started the war,' Serebrennikov told France 24 in an interview last month and said it was breaking his heart. 'It's war, it's killing people, it's the worst thing [that] ever might happen with civilisation, with mankind ... It's a humanitarian catastrophe, it's rivers of blood,' he said. The Bolshoi performed Spartacus in early April, saying that proceeds would be used to help the families of Russian troops who died in Ukraine. The cancellation of the two shows drew hundreds of mostly critical online comments from ticket holders. Many demanded in vain to know the reason. 'What disrespect to the spectators and artists!' one woman, Valeria, wrote on the Bolshoi's Telegram channel. Several dancers have in recent weeks quit the Bolshoi, including the prima ballerina Olga Smirnova.", "215f134faa7d9fcb7d2963893fd1b7f63f1f0ed80de0f5bd07416e26": "", "a2d1f51662ace109e842d405c3841982c5e0b5a1e968a17ce524ddc8": "", "318f762880c5f4139c2f6695a79c239d5cb0cd9e43b0d13024b1e4bf": "", "fe35b3607b545e6d83666acef2020590190de9ef012b917980b93d8a": "", "9bf0e2371e76d26489a7929959741cfa54820f55b6324323cab8b7ac": "", "7e2d6e20c6a802787c83aab1234714f4ef29570c75994c48b9d45c06": "", "a39518a94013d2c228462f72671eeb946770902145498ea93b3801e2": "", "cbe95ab098e572110b07175021bc7ecd8987694d12b62d8910597b37": "", "07c7271e34a733b64304f5cbfe345d037f6e04bd89d3ff0e7b0e2eb2": "", "3dc903fcce6f8570d12b054101dfe4d72708eb584ff805884ce580d1": "", "092769f4c9be856586c3f9c973c86632f592907e268a28ffea3eb650": "", "6f7e7fabf9fd23b27e0f8f06d03ad86b04009dc1a1aba0c969a6aeaa": "", "82cf1d22922279050f3ee5301e14ca2db006d819a5c465399542d1a6": "", "333c37c3169c674e574ecef27b5ff7c3db8afc08e1ab9f13d9ecda26": "", "4ed92bedda3949a78f99efc8c498fa24ef73e0bb91e8027c32eac3a1": "", "06c46cd9e39cfcf8ce2ce4a9f337197402d1f51f45e4e22b7c94373a": "", "d6496b8e7d318add03f992bb4ab25b6f2db99adcacf37a74ab882788": "The premier of the British Virgin Islands has demanded his immediate release from US custody, arguing he is immune from prosecution on cocaine-smuggling charges because he is the elected, constitutional head of government of the British overseas territory. An attorney for Andrew Fahie made the request in a filing with Miami federal court on Monday. Fahie, 51, was arrested last week during a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sting as he was preparing to board a private jet in Miami. According to a criminal complaint, Fahie and Oleanvine Maynard, his ports director, had been at the airport to meet who they thought were Mexican drug traffickers but in reality were undercover DEA agents. In the criminal complaint, Maynard refers to Fahie as a 'little crook sometimes' who would not hesitate to profit from a plan cooked up with the help of self-proclaimed Lebanese Hezbollah operatives to move mass quantities of cocaine and drug proceeds through the Caribbean island. The shock arrest roiled the British Virgin Islands, where Fahie was already facing allegations of widespread corruption, and seemed to bolster calls to suspend the constitution for two years to clean up government and return to home rule by officials from London. Fahie's attorney did not respond to a request for comment and in her two-page filing did not provide details about her client's immunity claim. Fahie, who also serves as the finance minister, was said to have traveled to Miami to attend a conference for the cruise industry and ahead of his departure had appointed a deputy to act as premier in his absence. But any battle to assert immunity is likely to face numerous obstacles. 'Diplomatic immunity doesn't protect you if you're on your own private boondoggle,' said Dick Gregorie, a former federal prosecutor in Miami who in the 1980s indicted the prime minister of Turks and Caicos, another British colony, on drug charges and the then Panamanian strongman Gen Manuel Noriega. Still, prosecutions of foreign officials are rare and going after the Caribbean island's top elected official would certainly have been greenlit at the highest levels of the US justice department and state department given the potential impact. For example, federal prosecutors in New York waited for Honduras's President Juan Orlando Hernandez to step down this year before indicting him on allegations of drug trafficking that first came to light in the trial of his brother. 'This isn't done willy-nilly. Prosecutors are clearly very confident in the evidence,' said Gregorie. The string of islands of 35,000 people east of Puerto Rico is currently under a 2007 constitution giving it limited self-governance. Governor John Rankin, who is the Queen's representative to the islands and its ultimate executive authority, said the arrests prompted him to release - earlier than originally intended - a report by a commission of inquiry launched in January 2021 to investigate allegations of widespread government fraud. Rankin said the inquiry concluded that millions of dollars were spent on projects, some of them linked to allies of the premier, that were abandoned or found to be of no public benefit. 'Some of them were, on their face, false,' the governor said. The commission had concluded that 'unless the most urgent and drastic steps are taken, the current situation with elected officials deliberately ignoring the tenants of good governance will go on indefinitely', Rankin told the televised news conference.", "e93f872ad09359ccd062beec449bd9a401bde5413139a0ece5e5fbf6": "New Zealand's former deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, has been banned from parliament grounds for two years for visiting anti-vaccine-mandate protesters who occupied the grounds. The weeks-long February protests, modelled on the Canadian truckers' 'freedom convoy', took over parliament grounds and blocked off a number of surrounding streets. In the first days of the occupation, the speaker issued a trespass notice to all attendees. But efforts by police to disperse the gathering were repeatedly repelled, until it descended into a violent riot, with at least 40 injured, while tents, piles of rubble and a playground were set aflame. Peters, who was deputy prime minister in Jacinda Ardern's first coalition government, had visited the occupation in its earlier days, saying, 'I hope to encourage the protesters to demand that they be heard.' Peters on Tuesday said he had received a two-year trespass notice for that visit, blaming House speaker Trevor Mallard for the decision. 'This dictatorial behaviour ... should be reserved for third world banana republics,' he said in a statement quoted by Newshub. 'What's more astounding is that the speaker of the House of Representatives in our country could possibly attempt to trespass former members of parliament - of whom some are leaders of political parties planning to run against the sitting government in around eighteen months' time.' There was a difference between those who visited the precinct and those who took an 'active part in the protest', he added. Peters lost his parliamentary spot after his party failed to win 5% of the vote, but says he intends to run in the next election. He was not the only one to receive a trespass notice. Ex-National party MP Matt King, who also plans to run in the next New Zealand election with the newly formed Democracy NZ party, received a notice in late April. Violation of the notices could result in a fine of up to a $1,000 or up to three months' imprisonment. In New Zealand, the speaker has responsibility for parliament's grounds and buildings. Mallard generated headlines for his unusual tactics in trying to evict the protesters from the lawn - including turning on the sprinklers, and blasting Barry Manilow from parliament's loudspeakers. Often, those tactics appeared to backfire, galvanising rather than discouraging the crowds. Ardern told Stuff the decision rested with Mallard, but she had asked that he discuss the decision with all parties to try to reach consensus. 'Ultimately, this does sit with the Speaker, but I think it is useful for parties to be able to hear him out about how he came to the decision and to make a joint decision, as much as they're able to, about whether or not MPs should ultimately be treated differently than everyone else.' Mallard did not respond to a request for comment.", "98bb6b09cdf1d972f9429b30774e660f1340c8947df730822d0e4b44": "A week after Elon Musk finalized a $44bn deal to purchase Twitter, the billionaire is working to secure outside funding for the acquisition that would tie up less of his personal fortune. The world's richest person is in talks with large investment firms and high net-worth individuals to take on more financing, Reuters reported Monday. Though Musk has an estimated net worth of about $245bn, much of his fortune is tied up in stocks. The Tesla CEO disclosed last week he had sold $8.5bn worth of stock following his agreement to buy Twitter. Additional financing, which could come in the form of preferred or common equity, could reduce the $21bn cash contribution that Musk has committed to the deal as well as a margin loan he secured against his Tesla shares, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The banks that agreed last month to provide $13bn in loans based on Twitter's business balked at offering more debt for Musk's acquisition given the San Francisco-based company's limited cashflow, Reuters reported last month. Musk has also pledged some of his Tesla shares to banks to arrange a $12.5bn margin loan to help fund the deal. He may seek to trim the size of the margin loan based on the new investor interest in the deal financing, one of the sources said. Major investors such as private equity firms, hedge funds and high net-worth individuals are in talks with Musk about providing preferred equity financing for the acquisition, the sources said. Preferred equity would pay a fixed dividend from Twitter, in the same way that a bond or a loan pays regular interest but would appreciate in line with the equity value of the company. Apollo Global Management Inc and Ares Management Corp are among the private equity firms that have been in talks about providing the financing, the sources added. Musk is still deciding whether he will have partners team up with him in writing the equity check needed for the deal, the sources said. Musk is not seeking to take on more debt for the Twitter deal currently, the sources added. Musk has also been in talks with some of Twitter's major shareholders about the possibility of them rolling their stake into the deal rather than cashing out, one of the sources said. Rolling stake involves selling the majority of shares in a company while retaining a minority ownership interest. The former Twitter chief executive and current board member Jack Dorsey is examining whether he will roll his take, one source added. Large institutional investors, such as Fidelity, are also in talks about rolling over their stake, according to the source. Musk has tweeted that he would try to keep as many investors in Twitter as possible as he takes the company private. The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Musk, Dorsey, Fidelity, Apollo and Ares did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Investors have been fretting over whether Musk will complete the Twitter deal given that he has backtracked in the past. In April, he decided at the last minute not to take up a seat on Twitter's board. In 2018, Musk tweeted that there was 'funding secured' for a $72bn deal to take Tesla private but did not move ahead with an offer. Musk would have to pay a $1bn termination fee to Twitter if he walked away, and the social media company could also sue him to complete the deal. Twitter shares rose 1.2% to $49.63 in afternoon trading in New York on Monday, closer to the $54.20 a share acquisition price, as investors interpreted the news on the new financing as more certainty for the deal closing. On Monday, the social media company said in a filing that false or spam accounts represented fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily active users during the first quarter. The company had 229 million users who were served advertising in the first quarter.The disclosure came days after Musk tweeted that one of his priorities would be to remove 'spam bots' from the platform. Twitter said in the filing it faced several risks until the deal with Musk is closed, such as whether advertisers would continue to spend on Twitter and 'potential uncertainty regarding our future plans and strategy'. Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, has criticized Twitter's moderation policies. He wants Twitter's algorithm for prioritizing tweets to be public and objects to giving too much power on the service to corporations that advertise.

She is charged with two counts under the country's the Anti-Corruption Act, with each count punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a fine. Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained since the army ousted her elected government in February 2021 and has not been seen or allowed to speak in public since then. She is being tried in closed sessions and her lawyers cannot speak publicly on her behalf or about her trial because of a gag order placed on them. She has already been sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment after being convicted of illegally importing and possessing walkie-talkies, violating coronavirus restrictions, sedition and another corruption charge. Aung San Suu Kyi's supporters and human rights groups have said the cases against her are an attempt to discredit her and legitimise the military's seizure of power, eliminating the possibility of her taking part in a possible 2023 election. But widespread resistance to the army's takeover has resulted in what some UN experts have characterised as a civil war, challenging the military's ability to govern. Monday's opening of Aung San Suu Kyi's latest trial was confirmed by a legal official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to release information. In this latest case, she is accused of receiving money in 2019 and 2020 from Maung Weik, a tycoon who previously was convicted of drug trafficking. State television under control of the military government last year showed a video in which Maung Weik claimed to have given cash payoffs to government ministers to help his businesses. Ye Htet, an official from the Anti-Corruption Commission who is a plaintiff in the case, gave testimony in Monday's proceedings, said the legal official, who said payments Maung Weik made in 2019 and 2020 were being treated as separate counts. The Global New Light of Myanmar, a state-controlled newspaper, reported in February the official charges that Aung San Suu Kyi in her position as state counsellor - the country's de facto chief executive - received $550,000 in four instalments in 2019-2020 'to facilitate the business activities of a private entrepreneur.' Maung Weik in his statements in state media last year said he gave the money from 2018 to 2020. He said in his video that the money included $100,000 provided to Aung San Suu Kyi in 2018 for a charitable foundation named after her mother and also gave Aung San Suu Kyi $450,000 in payments from 2019 to 2020 for purposes he did not specify. Under Aung San Suu Kyi's government, Maung Weik won a major development project that included the construction of houses, restaurants, hospitals, economic zones, port and hotel zones in Myanmar's central Mandalay region. Maung Weik, as chairman of a property development company, was close to some of the generals in power during a previous military-run government. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2008 for drug trafficking and was released in 2014 under a semi-democratic transitional government led by former generals. After his release, he returned to doing business with former generals. Overall, Aung San Suu Kyi has been charged with 12 counts of corruption. She was convicted last week on one corruption charge and given a five-year prison sentence after being found guilty of receiving $600,000 and seven gold bars from Phyo Min Thein, the former chief minister of Yangon, the country's biggest city. Her lawyers are trying to overturn the verdict in an appeal to the supreme court on technical grounds, saying the case should not have been heard. If that is rejected, they can still make another appeal.", "61594c11231923063d4fa757804b69f44db9f770909cde8c7f020cae": "Donald Trump's 'impenetrable' border wall has resulted in increased migrant deaths and devastating injuries from falling, according to a new study that analyzed the effect of the new barriers on a southern California hospital. The US replaced more than 400 miles of existing barriers that were between six and 17ft tall with a 30-ft steel wall, and added nearly 50 miles of new barrier under the former president, who campaigned on the promise of 'securing' America's borders and routinely demonized migrants. The wall has been far from Trump's promise of being 'virtually impenetrable' - smugglers breached what he called the 'Rolls-Royce' of barriers more than 3,000 times since its construction. Though the former president said his wall 'can't be climbed', migrants have continued scaling the barrier, facing great peril. Last month a woman died while attempting to scale the wall in eastern Arizona after her leg became trapped in a climbing harness and she was left hanging upside down. A study, published in the Jama surgery journal on Friday, found an unprecedented increase in the number of falls from the border wall in San Diego and Imperial counties. The report is one of the first efforts to calculate the effects of Trump's wall on migrants, according to the Washington Post, as federal officials don't track deaths and injuries related to falls from the barrier. The University of California San Diego trauma center, which treats patients with border wall injuries, saw a five-time increase in the number of people admitted with falling injuries from 67 cases between 2016 and 2018 to 375 cases between 2019 and 2021. During that same time, the number of deaths rose from zero to 16, according to the report, which cites data from the San Diego county medical examiner's office. Trauma doctors say the rise in injuries is related to the increase of the height of the border wall. 'The height increase of the border wall along the San Ysidro and El Centro sectors was touted as making the barrier 'unclimbable', but that has not stopped people from attempting to do so with consequential results,' said Amy Liepert, an author of the study and medical director of acute care surgery at UC San Diego Health. 'This is an unseen public health crisis happening right now.' Most of the patients the hospital treated had 'significant brain and facial injuries or complex fractures of the extremities or spine', many of which required 'intensive care and staged operative reconstructions'. Because patients largely did not have health insurance they were ineligible for rehabilitation centers or physical therapy, and had longer hospital stays. The costs of the increase in patients was more than $13m, and further burdened the trauma center as it grappled with rising Covid cases amid the pandemic, according to the study. 'The care of these injured immigrants is not only a humanitarian problem but also a public health crisis that further worsened trauma center bed capacity, staff shortages, and professionals' moral injury,' the authors wrote. The taller border wall has made what was already a perilous journey for migrants even riskier. At least 7,000 people are believed to have died along the US-Mexico border since 1998, the Guardian reported in 2021.", "a86c28f127161fe71277549a200adaf708da886584f1c172a55004dd": "The sister of Lyra McKee has called the timing of a leaked letter, reportedly from Sinn Fein, to a group accused of having links to the dissident republican group allegedly behind the journalist's murder, 'exploitative of the tragedy for political purposes'. The two-year-old letter, from Sinn Fein's Declan Kearney, reportedly referenced a potential 'cooperation agreement' between Saoradh and Sinn Fein over achieving a border poll.  It was an attempt to 'work towards unity and changing the constitutional position, but only by consent, only by the public working together' according to Sinn Fein's vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, as she confirmed Kearney had written a letter to Saoradh. However, Nichola McKee Corner, Lyra's sister, called the leaking of the letter, at a divisive time for Sinn Fein's electoral campaign, an exploitation of Lyra's murder.  In a statement, McKee Corner questioned 'the timing of the publication of this letter (given that it is over two years old) and the links made to my murdered sister', and added that those responsible for leaking it 'should hang their heads in shame for using my beloved sister in this way'. McKee Corner said she was aware of Sinn Fein's 'efforts to encourage dissident republican groups, including Saoradh, to move away from violence and engage with the political process' since 2019, and that this 'encouragement has been unsuccessful to date'. She went on to urge Saoradh and the other dissident groups to 'accept that the war is over' and that 'they need to relinquish violence once and for all'. McKee, a promising young journalist from Northern Ireland who wrote about the consequences of the Troubles, was 29 when she was murdered in Creggan, Derry in 2019, after she was hit by a bullet while she was reporting violent clashes between the New IRA and the police. Two men have since been charged with her murder. McKee's partner, Sara Canning, also expressed scepticism about the timing of the release, saying that news of the letter did not surprise her and that she believed it was inevitable there would be attempts to try to bring Saoradh 'into the fold to a degree'. 'I'm not a Sinn Fein fan but that's how things were done in the 1990s, and that's how violence was brought to an end here, we brought the people into the political realm,' she told the BBC. The release of the letter comes at a time described by O'Neill as a 'moment in history and a moment for real change' - in an election video posted on Twitter - with polls are predicting Sinn Fein to secure a majority in the upcoming assembly elections, which would allow the party to nominate the first ever republican first minister in Northern Ireland.", "814c21487c04e784d0872c0c7bb4994aa1ad8d8ed104426ed2f2c2e3": "", "a888ff8dc0cb2a410c95adb47fc900081ca5b5c1ad6152db7eafbeb3": "The Spanish government has said the mobile phones of the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, and the defence minister, Margarita Robles, were both infected last year with the Pegasus spyware that its manufacturers claim is available only to state agencies. In a hastily convened press conference on Monday morning, Felix Bolanos, the minister for the presidency, said Sanchez's phone was targeted in May and June 2021, while Robles's was targeted in June 2021. Data was extracted from both phones. Bolanos said the 'illicit' and 'external' targeting would be investigated by Spain's highest criminal court, the Audiencia Nacional, adding the targeting must have come from abroad as any such monitoring in Spain would have had required judicial authorisation. 'These facts have been confirmed and are irrefutable,' said Bolanos. 'I don't think now is the time to engage in supposition or conjecture about what the motivation may have been.' The phones of other members of the government are being examined to determine whether they may also have been targeted. The allegations come as the Spanish government faces questions over how Pegasus - which is sold by the Israeli company NSO Group - allegedly came to be used to monitor dozens of members of the Catalan independence movement, including the president of the north-eastern Spanish region, Pere Aragones, and three of his predecessors. Last month, Aragones told the Guardian the alleged targeting, revealed by Citizen Lab cybersecurity experts, constituted a violation of individual rights, an attack on democracy, and a threat to political dissent. The Catalan regional government has pointed the finger at Spain's National Intelligence Centre (CNI), which insists its operations are overseen by the supreme court and that it acts 'in full accordance with the legal system, and with absolute respect for the applicable laws'. The Spanish government has promised an internal CNI investigation into the alleged targeting of Catalan activists, while Spain's public ombudsman has also opened an independent investigation. Aragones has called for Robles - who oversees the CNI as defence minister - to resign, and his Catalan Republican Left party has threatened to withhold its support for the government in the national parliament. The Catalan president said in a statement: 'Any political espionage is extremely serious. We reported spying a few days ago but were not given an explanation by the Spanish government. When it's massive spying on Catalan institutions and the independence movement, it was all silence and excuses. With this, it's all moving very fast. Responsibility needs to be established straight away. A thorough, independent investigation remains urgent and responsibility needs to be taken.' NSO Group said in a statement it would investigate 'any suspicion of misuse' of its software, and would cooperate with any governmental investigation. 'While we have not seen any information related to this alleged misuse and we are not familiar with the details of this specific case, NSO's firm stance on these issues is that the use of cyber tools in order to monitor politicians, dissidents, activists and journalists is a severe misuse of any technology and goes against the desired use of such critical tools,' said a spokesperson. 'NSO is a software provider; the company does not operate the technology nor is privy to the collected data. The company does not and cannot know who the targets of its customers are, yet implements measures to ensure that these systems are used solely for the authorised uses.' NSO Group claims Pegasus is sold only to governments to track criminals and terrorists. A joint investigation two years ago by the Guardian and El Pais established that the speaker of the Catalan regional parliament and at least two other pro-independence supporters were warned the spyware had been used to target them. NSO group was placed on a US blacklist in November 2021, three months after a consortium of journalists working with the French non-profit group Forbidden Stories revealed multiple cases of journalists and activists who were hacked by foreign governments using the spyware, including American citizens. The Guardian and other members of the consortium also revealed that the mobile numbers of Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and almost his entire cabinet appeared on a leaked list of individuals who were selected as possible targets of surveillance. NSO has said its spyware is used by foreign government clients to target serious criminals. It has also denied that any of its clients ever targeted Macron or any French government officials.", "dcff8f2fb228ad3a7b240310f656141d25d075a8950b0249546bd78d": "Speaking at a rally two days ahead of voting in a heated Republican Senate primary in Ohio, Donald Trump appeared to forget the name of JD Vance, the candidate he has endorsed. 'You know,' the former president told a crowd in Greenwood, Nebraska, on Sunday, 'we've endorsed Dr Oz.' So he has, in Pennsylvania. Of Ohio, Trump said: 'We've endorsed - JP, right? JD Mandel, and he's doing great. They're all doing good. They're all doing good. And let's see what happens.'' Trump appeared to be confusing JD Vance, a former US marine, author of the bestseller Hillbilly Elegy and venture capitalist, with Josh Mandel, a rival who courted Trump for the endorsement. Trump also said: 'I think Vance is doing well, I think Oz is doing well. Does everybody like Oz? I love Oz.' Announcing his endorsement last month, Trump said: 'In the great state of Ohio, the candidate most qualified and ready to win in November is JD Vance. We cannot play games. It is all about winning!' Vance said then he was 'incredibly honored to have President Trump's support'. He did not immediately comment about Trump's slip on Sunday. Trump's endorsement - despite past remarks in which Vance called Trump 'America's Hitler' and 'a moral disaster' - boosted Vance to the top of the polls in Ohio. On Sunday, Mandel continued to hammer his opponent for such remarks, including saying in 2016 he might vote for Hillary Clinton if it seemed Trump might win. Another candidate, Mike Gibbons, told donors in an email reported by Politico: 'To be fair, you really can't blame Trump. No one knows who the real JD Vance is, as his views change faster than the weather in Ohio.' In the same rally, Trump, 75, mocked Joe Biden, 79 and the president who beat him in 2020, for stumbling over his words. Biden has often discussed his struggle to overcome a stutter. Amid widespread delight over Trump's Vance-Mandel slip, the columnist Julia Davis referred to a notorious interview in which Trump discussed passing a cognitive test which he insisted was 'difficult'. Davis wrote: 'Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. JP. JD. Mandel. Oh hell.' Trump's rally on Sunday was in support of Charles Herbster, a candidate for governor in Nebraska who - like Trump - faces accusations of sexual assault and misconduct. 'I defend people when I know they're good,' Trump said. 'A lot of people, they look at you and say: 'You don't have to do it, sir.' I defend my friends.'", "bdff16bf695856b47d7a2210adc90acb38f0d4badcc76f44486893c3": "A 'highly enterprising' four-year-old boy was reunited with his parents unscathed after grabbing his mother's keys and taking her car for an early-morning drive through the streets of Utrecht in the Netherlands, police have said. The boy, in pyjamas and bare feet, was spotted wandering on a street in the city's Overvecht district early on Saturday morning by bystanders who called emergency services, the North Utrecht police force said on its Instagram account. After receiving a medical check-up and a cuddly bear from an ambulance crew, the toddler - with no immediate sign of any parents in the vicinity - was taken to the nearest police station and given a mug of hot chocolate, the post said. Soon afterwards, a police patrol reported that a car had been abandoned in the same neighbourhood, apparently after first colliding with two parked vehicles. A call to the registered owner of the car revealed it to be the boy's mother. 'She explained that her son was 'highly enterprising',' police said. 'She spoke to the child on the phone, and we saw him imitate a collision and make a steering movement with his hands. This made us suspect he might have been driving.' Officers accompanied the mother and her son to the abandoned car, where they were joined by the boy's father. 'At the car, we asked the child if he could show us how it worked,' Utrecht police recounted in their Instagram post. 'He opened the car, and put the key in the ignition. He started the car, moved his left foot to the clutch, and hit the accelerator.' They concluded that he had been 'woken up early when his father left to go to work, and decided to go for a drive'. Fortunately, police said in their post - titled 'New Max Verstappen discovered in Overvecht', in a reference to the 2021 Belgian-Dutch Formula One world champion - 'this mini boy-racer's adventure ended with a fizzle'.", "3f742aa14980cb71f1c820bb29aa13fb5f53ac8a25026dc233bcda3a": "", "a478e2f5eed47b26a75a479a27e643945ef25334ac0f0f12f3c55a96": "", "a275c6f4676b742ac3b28b701d86ee3b79966725948f958998959590": "", "2bece37300b8907463d64cb550e118ec5ab77563baaf18e666d9285e": "", "da17a2c59002b1fb7d9ff9de913dcfbbb14d9fe01a2cfbbab7a9cd08": "", "d9831f3c3d5d4302351ed9e1701f1341b8397200bdee1dbb6ded1330": "", "06d6d36e076767f380a00946310a1e7e5d56a65de316ea4599503c6d": "", "a3e37a3b797335a4c28c055606249972eddd4a095c57a3eb451e1dac": "", "eea1c9300054fe2313a1cbfc50996004bfbd851694f73d7f8c2a0bc3": "", "6bdbf4817c97f8c16367c1f16012aee3ac4615ebf5ec86b06d5e2025": "", "9042e5942400a7a945fee711cd007e2601064e01f1be3686102256a9": "Netflix faces the threat of an exodus of a number of hit shows as it battles to reignite subscriber growth, with almost a third of its most popular content with British viewers - from Friends and Pretty Little Liars to Paw Patrol - licensed from rivals building their own streaming services. Earlier this month, Netflix's market value was slashed by almost $60bn as investors panicked that the decade-long streaming boom has come to an end, after the company forecast it would lose millions of subscribers in the first half of this year. Netflix invests billions of dollars annually in original content - starting with House of Cards in 2013 and extending to recent hits such as Squid Game, Ozark and Bridgerton - in a long-term strategy designed to insulate its business from the impact of Hollywood rivals pulling content they license for their own rival services. However, research shows that Netflix continues to have a significant dependency on licensed content, with major titles potentially moving off the service when contracts come up for renewal in the next few years. In the first two months of this year, 31% of the 150 most-viewed shows and films by British users belonged to Netflix's competition, and a quarter of all viewing was to content owned by rivals with streaming services of their own, according to the research firm Digital i. 'There is certainly risk for Netflix,' says Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere. 'A significant number of its highest-performance titles are licensed from studios with in-house streaming ambitions of their own.' Friends, the most popular show among British viewers and Netflix's biggest hit globally, has already been removed by Warner Bros Discovery in the US along with other hits such as The Big Bang Theory to drive its own HBO Max service. HBO Max is yet to launch in the UK, with Warner Bros Discovery locked in a content deal with Sky until 2025 that blocks the launch of a standalone streaming service. Sky-owner Comcast has also removed big hits such as the US version of The Office to make its Peacock streaming service more attractive in the US, but it has so far decided not to launch it as a standalone streaming rival to Netflix in the UK. 'The nation's favourite American sitcoms are safe - for now,' says Ali Vahdati, chief executive of Digital i. 'In the long term, Netflix will need to extricate itself from such a strong reliance on US major Hollywood studio content, or else risk high levels of churn when others launch fully in the market.' This summer, Paramount is launching Paramount+ in the UK and has almost completely removed the Star Trek franchise from Netflix, which Digital i estimates to be worth over PS50m to Netflix across Europe. Popular Paramount-owned content that is still on Netflix but likely to move when deals expire include the Sonic the Hedgehog film, the SpongeBob Movie, The Wolf of Wall Street and films The Gentleman and Mother/Android. However, Netflix's originals strategy continues to be hugely successful with shows such as Stay Close, Ozark, Inventing Anna, Cobra Kai and films including Power of the Dog, Don't Look Up and Red Notice all major hits with subscribers globally. 'We know that having fresh, new content is what helps drive new sign-ups, and this is where Netflix has much more security in its offer,' says Broughton. 'Of the titles which were first released in 2021 and 2022, Netflix Originals dominate. Just 10% of the most popular shows and movies that were released since the start of 2021 were not Netflix Originals (or Exclusives). So while there is inevitably a risk if popular titles driving consumption are lost, Netflix does have a huge range of alternative options for subscribers.' Netflix hitting a subscriber wall has sent shock waves through the industry and is likely to lead to rivals reassessing how attractive, and profitable, the streaming model can be. The decision by players such as Disney+ to cut all content licensing deals to provide TV series and films exclusively to subscribers to its own service only works if Disney+ can be built to a massive scale. Netflix, which plans to focus on a 'less is more' strategy of fewer but higher-quality commissions of series and films, is estimated to be spending $17bn making and licensing content this year. The cuts, which are likely to include job losses, are already being felt with Netflix reportedly axing an animated family TV series from the production company set up by Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry. Rival Disney, which owns assets including Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and the ABC TV network, is spending $33bn in 2022. Warner Bros Discovery is expected to spend $20bn. 'The recent streaming slowdown is prompting a number of investors and executives to revisit prior assumptions about how large the siloed direct-to-consumer model can become,' says Broughton. 'So it is not at all clear that Netflix will lose access to all major studio content in the future. I suspect a number of the majors won't take the same purist angle adopted by Disney, and instead will take a more mercenary approach, windowing titles and licensing content to third parties where they can achieve solid rights fees.'

The uninvited guest surprised Naples homeowners Karyn and Jamie Dobson when they opened the connecting door from their house after hearing a crash, WINK News reported. 'I open the door about a quarter way, peek my head in, and there's the alligator,' Jamie Dobson said. He said the 8ft crocodilian was backing away, with froth from the cans all over the floor. The couple had purchased several slabs of sodas for Karyn Dobson's party a few days later. 'There was Diet Coke spewing everywhere because the gator tore open the box [and] had a few cans, probably thought it was beer maybe,' she said. 'We were all standing there like a scaredy cat. People have sent me texts and emails ... they have all these comments [like] 'What a great birthday present.'' The alligator is believed to have sneaked in after the couple returned from walking their dog and neglected to close the garage door. The Dobsons said they had recently moved to the area from Chicago and were not aware of the danger of leaving the garage door open. '[It's] something [that being] from the midwest I really haven't experienced before,' Jamie Dobson said. A trapper caught the alligator and relocated it to a non-residential area. Alligator encounters in built-up communities are more frequent during mating season, which began in April and lasts until June as the reptiles emerge from the swamps and go looking for a partner. Wildlife officials say they rarely pose a direct threat to humans. 'Alligators seldom bite people for reasons other than food,' the Florida fish and wildlife commission says in its human-alligator incidents fact sheet, which notes the state has a 'healthy' population of about 1.3 million of the reptiles. 'Female alligators may protect their nests by hissing and opening their mouths to frighten intruders but rarely bite people. Alligator bites are most likely to occur in or around water.'", "5814ea5560fbb71f45e1853c6cf4ce88674ed2c2fb9ffe5c967b65a8": "The night that six Cambodian police officers dragged Prum Chantha's teenage son out of their home for criticising the government in a group chat, she was so distraught that her neighbours insisted on sleeping on her floor to watch over her. Her husband was already one of more than 100 activists and politicians charged with alleged treason or incitement against Cambodia's ruling party. Now Kak Sovannchhay, a 16-year-old with autism whose crime was defending his father on Telegram, would join him in Prey Sar prison. But within a week, Chantha returned to the ritual she had started a year earlier, walking the streets of Phnom Penh with her petition. 'I can't be weak. I have to stand up for myself,' says Chantha.For two years, she has led a group of women - sometimes just a dozen - to picket Phnom Penh's courts and international embassies, facing arrest and violence as they demand the release of their family members. Chantha's son, who was arrested in June 2021, came home after five months in prison but her husband is still awaiting his case, one of four mass trials against opposition leaders and supporters that many see as Prime Minister Hun Sen's attempt to stamp out growing dissent to his 37 years of rule. Chantha's group, a rare voice of defiance in Cambodia, are known as the 'Friday wives' for their weekly protests. 'Physically, they're putting their lives and their bodies on the line,' says Theary Seng, a Cambodian-American lawyer and activist who is facing her own ongoing court proceedings. 'Here are 20 women with no weapons, holding signs, wearing T-shirts of their loved ones, being assaulted left and right.' On a sweltering April morning the women wore wide-brimmed hats and white T-shirts bearing photos of their jailed family members as they marched down a busy road to sit on the grass verge outside the Australian embassy in Phnom Penh. On 3 May, the closing arguments are expected at a hearing for about 60 of 130 activists whom the state has been prosecuting since 2020.  The protests follow a familiar arc: they rally in front of the municipal court or royal palace before delivering a petition to one of many embassies. 'We're looking for democratic countries and signatories,' Chantha says. She has already met embassy officials from the US, Indonesia, the UK and the EU.  When they first began, in June 2020, the Friday wives were very nervous, say Ouk Chanthy, a garment worker whose husband is serving a 44-month prison sentence. He was one of 20 people handed sentences of up to 10 years in mid-March. 'I didn't know how advocacy works,' she says. 'The first time I joined the protest, I was scared the authorities would threaten me.' Police have shoved and kicked the women countless times, threatened them with arrest and have violently removed them from public spaces. They meditate together before each protest and call out constant words of encouragement. The day her husband was convicted, two guards confronted Chanthy as she held up his photo and dragged her along the ground until her palm bled. 'I used to feel scared,' she says, touching the place where she has a pale scar. 'They have threatened us, pushed us, pulled us, until all my fear was gone.' Mu Sochua, an exiled opposition leader, has watched the women from afar as they grew from a group of strangers to an unflinching mutual support network. Their message has also expanded to broader themes of democracy and freedom of expression. 'It's very clear that they have moved beyond fighting for themselves and their husbands - they have moved toward justice for all,' says Sochua. 'Listening to their interviews, I hear that they don't consider themselves as victims, but as real players, real leaders in bringing change.' The group bears more than physical scars: members of Chantha's family have blocked her on Facebook and on mobile phones to avoid being targeted by the authorities by association. Many of the women have struggled to find people who will employ them. Chantha can afford to visit her husband once a week, squeezing her protests between trekking to the prison, caring for her son and helping her niece sell clothes. But she has no plans to stop. 'It's unacceptable that families are subject to threats and intimidation,' she says. 'The authorities assault us, shoot us, hit us, arrest us and threaten us - yet we cannot even criticise them.'

Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe told reporters in Washington on Monday: 'This is straight out of the Kremlin's playbook,' he added. Carpenter said that the United States also believed Russia was considering a similar plan in a third region, Kherson, where Moscow has recently solidified its control and imposed use of its ruble currency. Carpenter said it was also possible that Russia's leaders would try to take over other parts of Ukraine, by imposing 'puppets and proxies' in local governments and forcing out democratically elected officials.

Thank you for following today's live coverage of the war in Ukraine.  This blog is closed - however our coverage continues here. Russia is replenishing significant losses of equipment and continuing to focus on establishing complete control over the settlements of Rubizhne and Popasna in the Donetsk region, Ukraine's military claims.  Ukrainian defenders successfully thwarted 24 Russian attacks, as well as destroying six tanks, five artillery systems and 22 units of combat armoured equipment, according to the latest operational report from Ukraine's general staff of the armed forces. Here are some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today.  The US has provided Ukraine with much-needed military support including Javelins, Stingers, howitzers and other material being hustled to Eastern Europe to resupply Ukraine's military in its fight against Russia. However, a growing concern has emerged as the war drags on: can the US sustain the cadence of shipping vast amounts of arms to Ukraine while maintaining its own stockpile? The US already has provided about 7,000 Javelins, including some that were delivered during the Trump administration, about one-third of its stockpile, to Ukraine, according to an analysis by Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies international security program.  Analysts also estimate that the US has sent about one-quarter of its stockpile of shoulder-fired Stinger missiles to Ukraine. Raytheon Technologies CEO Greg Hayes told investors last week during a quarterly call that his company, which makes the weapons system, wouldn't be able to ramp up production until next year due to parts shortages.  'Could this be a problem? The short answer is, Probably, yes,'' Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and former government specialist on Pentagon budget strategy, war funding and procurement, told the Associated Press. Cancian, the former government specialist on defence budget strategy, said the fact that Stingers and Javelins were not included in the most recent tranche of weapons the Biden administration announced it was sending to Ukraine could be a sign that Pentagon officials are mindful about inventory as they conduct contingency planning for other possible conflicts. 'There's no question that whatever war plan they're looking at there is risk associated with the depleting levels of Stingers and Javelins, and I'm sure that they're having that discussion at the Pentagon,' he said. Pentagon officials recently sat down with some of the leading defence contractors, including Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman to discuss efforts to ramp up production. The European Commission may spare Hungary and Slovakia from a soon-to-be-prepared embargo on buying Russian oil, accounting for the two countries' dependence on Russian crude, two EU officials said on Monday. The Commission is expected to finalise on Tuesday work on the next, and sixth package of EU sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine, which would include a ban on buying Russian oil.  Hungary - which received 58% of its crude oil and oil products imports from Russia last year, according to the International Energy Agency (IAE) - is heavily dependent on Russian oil and has repeatedly said it would not sign up to sanctions involving energy.  Slovakia received 96% of its supply from Russia, according to IEA data. To keep the 27-nation bloc united, the Commission may offer Slovakia and Hungary 'an exemption or a long transition period', one official said, as reported by Reuters. The oil embargo is likely to be phased in, most likely taking full effect from the start of next year, officials said. Overall, the EU is dependent on Russia for 26% of its oil imports. The European Union hopes to pass the sixth round of sanctions against Russia at the next meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council, the bloc's chief diplomat said on Monday. Josep Borrell told a news conference in Panama City, where he is on an official visit, the bloc hopes to curb Russia's energy exports as part of its efforts to sanction Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. The European Commission, the executive branch of the union, is expected to propose the package of EU sanctions this week, including a potential embargo on buying Russian oil - a measure that would deprive Moscow of a large revenue stream. However, many EU countries remain divided. Borrell, who chairs the foreign affairs council meetings, said he hopes the EU will be able to take 'measures to significantly limit these imports' but conceded so far there is no agreement from all the members. 'But I am confident that, at least with regard to oil imports, this agreement will be possible between now and the next Council meeting,' he added. The Council has meetings scheduled for 10 May and 16 May later this month. Here is a little more detail surrounding US claims that Russia plans to 'annex' Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Russia's top general, Valery Gerasimov, visited the Donbas front in the Ukraine war last week, a Pentagon official said. Reports that he was injured in a Ukrainian attack could not be confirmed. 'What we can confirm is that we know that for several days last week he was in the Donbas,' a senior US defense official told journalists on Monday. 'We don't believe that he's still there - that he has left and he's back in Russia,' the official said. 'We cannot confirm reports that he was injured.' According to reports citing Ukraine officials, on Saturday Ukraine forces shelled a command centre in Izium, where Gerasimov, chief of general staff of the Russian armed forces, visited to meet with top field commanders. But he had apparently left the site before the shelling took place, according to Agence France-Presse. Gerasimov was believed to be touring the front to better understand field conditions and rally his troops as Russian forces, after failing to capture Kyiv in the north, attempt to take control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of the east. If you have just joined us, here is a quick re-cap of where things stand: The evacuation of civilians trapped in Mariupol is set to resume on Tuesday, 3 May, the city council announced. In an update over its official Facebook page, officials said an evacuation of civilians has been agreed to start at 7am local time. 'It's official. Evacuation. With the support of the UN and the Red Cross for tomorrow the evacuation of civilians has been agreed,' the council said.  Russian forces in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine -- where the bulk of the fighting is taking place -- are suffering from poor command and control, low morale, and less than ideal logistics, a senior US Defense Department official, has said in a statement on Monday. The Russians have had some minor gains east of the Ukrainian cities of Izyum and Popasna, the official said, adding that that progress has been anaemic.  'What we saw there in Popasna is not unlike what we've seen in other hamlets in the Donbas. [The Russians] will move in and then declare victory and then withdraw their troops only to let the Ukrainians take it back. So, there was a lot of back and forth over the last couple of days,' the official said.  Also, the Pentagon has observed that Russian forces seem to have a risk and casualty aversion in both the air war and the ground war, the official said.  Ukrainian forces continue to hold Kharkiv against nearby Russian forces. The city continues to endure Russian air strikes, the official said.  'But the Ukrainians have been doing an able job over the last 24 to 48 hours of pushing the Russians further away. And they have managed to push the Russians out about 40km to the east of Kharkiv,' the official said.  That's a good example of the stiff and formidable resistance Ukrainian forces are displaying, the official said.  Mariupol continues to get hit with standoff Russian air attacks. 'We continue to see them using dumb bombs in Mariupol,' the official said, referring to ordnance that's not precision-guided. The New York Times is also reporting that some evacuees have successfully arrived from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, on Monday. The group escaped the city in a convoy led by the International Committee for the Red Cross and the UN, the newspaper reports. 'For more than a month, more than 40 of us had to split six tins of food,' one evacuee said.

Usmanova, 37, spoke on Sunday after being evacuated from the plant, a sprawling complex founded under Joseph Stalin and designed with a subterranean network of bunkers and tunnels to withstand attack. 'I feared that the bunker would not withstand it - I had terrible fear,' Usmanova said, describing the time sheltering underground. 'When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical, my husband can vouch for that. I was so worried the bunker would cave in.' She recalled the lack of oxygen in the shelters and the fear that had gripped the lives of people hunkered down there. 'We didn't see the sun for so long,' she said, speaking in the village of Bezimenne in an area of Donetsk under the control of Russia-backed separatists about 30km east of Mariupol. Usmanova was among dozens of civilians evacuated from the plant in Mariupol, a southern port city that has been besieged by Russian forces for weeks and left a wasteland. She said she joked with her husband on the bus ride out, in a convoy agreed by the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross, that they would no longer have to go to the lavatory with a torch. 'You just can't imagine what we have been through - the terror,' Usmanova said. 'I lived there, worked there all my life, but what we saw there was just terrible.' Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said about 100 civilians, primarily women and children, were expected to arrive in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia from the plant on Monday. 'For the first time in all the days of the war, this vitally needed (humanitarian) corridor has started working,' he said in an address published on Telegram. He said he hoped the evacuations would continue on Monday. People fleeing Russian-occupied areas in the past have described their vehicles being fired on, and Ukrainian officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of shelling evacuation routes on which the two sides had agreed. As many as 100,000 people may still be in blockaded Mariupol, including up to 1,000 civilians hunkered down with an estimated 2,000 Ukrainian fighters beneath the Soviet-era steel plant - the only part of the city not occupied by the Russians. Mariupol has been a key target for Vladimir Putin because of its strategic location near the Crimea Peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014.

Ukrainian-born Katya Chizayeva, who now lives in the Louisiana city, organised the event at a restaurant after reading in the Guardian about the plight of residents at the facility in Chasiv Yar, a Donbas village just kilometres away from the frontline. A total of $8,000 (PS6,351) was raised for the nursing home. Without the means to leave, elderly people have borne the brunt of the fighting in the Donbas over the last eight years. The situation only worsened when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February. When the Guardian visited the nursing home in April, most of the residents interviewed had been made homeless by the shelling. The nursing home's director, Ievhen Tkachov, said they are in the process of evacuating the last 12 people - a mixture of those who are bedridden and new residents they have received because of the fighting nearby. 'The biggest chunk of the money will go towards making the accommodation suitable for the old people,' said Tkachov. Tkachov started searching for a place to move the residents when the war started. Having lived under the Russian-backed separatists, Tkachov said they had to leave. 'I know there will be no water, no electricity, no heating, no medicine. This lot will become a mass grave in a matter of days,' said Tkachov, referring to his vulnerable residents. 'We have to go.' Over a month ago he wrote a post on Facebook as he panicked about approaching Russian soldiers. Russian forces have not made much progress along the entrenched 2014-2022 eastern frontline where Chasiv Yar sits. But in the first weeks of the war, they captured swathes of territory to the north and east, encircling Ukrainian-controlled Donbas. A local church in the Khmelnytskyi region of western Ukraine contacted Tkachov. They asked the local authorities for help and a disused school was allocated for the elderly evacuees. Tkachov and his team are in the process of renovating it. So far, they have evacuated more than 30 people to the school. 'We are going to buy a boiler to make it warmer,' said Tkachov, explaining how the money would be spent. 'At the moment it's suitable for a student who comes in for half a day and then goes home but our people will be there full-time.'' 'We want to buy some special beds, they cost around $500,' said Tkachov. Tkachov said the donation had made a big difference, though he lamented the exchange rates. 'There's another nuance,' he said. 'From the $8,000, we only received $7,200 thanks to the [Ukrainian]) state currency exchange system.'", "77cbc95e6d1adab44d6779e39f689676b522968e8662065706bca8a4": "The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has defended himself against accusations that his approach to Russian aggression has been hesitant and timid, insisting his decisions followed close consultation with Germany's allies and sought to avoid any suspicion that the country was 'going it alone'. Scholz has faced fierce criticism even from within his own government and last week came under particular fire from the opposition leader, Friedrich Merz, who accused him of weak leadership and of 'procrastination, dithering and timidity'. On Sunday it was reported that Merz was planning to travel to Kyiv on Monday. Scholz appeared to bow to immense domestic and international pressure last week by announcing that Germany would deliver heavy weaponry to Ukraine, in the form of self-propelled anti-aircraft systems, in what was seen as a sharp policy U-turn. But while the outspoken Ukrainian ambassador to Berlin, Andriy Melnyk, said he welcomed the move, he piled further pressure on Scholz on Sunday by insisting it did not go nearly far enough, and demanding more 'fantasy and courage' from Germany. Responding to the criticism in an interview with the tabloid Bild am Sonntag, Scholz said: 'I am making my decisions quickly and in conjunction with our allies.' He said that 'overhasty actions and Germany going it alone' would be viewed with suspicion. Scholz said: 'I am not fearful enough to allow myself to be affected by such accusations.' He insisted he would not be cowed into changing his strategy by his record-low popularity rating. 'You should notice opinion polls but you should not make your actions dependent on them. Especially regarding questions of war and peace, this would be immensely dangerous,' he said. According to the polling institute Insa, 54% of Germans are unhappy with Scholz's record. Scholz, who has been in office for just under five months, found himself plunged early on into dealing with the dilemma faced by almost every government leader since the second world war - having to tread a thin line between Germany assuming international responsibilities and avoiding accusations both at home and abroad that its actions might drag Europe into another war. Melnyk, who has himself drawn criticism within Germany for his persistent complaints about what he has repeatedly described as the country's lack of decisive action, said that the Gepard anti-aircraft guns promised last week were insufficient and too old. 'The direction is the right one, but of course they are not enough. In particular we're lacking ammunition for the Gepards ... and in addition they are 40 years old. In order to defeat Russia we need the most modern Germany weaponry,' he said, also speaking to Bild. He said his criticism was directed at 'the entire German political class', accusing Germany of being 'very wrapped up in itself' and urging it to 'at last become aware of its enormous historical responsibility'.  Melnyk listed the specific arms he said Ukraine needed Germany to deliver. 'We want the speedy export of 88 Leopard tanks, 100 Marder armoured personnel carriers, self-propelled howitzers and much more. We are experiencing the biggest war in Europe for 80 years. It cannot be won with 30 or 100 more anti-aircraft systems.'  Melnyk acknowledged that Germany had taken in a large number of refugees from Ukraine, including his own mother-in-law. Officially the figure is just under 400,000, according to German border police, although the real number is believed to be much higher as they are not required to register and can be in Germany without a visa for 90 days. 'I am grateful to Germany for every help it gives. But we're talking about life and death in Ukraine, and the survival of my nation,' he said. As debate raged among policymakers in Germany as to when and whether Germany can become independent from Russian gas supplies, the news agency DPA reported that the government was planning to support EU plans for a Russian oil embargo, as part of a sixth round of sanctions about to be announced by the bloc, despite opposition from Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, Spain, Italy and Greece.  Germany has already reduced its dependence on Russian gas from 55% to 35% since the start of the war, but full independence is not expected to be reached until 2024, Robert Habeck, the economics minister, has said.", "333173a2ff73a02fa30556004e6495a2d67a6b6f61c6425de57f02fc": "Russia's online trolling operation is becoming increasingly decentralised and is gaining 'incredible traction' on TikTok with misinformation aimed at sowing doubt over events in Ukraine, a US social media researcher has warned. Darren Linvill, professor at Clemson University, South Carolina, who has been studying the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency (IRA) troll farm operation since 2017, said it was succeeding in creating more authentic-seeming posts. He has identified the sharing of faked factchecking posts and accounts which amplify disinformation by linking between platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and Telegram as current tactics by the IRA, which is now believed to be operating across different locations. On Sunday, the UK government claimed it has identified a former factory in St Petersburg as a new base for trolling operations where 'cyber soldiers are ruthlessly targeting politicians and audiences across a number of countries including the UK, South Africa and India'. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office cited government-funded research, which it has not published, that reportedly shows paid staff in Russia are 'using Telegram to actively recruit and coordinate new supporters who then target the social media profiles of Kremlin critics - spamming them with pro-Putin and pro-war comments'. Linvill said this was 'highly consistent with what we have seen the IRA previously do, given how it understands the power of authenticity'. It was reported that targets have included Boris Johnson's social media accounts as well as accounts of bands and musicians including Daft Punk, David Guetta and Tiesto. The government said it had shared the research with the social media platforms. It said the Russian operation was searching for 'organic content' posted by genuine users consistent with its messaging, and then working to amplify these messages. 'This means that, provided the content they post is not too offensive, they are unlikely to be subject to de-platforming interventions,' an official said. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said: 'We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shady troll farms to invade our online spaces with their lies about Putin's illegal war. The UK government has alerted international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to undermine Russian information operations.' Linvill said trolls using comments under legitimate accounts was a common disinformation tactic and was not new, adding: 'The IRA has a long history of taking advantage of legitimate voices.' One benefit of a troll posting comments under an account with large numbers of followers is that they do not need many followers themselves to be seen. He said the IRA almost always posted in Russian and the main goal appeared to be influencing Russian public opinion, but the UK government said its latest research suggested Moscow's operation was 'designed to manipulate international public opinion' in favour of its military campaign in Ukraine. TikTok and Twitter have closed scores of accounts in recent months which Linvill believes may be linked to the IRA. He said the impact of TikTok was particularly startling, with some accounts having hundreds of thousands of followers. 'They were very, very effective,' he said. 'They got an incredible amount of traction in the nationalist Russian space.' Twitter said it proactively assesses for inauthentic behaviour and since the start of the war in Ukraine it has removed over 100,000 accounts for violations of its platform manipulation and spam policy. It has labelled or removed 50,000 pieces of content. TikTok and Meta, which operates Facebook and Instagram, have also been approached for comment. Linvill said the IRA's strategy was not to cause people to believe something new, but rather to sow doubt and cause distrust in information sources that are usually seen as legitimate, in particular to deter domestic opposition to the Russian president. 'If you don't believe in anything, you're not going to fight for anything and you are more likely to go along with Putin,' he said.", "e3717c9b8eb8df5b50e7d1765b9fcf6a7663a5b18f01d4b31795bdec": "The House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol will decide 'in the next week or two' whether to issue subpoenas trying to force Republican lawmakers to testify about Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election, one of two Republicans on the panel said on Sunday. 'If that takes a subpoena, it takes a subpoena,' Adam Kinzinger said. The Illinois congressman also told CBS's Face the Nation public hearings planned for June will aim to 'lay the whole story out in front of the American people ... because ultimately, they have to be the judge' of Trump's attempt to hold on to power. Kinzinger and nine other House Republicans voted to impeach Trump over the Capitol attack, which a bipartisan Senate committee linked to seven deaths. But Senate Republicans stayed loyal, acquitting Trump, and Kinzinger is one of four anti-Trump House Republicans who have since announced their retirements. He and Liz Cheney of Wyoming are the only Republicans on the January 6 committee. The June hearings, Kinzinger said, will involve laying out 'what led to January 6, the lies after the election, fundraising, the 187 minutes the president basically sat in the Oval Office [as the Capitol was attacked] ... the response by [the Department of Defense]. 'It's important for us to be able to put that in front of the American people because ultimately, they have to be the judge. The Department of Justice will make decisions based on information but the American people ... have to take the work we've done and decide what they want to do with it or what they want to believe.' Majorities of Republicans in Congress and in public polls believe - or choose to support and repeat - Trump's lie that Biden stole the presidency via electoral fraud. Prominent Trump supporters in Congress who have advanced that lie and were involved in attempts to overturn the election before 6 January have refused to speak to the House committee. 'I won't say who I think we need to talk to yet,' Kinzinger said. 'I mean, I think everybody needs to come and talk to us. We've requested information from various members. 'In terms of whether we move forward with a subpoena, it's going to be both a strategic tactical decision and the question of whether or not we can do that and get the information in time. Decisions we make every day.' Kinzinger added, 'I think ultimately, whatever we can do to get that information. I think if that takes a subpoena, it takes a subpoena. 'But I think the key is, regardless of even what some members of Congress are going to tell us, we know a lot of information ... we're going deeper with richer and more detail to show the American people.' Kinzinger said he would 'love to see' Mike Pence, Trump's vice-president who ultimately refused to reject electoral college results on 6 January, testify before the committee. 'I hope he would do so voluntarily,' he said. 'These are decisions I think that we're going to end up making from a tactical perspective in the next week or two, because we basically pinned down what this hearing schedule is going to look like, the content. 'And as we go into the full narrative of this thing. I would hope and think that the vice-president would want to come in and tell this story, because he did do the right thing on that day. If he doesn't, we have to look at the options we have available to us if there's information we don't already have.' A lawyer for Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a far-right Republican congresswoman shown in court filings by the committee to have been in contact with the White House around 6 January, has claimed she was in fact a victim of the riot. 'I'd love to ask her a few questions,' Kinzinger said. 'We know some things. I won't confirm or deny the text messages of course, but let me just say this. 'For Marjorie Taylor Greene to say she's a victim, it's amazing ... I mean, she assaulted I think a survivor ... from a school shooting at some point in DC. She stood outside a congresswoman's office and yelled through a mail slot and said [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] was too scared to come out and confront her. 'And then when Marjorie Taylor Greene is confronted she's all of a sudden a victim and a poor helpless congresswoman that's just trying to do a job? That's insane.

The demonstration, described as lively and initially peaceful, was aimed at reconquering the night for women, lesbians, intersex and transgender people, according to the organisers. Accompanied by a large police presence, it concentrated on the northern and central Prenzlauerberg and Mitte districts of Berlin. But police intervened to stop the march after some participants set fire to coloured flares and bottles were thrown. Later in the evening, protesters apparently acting independently of organisers threw paint at shop windows and several panes of glass were broken, leading to three arrests. Charges were brought for breaching the peace, violent assault, bodily harm and criminal damage, police spokesperson Anja Dierschke told broadcaster rbb24. Walpurgisnacht is an event in German folklore when witches meet to hold revels with the devil, traditionally in the region of north central Germany on the Brocken mountain. Tens of thousands of others took to the streets elsewhere across the country too, drawing attention to a wide range of issues dominated by the war in Ukraine, the rising cost of living, workers' rights, rental controls and plans to invest heavily in the German military. A separate demonstration around an election campaign event in the northern state of Schleswig Holstein saw foreign minister Annalena Baerbock face accusations of warmongering for her support of providing arms to Ukraine. A later event in the day in which she was due to participate had to be called off after protesters sprayed the stage with butyric acid. Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking to a May Day rally in Dusseldorf, said he respected the values of pacifists but defended his decision to send arms to Ukraine, and said that equipment and aid would keep on coming to the country. He said with a looming food crisis expected to hit Africa in particular, because of wheat and other basic food supplies unable to be shipped from Ukraine, he pledged Germany's support to help countries in need. 'I respect all pacifism, I respect all values,' said Scholz. 'But it would be cynical to tell a citizen of Ukraine he must defend himself against Putin's aggression if he has no weapons.'. Frank Werneke, leader of Europe's largest trade union, Verdi, speaking at a rally in Mainz, warned against a new arms race following Scholz's recent announcement that he would provide EUR100bn (PS84bn) to update Germany's military. Werneke said the injection of such large amounts of money also from the United States and elsewhere, was in danger of disadvantaging poorer sections of society in particular. 'What we don't want is a new arms race that comes at the expense of badly needed investments in social welfare, education and climate protection,' he said. In Dortmund police intervened to break up protests involving leftwing demonstrators. But a spokesperson for the anti-fascist group Autonome Antifa 170 accused police of violence and said several of its members had been injured.

Confirming reports that have swirled in recent days, Qantas announced its mega order with European plane manufacturer Airbus for 12 of its A350-1000 aircraft. These will be run on the so-called 'Project Sunrise' flights, with the first to be delivered in 2025. The airline says the planes will be 'capable of flying direct from Australia to any other city' in the world, while being 25% more fuel-efficient than previous aircraft. The wide-body planes will be able to carry 238 passengers - about 100 fewer seats than competitors flying the A350 - and will feature 'wellbeing zones' for passengers to move about in the cabin as a way to break up the ultra-long-haul flights that will reach up to 20 hours. Chief executive Alan Joyce said Project Sunrise is 'the last frontier and the final fix for the tyranny of distance' and that the cabin of the A350s 'is being specially designed for maximum comfort in all classes for long-haul flying'. The airline has planned the project for years, with the pandemic delaying its launch. The projected 20 hour Sydney to London service would become the longest commercial flight in the world. Despite Qantas' claim that the non-stop flights and new aircraft will bring 'major improvements in emissions', experts say the benefits will be negligible. Currently, an average return trip from Sydney to London with a stop in Singapore generates about 3500kg of CO2 emissions per passenger, according to estimates based on Atmosfair data. Dr Tony Webber, a former chief economist at Qantas who now leads the Airline Intelligence Research group and works at the University of New South Wales' aviation school, said that ultra long haul flights 'are normally not very fuel-efficient at all'. 'It's true that reducing four movements - a take off and landing for each leg - means less fuel is burned, but for a plane to stay in the air for 20 hours without refuelling means they are carrying an enormous amount of fuel. 'That extra fuel is extra weight, which in turn means you've got to burn more fuel overall to carry it. It's a real inefficiency compared with flights that can carry less and refuel at a stop over,' Webber said. Webber said that the need to carry so much fuel would create payload restrictions, meaning the aircraft could tolerate less freight and passengers. Conversely, these weight restrictions could lead Qantas to opt for a more spacious seat configuration in its A350s, Webber said, as it can't maximise the number of seats in line with available cabin space. Qantas has already said more than 40% of the cabin on its A350s will be 'dedicated to premium seating', in addition to its 'wellbeing zones'. 'Being confined to a small space, especially an economy seat, for 18 hours or more is torture,' said Webber. 'Personal space will have to be increased, as well as space for pilots and crew to rest.' While Qantas has not yet released costs for the ultra long haul flights, Webber predicted that at the very minimum, non-stop routes would be $300 more expensive per leg, and increase in line with how much time the route saves the passenger. Professor Bruce Thompson, head of Melbourne University's School of Health Sciences, cautioned that the negative effects of repeated long haul flying on pilot and crew members' circadian rhythms would be more pronounced on the longer flights. In addition to deep vein thrombosis risk for those in tight economy seats, Thompson said there could be mental health implications that become more pronounced in the final few hours of the 20 hour long services. 'The airlines need to consider comfort and safety onboard these flights. They'll need multiple sets of crews just to staff them, and you need pilots alert especially at landing,' he said. Ultimately, Thompson said not enough research had been done to definitively know the safety of flying non-stop for 20 hours. Previous studies commissioned by Qantas on the passenger experience of long haul flying drew suggestions for exercise bikes and virtual reality technology onboard. Transport Workers Union national secretary Michael Kaine was critical of Qantas' spending on new aircraft after thousands of employees lost their jobs during the pandemic. Qantas received about $2bn in government Covid wage supports, and separately, the airline was found to have illegally outsourced 2,000 ground handling jobs. 'While many illegally outsourced workers are still struggling to make ends meet and passengers are suffering long delays and lost luggage, we see Qantas splashing the cash on new planes and flight routes,' Kaine said. Qantas has also ordered an additional 40 Airbus aircraft - A321XLRs and A220-300s - for domestic operations, with the first of these aircraft to be delivered next year. The deal is understood to be valued in the billions of dollars. While the airline says the exact cost of the new planes is commercial-in-confidence, it said 'a significant discount from the standard price should be assumed'. Analysts at Barrenjoey estimated in a client note the entire order could cost at least $6 billion, Reuters reported. On the orders to refresh its domestic fleet, Joyce said the range and economics of the new planes Qantas had ordered 'will make new direct routes possible, including serving regional cities better' and that 'these newer aircraft and engines will reduce emissions by at least 15% if running on fossil fuels, and significantly better when run on sustainable aviation fuel'. Meanwhile, Qantas Group - which includes budget carrier Jetstar - also released its third quarter financial update on Monday. While the resurgence of domestic and some international travel markets has boosted revenue, the airline still expects to post 'a significant' full-year loss. Net debt has reduced from $5.5bn at the end of December to $4.5bn by the end of April. In 2017, Qantas launched non-stop service from Perth to London, and now flies the from Darwin to London.", "d6326195597bf185382a401cc3435941d8631f5604efc8d38e6710d8": "Maori songs, tearful embraces and a beloved New Zealand chocolate bar awaited international visitors arriving in New Zealand on Monday - the first foreign guests, other than Australians, to set foot in Aotearoa in more than two years. Since March 2020, the arrival terminals at New Zealand's international airports have been desolate as the country swiftly closed the border to prevent the arrival of Covid-19.  On Monday morning, the border reopened to vaccinated visitors from about 60 visa-waiver countries as part of the government's phased reopening plan. The first travellers and returning New Zealanders touched down just after 6am at Auckland international airport from Los Angeles, with another flight from San Francisco arriving shortly after. Garth and Chris Halliday cried as their son Stephen arrived with his wife and son, who they hadn't seen in over a year, the news website Stuff reported. Garth said the tearful airport scenes were reminiscent of those in the film Love Actually, while Stephen said it was 'emotional' to be home. An American tourist told RNZ through tears they had wanted to visit New Zealand for many years. 'I'm finally here. It's amazing,' they said. Vaccinated international visitors can enter New Zealand if they have had a negative pre-departure Covid test. On arrival, they must self-test for coronavirus, and unless it comes back positive there is no requirement quarantine or self-isolate. All other international visitors will be allowed to enter New Zealand from October, unless the government decides it is safe to do so earlier. The tourism minister, Stuart Nash, who greeted arrivals at the gate with a Whittaker's Peanut Slab chocolate bar, told 1News the reunions 'almost bring a tear to the eye'. 'People haven't seen each other for a long, long time - family and friends,' he said. 'We have also, of course, got international business people [who] are able to reconnect and they are coming back.' Nash said that while the country is not yet quite back to normal, the reopening was another step towards it. 'This has been a long time [coming] - this sends a signal we are now open for business ... it is fantastic to see,' Nash said. 'Today marks a milestone for visitors from our key northern hemisphere markets in the USA, UK, Germany, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Canada and others, who can now jump on a plane to come here.' More than 30,000 people are arriving into the country each week - an increase on numbers throughout the pandemic, but well below pre-Covid levels, which were close to 25,000 people each day. Nash said international flight searches to New Zealand were running 19% higher than in pre-Covid times. Auckland airport's chief executive Carrie Hurihanganui said 9,000 passengers would be arriving and departing on 43 international flights on Monday - three times the number in March. The airport has boosted its staff by 40 people, and will continue to do so in the coming months, she said. Hurihanganui said the reunions were giving her 'goosebump moments'. 'It's been a pleasure to be here today, and the fact we can play a role in welcoming people back to Aotearoa is fantastic,' she told 1News outside the arrivals gate.", "8933c7b09d660891384e670eda3a5907ea142eaf8250925721fcd3fd": "The Arkansas governor, Asa Hutchinson, is considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 and would not be deterred if Donald Trump made an expected bid to return to the White House.

I think we ought to have a different direction in the future and so I'm not aligned with [Trump] on some of his endorsements, but also the direction he wants to take our country. 'I think he did a lot of good things for our country, but we need to go a different direction and so that's not a factor in my decision-making process.' Trump is free to run - and has amassed huge campaign funding - after being acquitted in his second Senate impeachment trial, in which he was charged with inciting the deadly January 6 Capitol attack, in his attempt to overturn defeat by Joe Biden. More than 20 years ago, Hutchinson was a House impeachment manager in the trial of Bill Clinton, over the 42nd president's affair with Monica Lewinsky. As Arkansas governor, Hutchinson now operates in the more moderate lane of Republican politics. On CNN, he was asked about an appearance last week at a 'Politics & Eggs' event in New Hampshire, a 'traditional stop for any presidential hopeful' in an early voting state. 'You've got to get through course this year,' he said, 'but that's an option that's on the table. And that's one of the reasons I was in New Hampshire.' Hutchinson used his CNN interview to take a shot at Ron DeSantis, another potential candidate in 2024, regarding the Florida governor's battle with Disney over his anti-LGBTQ+ schools policy.  The Arkansas governor was also asked if he would support Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader and an ardent Trump ally, to become speaker if Republicans take control in November. He said: 'Well, of course, you know, Speaker McCarthy, or excuse me, Majority Leader McCarthy has his own set of challenges within the caucus. And he's got to be able to somehow bring that together.' McCarthy was recently shown to have said Trump should resign in the aftermath of the Capitol attack, to have changed his tune to support the former president, and to have lied about what he told his party. Hutchinson told CNN: 'I would say that we had one message after January 6 among many of our leaders, recognising the problem with the insurrection. And that tone has changed and I believe that that's an error. 'I don't think we can diminish what happened on January 6. We're going to be having hearings there in Congress and much of this will come out in public in June, and that's not going to be helpful for those that diminish the significance of that event. 'And so that worries me in terms of not just the majority leader but also worries me in terms of other leaders that have diminished what happened on January 6.'", "d83ad0e64b71727f363074795c9cdc46ca4cb13111de690757677c1c": "Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has fallen victim to cutbacks at Netflix, according to a US report that said the struggling streaming giant has dropped plans for her animated series Pearl. Announced to fanfare last summer, with Meghan as its creator and executive producer, the 'family series' was to have focused on the adventures of a 12-year-old girl inspired by historically influential female figures. It was to have been the first animated production under Meghan and her husband Prince Harry's Archewell brand, which was created in 2020 as a vehicle for their new careers in the US, following their separation from the British royal family. Netflix, once dominant among streaming platforms but now wrestling with slumping subscriber numbers and a collapse in share value, dropped the project amid a wave of cutbacks, according to Deadline. Referring to the decision unflatteringly as 'a royal flush', the entertainment industry website said the project Meghan was co-executive-producing with David Furnish, who is married to Elton John, was axed in the development stage. 'Word in town is that even before recent events, Netflix had been telling producers to take some development projects elsewhere,' the report said. 'Clearly, Netflix's inordinately high content spend is being re-evaluated. It is just unreasonable to expect its execs to manage that many projects, and have enough of them turn out to be memorable.' Netflix did not immediately comment. There was also no immediate reaction from Archewell, leaving it unclear if the company would continue production on Pearl or attempt to move it elsewhere. Other Archewell projects with Netflix, including the documentary series Heart of Invictus, about Harry's Olympics-style Invictus Games for disabled former service members, are believed to be unaffected. The former working royals, who live in Montecito, California, signed a multi-year deal with Netflix in September last year. Netflix has dropped two animated series not produced by Archewell, Dino Daycare and Boons and Curses, according to the Hollywood Reporter. In publicity material for the announcement of Pearl last summer, Meghan said she was excited. 'Like many girls her age, our heroine Pearl is on a journey of self-discovery as she tries to overcome life's daily challenges,' she said. 'I'm thrilled that Archewell Productions, partnered with the powerhouse platform of Netflix and these incredible producers, will together bring you this new animated series, which celebrates extraordinary women throughout history. 'David Furnish and I have been eager to bring this special series to light.'", "d7da42ed6d24663b062ded1951d5553d2eeb1343b1417ecc3c883630": "", "f43da7ec1007722b15d937382dc3fff0b31e6c11359d5426baadce20": "Untreated sewage was discharged into England's coastal bathing waters for more than 160,000 hours last year, according to figures collated by the Liberal Democrats to mark the start of the summer sea-swimming season. Data compiled by the party using Environment Agency figures on 2021 discharges shows that water companies released raw sewage 25,000 times into designated bathing waters off the English coast. Figures collated by the campaign group Top of the Poops reveal that when also including the bathing waters in Wales, water companies released untreated sewage for 217,804 hours. The bathing water designations - which were created by the EU - are supposed to highlight the country's cleanest and safest waters for the public. The quality of the water is publicly identified on signs at the bathing beaches, ranging from excellent to poor. The longest discharges into bathing waters were carried out by United Utilities, which released untreated sewage into sea-swimming spots in its area for almost 75,000 hours. The company's worst-hit bathing water site was Morecambe South beach. A United Utilities spokesperson told the Guardian that the area has seen billions of pounds of water company investment over the last 30 years meaning that bathing waters are now cleaner than they have ever been. 'Across the region, 93% of bathing waters were classified as Good or Excellent in 2021 and all met the designated minimum standards.  'We are already committed to a programme of action for further improvements, building on this environmental achievement, and we are spending PS230m over the next three years to reduce the impact of storm overflows.'  Southern Water, which was last year fined a record PS90m for spilling billions of litres of raw sewage into Hampshire and Kent coastal waters, was responsible for 20,367 hours of untreated sewage discharges into designated bathing spots off the coast in their area. South West Water discharged sewage into bathing beauty spots for 43,901 hours, with their longest discharge released at Ilfracombe's Wildersmouth Beach, lasting 1,833 hours. The figures were released as the official sea-swimming season opened on Sunday. This marks the start of annual monitoring of bathing-water quality, which helps to inform the public about the water at beaches they visit. The season lasts until September. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrats rural affairs spokesperson, said: 'It is now or never to save families from swimming in sewage-infested waters this summer. 'Children should be free to enjoy Britain's great coastlines and lakes, yet Conservative ministers are letting water companies get away with shameful sewage dumps. This is an environmental scandal.' The data was released as many parts of the UK prepare to go to the polls on Thursday to vote in local elections. The Liberal Democrats have called for a sewage tax on water companies' profits to be used to clean up coastlines, rivers and lakes. Environment Agency data shows that in 2021 water companies released raw sewage into all coastal waters and rivers in England for more than 2.7m hours. The Lib Dems said that in the same year the firms made PS2.8bn in operating profits and paid out PS27m in bonuses to senior executives. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of the campaigning charity Surfers Against Sewage, said: 'Water companies are getting away with blue murder - repeatedly dumping raw sewage into areas of special recreational interest, with seeming impunity. 'Our great beach-loving public shouldn't have to swim or surf the gauntlet 0f sewage, pathogens and pharmaceuticals that are pumped out through water company pipes. Surfers Against Sewage has been challenging the water industry for decades, calling for them to put people and planet before excessive profits and executive bonuses. We demand a new decade of ambition to clean up and protect all our bathing waters and blue spaces.'  This article was amended on 2 May 2022 to include a comment from United Utilities.

'There will be a fight over pensions, that's clear - battle has been declared,' said the leftwing CGT trade union in Toulouse. Trade unionists, environmentalists and parties on the left, as well as yellow-vest anti-government protesters, marched in cities across the country - on what is also known as fete du Travail (Labour Day) in France - demanding a rise in pensions and salaries and an end to Macron's plan to gradually raise the pension age to 65. The government said that 45 arrests were made on the edge of the peaceful march in Paris, after a small group of people dressed in black, described as 'black bloc' anarchists, smashed the windows of businesses, including a McDonald's, and attacked cash dispensers while setting bins alight. Police fired teargas and one woman was arrested for attacking a firefighter as he put out a fire. Eight police officers were injured. The centrist Macron, who was reelected last weekend with 58.5% of the vote against the far-right Marine Le Pen, is under pressure to govern differently in his second-term -- with less top-down decision-making and a more participative, decentralised approach, in which citizens would have more input. 'This is a very political May Day, where workers intend to weigh heavily on all the big issues,' said Benoit Teste, head of the FSU teachers' union. 'It's a crucial moment to feel the mood on the ground and set the tone.' 'I want to calm things,' Macron had told locals in a walkabout in south-west France on Friday, after vowing to take into account everyone who voted for him, including those on the left who chose him only to keep out Le Pen. But no details have filtered out on how Macron would consult with citizens or whether he will undertake a reform of France's political system, including introducing an element of proportional representation in parliament. With his second term beginning officially on 14 May, Macron is currently deliberating over who to appoint as the new prime minister who will have expanded powers on overseeing French environmental policy. Some have hoped it would be a woman with a background on the left. Macron has spent recent days still in campaign mode, wading into crowds in town squares in order to listen to voters' concerns, sometimes for hours at a time, to counter his image as haughty and aloof and to show he has understood the current cost-of-living crisis, which is voters' number one concern. This is seen as crucial if he is to secure a broad centrist majority in the parliamentary elections in June that would give him a free hand to implement his policies of overhauling the welfare state and pensions system. The parliament vote has been seized upon by both the far-right Le Pen and the radical-left's Jean-Luc Melenchon, who are seeking to greatly increase their seats in a France where voters are divided and disappointed with politics. 'What we have seen is an extremely strong break between the base of the social pyramid - those who don't have riches nor power nor influence - and the so-called summit,' said Francois Bayrou, the head of the centrist party MoDem, and a key Macron ally, during the campaign. 'There must be a new government approach, which must be constantly in consideration of the French people.' Sylvain Burquier was one of 150 people randomly selected to take part in a citizens' assembly to develop methods for cutting carbon emissions during Macron's first term. Environmentalists criticised the government for not going far enough to follow the citizens' recommendations. But Burquier said the method itself, of forming an assembly of everyday people to thrash out difficult public policy issues, had proved that it worked and should be expanded. 'The 150 of us are convinced that new forms of participative or deliberative democracy can move issues forward,' Burquier said. 'By being a middle path - neither activists nor businesses - we shook things up ... The population was behind us, we're still active today, we upset a lot of people because we were totally transpartisan, and only linked by the common good, not at all by political posturing ... It's a new transversal way of doing things that upsets the status quo and when that happens, things move forward.' Macron has promised his second term would be devoted to tackling the climate emergency, after admitting environmental policy must be speeded up. But an Elabe poll after Macron's presidential win on 24 April found 57% of people didn't believe he would make the environment his top priority. A key policy task in the short term is to address the cost of living crisis. Macron is expected to renew caps on energy costs and consider further anti-inflation payments to low-income households this summer. Ultimately, Macron has promised to get France to full unemployment. The unemployment rate dropped to its lowest in 13 years during Macron's first term, and its economy - the world's seventh largest - outperformed other big European countries as well as the broader euro currency zone. But with inflation in France reaching a new high of 5.4% in April, while growth stalled in the first quarter, May Day marchers warned that people were angry at the struggle to make ends meet, calling for salaries to be increased and pensions to be raised. Trade unions at the demonstrations said Macron's new plans to raise the retirement age could lead to strike action. During Macron's first term, a different proposed pensions overhaul sparked protests that lasted longer than any strike since the wildcat workers' stoppages of 1968, and the reform was shelved during the pandemic. 'If there's a need to, we'll strike,' the secretary general of the Force Ouvriere trade union told BFMTV at the Paris demonstration. 'Let that be heard. We have our reasons. It's not just pure obstruction, it's based on an economic and social argument.' May Day protests were held in various countries across Europe:", "0143995c58e36b84f8548bdc520054f15992c84a8f039c21540e5091": "Jacob Zuma has been accused of systematic and 'unlawful' efforts to give business allies control of billions of dollars worth of state assets, by the judge charged with investigating wrongdoing during the former president's years in power in South Africa. Raymond Zondo, who was appointed in 2018 to lead an inquiry into allegations of systematic corruption under Zuma's rule, handed his latest report to the current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, on Friday. The 1,000-page document accuses businessmen brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta of being the beneficiaries of Zuma's efforts to fire competent officials, intervene in management decisions, appoint compliant ministers and influence the award of contracts worth huge sums. Zondo said that the Guptas, who came to South Africa from India in the 1990s and built a sprawling commercial empire, had identified Zuma as someone 'whose character was such that [the Guptas] could use him against the people of South Africa, his own country and his own government to advance their own business interests'. Zuma won power in 2009. A populist who was expected to reconnect the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party to increasingly disillusioned voters, he was forced out nine years later amid growing public anger at economic failures and a series of graft scandals. He is on medical parole while serving a 15-month prison sentence after his conviction last year of contempt of court for defying a constitutional court order to testify before Zondo's inquiry. Zuma was jailed for contempt in July last year, a move which set off days of rioting in the KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces in which shops, warehouses and factories were looted and many burned. More than 300 people died in the unrest, the worst in South Africa since the end of the repressive, racist apartheid regime in 1994. ANC officials loyal to Ramaphosa described the violence as 'political sabotage' and a potential attempt at a coup d'etat. After three months behind bars, the 79-year-old politician was released on medical parole for an undisclosed health condition. A subsequent court judgment ruled the medical parole was invalid, but his lawyers are appealing that judgment. Zuma and the Gupta brothers, who left South Africa after Zuma's fall from power and are believed to be in Dubai, deny wrongdoing. They have previously said the allegations against them are politically motivated. The commission has interviewed hundreds of witnesses, viewed tens of thousands of files and obtained phone records among other evidence. The latest report also found that ministers and other officials knew of alleged efforts to steal vast sums from Eskom, the state power utility. Other scandals involve the national airline, which no longer flies, and a series of other state-owned companies. The charges of wrongdoing related to Eskom are particularly sensitive in South Africa, and will cause new problems for the ANC party, in power for 28 years. Chronic lack of maintenance, underinvestment and management failures have left Eskom unable to supply sufficient power to South Africa, resulting in frequent nationwide power cuts that have cut economic growth and hampered recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. In the report, Zondo asked why the ANC government had not acted to prevent the alleged corruption. 'Were they aware of everything but lacked the courage to stop President Zuma and his friends, the Guptas, in what they were doing? Were they looking the other way?' the judge wrote. 'The ANC and the ANC government should be ashamed that this happened under their watch.' Ramaphosa was deputy president from 2014 but the report will harm his enemies and rivals within the ANC more than it damages his own reputation. Analysts say the former union leader and business tycoon has a good chance of winning a second term at polls in 2024. A separate corruption trial of Zuma has been postponed again on Monday pending the outcome of the former leader's appeal to get the state prosecutor removed from his case. The delay is the latest of many as it has been nearly 17 years since Zuma was first charged with corruption, fraud and money laundering related to South Africa's controversial 1999 arms deal. He is charged alongside French arms manufacturer Thales, which is accused of paying bribes to Zuma through his former financial adviser Schabir Shaik, who was convicted on corruption charges in 2005. South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority has accused Zuma of delaying tactics to prevent the start of the trial. While Zuma has publicly said he wants his day in court, he has over the years launched numerous legal actions that have delayed the start of the trial.", "20c8b4d92e2c7c106e50aeef705547b303cb9750b0854aada0c444f4": "", "acdd99aed4fc9dd595198b4d3e2767772103035d08306f850f5b5fb8": "", "d8a3acb518538a634a027f76ad811cd4063e552607a5a4fc161daf25": "", "9576cbd237c5326bbeb425199128354a8b4a12376540786652790c70": "", "fa2a40f5c8137a2ed4b7f4ab2bc19610783f976716c5255968108717": "", "590153254223ca100e6b9141e054dd98794a838512530f342a15827b": "Garmin's latest rugged solar-powered smartwatch, the Instinct 2, promises unlimited battery life. You just have to stay in the sun. Looking more like a rugged digital watch such as Casio's legendary G-Shock than an Apple or Samsung smartwatch, the Garmin feels made to take a beating with its monochrome screen, physical buttons and sturdy body. It costs from PS299.99 ($349.99/A$549) and comes in various versions such as one for surfing and even one for professional truck drivers. But it is the solar charging models, costing PS389.99, that promise never to need to be plugged in for power. Underneath the rugged exterior is Garmin's smartwatch tech, featuring market-leading sport, health and location-tracking. It has smartphone connectivity for notifications, alerts and syncing your data via the Connect app on an Android or iPhone. It is very similar to many other Garmin sport watches, but what sets the Instinct 2 apart is its promise of incredible battery life even without the power of the sun. The standard 45mm model without solar will last up to 28 days used as a general smartwatch, which is 10 days longer than the already impressive Fenix 7 and about 14 times longer than an Apple Watch. The solar version, which charges using a transparent 'power glass' covering the screen and panels around the edge of the display, promises to keep the battery topped up for essentially unlimited battery life as long as you spend at least three hours in direct sunlight (50,000 lux of light). How realistic that is depends on your day-to-day activities. On a sunny winter's day in London the watch received 40,000 lux of direct sunlight through a window, so if you spend your days outside rather than locked in an office it seems more than feasible. For mainly indoor usage during winter without much in the way of solar charging, the watch lasted about 15 days between charges, including five hours of workout-tracking. I wore it 24 hours a day with message alerts, heart rate, stress, calories, general activity and health monitoring, plus sleep and blood oxygen (SpO2) tracking overnight. Turning off the Sp02 sensor added days to the life as did limiting workouts. The solar charging would add at least 24 hours battery for each sunny spring day spent outside, too. Of course its battery prowess comes at the cost of features on fancier-looking Garmin watches such as the Fenix 7 or rivals like the Apple Watch. The Instinct 2 lacks a touchscreen, though the button-based interface is fast and logical. It lacks the new high-accuracy multi-band GPS tracking technology, but still has an altimeter, barometer and compass. The biggest missing features are offline music playback, such as Spotify without having to use your phone, and offline maps. It can plot breadcrumb trails of where you have been on an activity to help you get back to the start, guide you in the direction of points of interest and even measure the area of a space by walking its perimeter, but it has no maps available. The watch tracks a vast number of activities including various forms of running, walking, cycling, swimming, strength, cardio, Hiit and more exotic ones such as paddle boarding, hunting, fishing, backcountry skiing and bouldering. Some activities are restricted to special versions of the watch, such as the jumpmaster mode for skydiving being only available on the 'tactical edition', surfing and tide information on the 'surf edition' and the truck-driver tools on the 'dezl edition' to plan breaks and workouts. Only the solar models have Garmin Pay for contactless payments too, which supports few UK banks but is useful in emergencies when out on excursions without a credit card or phone. On the health front, it has Garmin's excellent body battery, which makes it easy to understand the impact of sleep, activity and rest on your day, plus stress tracking, abnormal heart rate alerts, daily workout suggestions, Vo2 Max fitness measurement and recovery estimation after exercise and many other features. All the activity and health information the watch collects is sent via Bluetooth to the excellent Garmin Connect app on your phone, within which you can pore over mountains of data, graphs and insights. Plus you can connect it straight to social networks such as Strava. The Garmin Instinct 2 comes in two sizes and various models, starting at PS299.99 ($349.99/A$549) for the standard version or PS389.99 ($449.99/A$699) with solar charging. For comparison, the Garmin Forerunner 55 costs PS149.99, Venu 2 costs from PS349.99, Fenix 7 costs from PS599.99, Epix costs from PS799.99, the Coros Apex costs PS299.99 and the Polar Grit X costs PS369. The Instinct 2 Solar is the closest model so far to what is the holy grail of smartwatch makers - a watch which you never have to plug into the charger. It looks and feels more like a traditional digital watch, but is backed by Garmin's comprehensive activity and general health tracking, and simple smartphone notifications. It lacks a few bells and whistles you get with less rugged smartwatch rivals, such as voice assistants, maps, offline music or ECG (heart rhythm) measurement, but its features will probably be more than enough for those not looking for an Apple Watch or similar. If you spend long enough each day in the sun or bright environments you may never need to charge it. For those of us more often confined to the indoors, it'll still last close to a month or longer with some less necessary features disabled. The Instinct 2 is expensive and certainly not for everyone, but if you're an outdoors person or looking for a smarter health-tracking version of a digital watch, the Garmin is great.", "1bbe2fb5e20415ae5d806dd022535565b725d3f7e86c527a64b8d714": "", "6fee027bce6905d317e8d7816f402082f7c33355e7a198a12e5423b5": "", "d402e37b1f37113a80b0ebb4c46a5d9de636986d738d1f1b3616b8e2": "", "5761d25be1eb92a27d4991d3e154ecbe80548b97ef8f4a84b0b7cd06": "", "018bfb5dd8821cbf5a8319b5ad8790197da472392acf68d4889f0945": "", "4ea10fd035ec73f32035b0063b03a69d19de9f983353643a1f39434f": "", "ecc21c4519b20c66b7f2cf85fb8fd279e3da8e29232ff83afeec4533": "", "b095aef66fd4d13217d79c848892b01491311284da0b325ed9b5a222": "", "4ddb5f93b8dc1f71c4714075c2ffdbd6ce8d1904fbe2b46b9897292c": "", "4b6571954b640c47c2ae30d432fae13200d8c196dd70040cebea0ebf": "", "52581a65a8cb4f2f39f9b8a7e6336161b6d924090ad0703ed8c69b1c": "", "3cce600f1c021be63fcc501336186af73ced6cea8dd7e789c7b8221d": "", "8e3e0e437202551932966655001e72890fbf6bc5ff72bc9d5f33ca63": "", "2c56a5651b602186947d4eaf11a08abdbe77ab0d540d85d2d018d580": "", "b252c9c562f11791904ebcca2a96b8ed5c9dad896c09b37bf3d9fa61": "", "e5451a3d85ac1acfec3eaf45149a125d6e186c0dddc10bbf897a8f0d": "An aggressive draft campaign by the Russian-backed separatists who control parts of eastern Ukraine has emptied the area's streets of military-age men, with many in hiding to avoid being sent to the frontline. In a sign of how desperate pro-Russia authorities are to bolster the ranks of fighters, in late March they announced that the upper age limit of the draft had been raised from 55 to 65 in Donetsk, local media reported. And on Saturday authorities announced a mobilisation in the region of Kherson, which was largely captured by Russia after the war began. Men who do not want to become cannon fodder in a war they do not support, against a country - Ukraine - that most of them still consider their own, are spending their days in hiding. Locals joke that they now live in a town of Amazons, run by women. Husbands, sons and brothers live in basements or locked indoors. They cannot stay in their own homes because registration is by address. Instead they stay at the homes of friends or relatives where no military-age men are listed as residents. Some come out at night, when the patrols rounding up unwilling recruits pause or are less frequent. 'When I walk my dog at 11pm I could see the silhouettes of men smoking behind the curtains, with a window open,' said one resident reached by phone, who like most in Donetsk did not want to be quoted by name. By day their jobs have been taken over by wives, sisters or female friends, or have simply gone unfilled. It is almost impossible to get a car repaired because most of the city's mechanics are men who would be covered by the draft, locals said. 'It usually takes 45 minute to fix a problem with my tyres, and I just grab a coffee nearby,' said one woman. 'But last time I was asked to drop my car and leave it over the weekend so that they could bring a guy to fix it at night.' Electronics shops in the market that used to be staffed by men are now run by female relatives, who put the usual owners on the line to handle any questions. 'You discuss all the technical details with him and then she will just give you what you wanted and take your money,' said one man who escaped the draft because of a medical condition and a foreign passport. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, the so-called separatist region backed and recognised by Russia, announced its draft on 19 February, a few days before the invasion of the rest of Ukraine. Exemptions have to be signed off by senior government officials, who themselves are one of the few groups to be spared the draft. The order went out extremely early to try to prevent the men affected from fleeing, and those caught included some visitors from the Ukrainian-controlled part of the country. 'My son went back to our home village to check on his grandmother two days before the draft was announced. Now he is stuck in the DNR and I am very worried,' said one man in western Ukraine, trying to gather money to fund an escape. 'He is in hiding, and hasn't left the house for two months now. There are ways to smuggle him out, but only to Russia and it is very expensive and risky.' In interviews with residents of the region, the Guardian heard of only two men granted leave to stay in their jobs. One was an anaesthesiologist, allowed to stay at his post when other doctors were ordered to join the military because he was one of just two experts left in the city. The other was a driver trained in using complicated construction equipment. Bribes work but the cost of draft-dodging is $800, an exorbitant amount for most people in an already poor area with an economy now crippled by the war. Men pushing the top end of the draft age group have grown beards in an attempt to look older, although the raising of the upper limit to 65 means grey hair alone offers little protection. In a further sign of desperation, city authorities have twice tried to lure men out of hiding by claiming the draft was finishing. Documents purporting to be government leaks about a new policy were shared on Telegram channels, but then men who came out of hiding because of them were seized and drafted. Locals now say they will not believe any more news of the draft being cancelled. 'Two times the authorities have tried to fool us by posting info that draft is over. So the next morning men started going out and they were all taken,' said another resident. 'Now everyone learned the lesson so if they will announce that draft is over no one will believe them.'", "3d7ce99876e2f75acf6cd25c21de1e60d38391581838e9ae0b91112a": "Off the west coast of Sicily lies the remains of the ancient city of Motya. There, a compound of temples and shrines offers a window into the life of Phoenician settlers who journeyed from Lebanon across the Mediterranean in the first millennium BC. While Motya has been studied for a century, the site is still giving up new secrets. Earlier this month a rectangular basin, long-believed to have served as an artificial harbour for protecting naval ships and participating in trade, was revealed to be something else entirely - a religious site, designed and constructed to perfectly align with the stars. The basin, larger than an Olympic-sized swimming pool, was rebuilt in 550BC along with Motya after it was destroyed in an attack by Carthage, another Phoenician colony across the sea in Tunisia. The city was then abandoned in Roman times.  Since the pool's discovery in the 1920s, it was thought to be a 'kothon' - an artificial military harbour. Kothon are quite common in the Mediterranean, says Ania Kotarba, a senior lecturer in archaeology at Flinders University. The most famous is in Carthage. But recent excavations and decades of research led by the archaeologist Lorenzo Nigro of Sapienza University of Rome and published in the journal Antiquity this month unearthed clues suggesting instead the pool is the heart of a sprawling religious site. 'Sacred pools are less common [than kothon],' Kotarba says. 'So one on such a scale is quite impressive.' Since his team's research, perceptions of the basin have 'drastically changed,' says Nigro in a statement. What was thought to be a harbour for centuries may soon be interpreted as 'a sacred pool at the centre of one of the largest cultic complexes of the pre-classical Mediterranean'. Reinvestigation of the basin began 12 years ago, when remains of a temple to the god Ba'al were discovered where excavators expected to find harbour buildings. Ba'al - a widely used Semitic word meaning 'lord' - has often been likened to the Greek god Orion, who was believed to exist as a constellation among the stars. Kotarba says Ba'al was associated with the god of storms in the Phoenician period. As Phoenicians were known to be seafarers, traders and explorers, their deities were associated with celestial bodies. 'Their livelihoods were connected to celestial movements around the sky,' she says. 'Storms are the greatest adversary to seafarers, and the god of storms could interrupt their safe passages. 'So it is not unexpected that their key sanctuary would be dedicated to Ba'al, and have something to do with astronomy working out movement of celestial bodies,' Kotarba says. A 10ft statue of Ba'al once stood at the pool's centre. Its torso was discovered in the 1930s in a nearby lagoon, and stone blocks used for its feet were found by the pool's edge.  Quoting Leonardo da Vinci, Nigro says; 'the only good mirror in antiquity is water. 'It became clear the function of the basin was to be a pool for watching the stars, reflecting them like a mirror,' he says. His research found the water's reflection was used as a tool to map movement of the stars for navigation - something crucial to Phoenicians, who Kotarba calls 'the greatest navigators of the Mediterranean and beyond'. Upon mapping the site, the research team also found the configuration of Motya itself aligned with the heavens.  Key features line up with constellations - the temple of Ba'al aligns with the rise of Orion's constellation at the winter solstice. Recent excavations also found several more temples bordering the pool, alongside inscribed stone columns, altars and offerings. Critically, unlike harbours, the pool is not connected to the sea. The draining of the kothon for excavation began in 2005. So, one morning when Nigro arrived to find a small pond of 'beautiful transparent water' in the basin, he 'could not understand how it was possible'. It was not until 2019 that excavation revealed channels carrying water to the pool from three natural springs. Nigro calls discovery of the Phoenician's 'pre-scientific tool' a 'piece of human-kind in the past'. 'We can not use our science to understand this past science,' Nigro told the Guardian. 'But it can teach us there exists a diversity in science. There could be solutions in it for us. The Phoenicians colonised, built up cultures and civilisations. They built roads and crossed seas, but they never destroyed their environment. 'We are the only civilisation destroying the environment,' he says. 'We should ask, are we the ones who have more science, or them?'", "7d4a477a24cbd37215256f4fec1a0ff6ab221db56500f2c0f5d45bf1": "Even by the standards of the plain-speaking Dutch, Sophie in 't Veld is pretty blunt. The European Council - the body of EU leaders - is 'from a democratic point of view, a monster' and 'totally dysfunctional', she says. The European Commission is 'shamelessly protecting' autocratic governments, over enforcing the rule of law. And the European parliament, the veteran MEP thinks, 'is not playing its role within European democracy'.  While EU leaders have applauded the unprecedented speed of EU sanctions against Russia, taboo-breaking decisions to fund lethal weapons for Ukraine and help Ukrainian refugees, in 't Veld thinks the war has only exposed the EU's 'dysfunctional' governance, a complex patchwork of institutions where national governments are ultimately in charge. 'I very much welcome the fact that the European Union is now taking steps [to support Ukraine], that there is more integration; I think that is long overdue, but that also increases the need for a more democratic union,' she told the Guardian. The European Peace Facility, which is funding weapons for Ukraine, she points out, is neither scrutinised by the European parliament, nor national legislatures. Instead, a group of member state officials meet behind closed doors to sign off its annual budget and accounts. In 't Veld supports EU funds to arm Ukraine, but thinks more transparency is needed: 'So we are spending EUR1.5bn [PS1.24bn] without democratic oversight on weapons and I think that's a very good illustration of why we need a drastic and quick reform of the European Union.' Such views don't make her very popular, even in her own group of centrist MEPs. She recounts one colleague 'really shouting at me' for 'attacking' the commission. While in 't Veld supports the EU's Ukraine policy, she doesn't think MEPs should stop asking difficult questions: 'Since when is parliamentary scrutiny considered to be an attack? I think it's an attack on democracy if there is no parliamentary scrutiny.' It is an argument she makes in a recent book, The Scent of Wild Animals, which calls for a radical overhaul of how the EU works. The title was inspired by the late co-founder of her D66 party, Hans Van Mierlo, who spoke admiringly of the animal spirits in the Dutch parliament. In 't Veld would like to see the same cut and thrust in Brussels and Strasbourg: 'The European parliament has to be a true political arena, with the scent of wild animals, blood, sweat and sawdust,' she wrote. Instead, too many MEPs lack a parliamentary spirit, she thinks. This month [April] the European parliament revived 'Question Hour' with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. A process intended to hold the EU executive to account, several MEPs used their slot to make mini speeches and throw in several sprawling questions. It was 'a joke' says in 't Veld. 'There were the kind of questions, where I thought: 'people if this is what you want to know, do a Google search'. This is not a political question'.' The European parliament has three problems, she says: a large number of first-time MEPs, Covid and Brexit. Although MEPs have resumed meetings in Brussels and Strasbourg, much work still happens online. 'People are stuck in their homes looking at a screen and they are much closer to national politics than before,' she said. Then there is Brexit: the European parliament waved goodbye to the UK's 73 MEPs in January 2020. A couple of years on, 'the parliamentary tradition of the UK is sorely lacking' in Brussels, in 't Veld says. The UK provided 'a cohort of people who saw the parliament as a counterweight to the EU's other institutions. Bit by bit I am beginning to realise how important they were for the political culture here'. When the commission was recently found guilty of maladministration by a European watchdog over text messages von der Leyen had exchanged with the chief executive of Pfizer at the height of the pandemic, while negotiating billion-euro vaccine deals, the European parliament did nothing. 'Can you imagine any other leader of the government or the executive doing this and the national parliament being mum? I'm just totally shocked. I don't know what to say,' said in t' Veld. If the European parliament is too weak, in 't Veld believes that EU leaders are too powerful and too unaccountable. She would abolish the European Council, which she describes as 'fundamentally undemocratic' because of its ambiguous role that is neither fully executive nor legislator. That, she admits, will not happen, but instead she would like more transparency about how it makes decisions. It's a view many would challenge. Luuk Van Middelaar, a political theorist and former adviser to the European Council president, has argued the EU showed 'a remarkable dynamism and resilience' in its response to the Covid pandemic, largely as a result of decisions made by EU heads of government. The increased role of the European Council in multiple late-night crisis summits on the eurozone, Brexit, migration and Ukraine, is also said to make the EU more democratic and visible to voters. In 't Veld disagrees: 'Yes [EU leaders] have legitimacy to their own people, but they have no mandate nor legitimacy for taking European decisions... I cannot vote for this council. I can't hold them to account. I cannot even demand transparency.' And the MEP deplores that each government wields veto power, including Hungary's prime minister Vikor Orban, recently re-elected in a contest independent monitors said was tilted in the ruling party's favour. 'This guy was elected in unfair elections ... He is taking decisions that affect us all, I mean quite literally decisions of war and peace, life and death ... At national level something like this wouldn't happen. In most democracies, if there is someone in government who has broken the law, they have to resign.' She welcomes the victory of the pro-European French president Emmanuel Macron and the defeat of Slovenia's right-wing populist prime minister, 'Orban copycat' Janez Jansa. 'It matters if out of 27 government leaders two are anti-European or pro-European, it makes a difference.' But she doesn't see any government supporting the fundamental changes she advocates. 'It matters what kind of European Union they are advocating: I see no move anywhere in the member states to go for a more supranational European Union, more democratic.'  In part, the debate is an old fault-line: should the EU be led by powerful Brussels-based federal institutions, or is it a club of member states, where national capitals take the big decisions, with the commission as a secretariat. Today's EU is a mix of both, but the intergovernmental idea, championed by the former French president Charles de Gaulle decades ago, has been in the ascendancy for at least twenty years. Research shows that the commission is less likely to take wayward member governments to court than in the past, highlighting the sway of national governments over Brussels. 'The commission doesn't want to piss off the member state governments,' contends in 't Veld. 'And that is sort of the end of everything: you can pass as many laws as you like, but if they are not being enforced then there is no rule of law, because then everything becomes arbitrary.' To counter this, she argues the commission needs to be more independent of national governments. So she would scrap the rule of having one EU commissioner per member state. And the European parliament should have the power to dismiss individual commissioners, she thinks. Under current rules, to vote out one commissioner, MEPs have to bring down all 27. But the European parliament needs to start with itself, in 't Veld argues: 'Parliament doesn't use its political powers. If you mention ... motion of censure, or forcing the commission to resign, then everybody looks at you as if you are a sort of dangerous radical with a bomb in your hand. But, sorry, this is a very mature tool in any normal, mature democracy and it's happening all the time. 'In the past two years, governments have been sent packing in the EU. It's not the end of the world. The sun still rises the next day. So why are we so afraid of our own shadow?'", "9cf56933038781e2f31f9221ac52d7bd4b65a484568cf76f47134ed7": "More than half of people in four former communist central European counties fear media freedom is in danger, with significant majorities wanting government or EU measures to protect it, according to a survey. The findings, from respondents in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, are revealed in what is purportedly the biggest opinion study on the issue conducted in the 'Visegrad countries'. They will form part of the consultation process for a press freedom bill under preparation by the European Commission. The bill, spearheaded by the commission's vice-president for values and transparency, Vera Jourova, is being designed to safeguard media pluralism and independence amid rising concerns about ownership and potential government interference. In what organisers hope will provide a spur to action, 52% voiced concern about media freedom - with the highest figure, 63%, recorded in Poland, whose rightwing nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS) government stands accused of aggressively targeting independent media with expensive lawsuits while meddling in public broadcasting. Seventy-one per cent throughout the four countries backed government safeguarding legislation while 59% supported granting the EU more powers to protect media liberties. Misha Glenny, a British broadcaster and chair of the Committee for Editorial Independence - which commissioned the study along with the Czech committee of the International Press Institute - warned the EU against overlooking Poland's transgressions as a reward for its role in enacting western policy in Russia's war against Ukraine, particularly when compared with Hungary, which has refused to send weapons or cut energy supplies from Russia. 'What you've seen since Ukraine is that the European Commission and some European Union governments have decided that they are targeting [prime minister Viktor] Orban and Hungary because of their recalcitrant position and they are giving Poland a free pass on some of the rule of law issues,' he said. The study of 4,069 people was conducted over a 16-day period in February, before Russia's invasion. Hungary, where Orban's far-right Fidesz government this month won a fourth consecutive term, revealed the highest number of respondents - 47% - who think their country's media is not free. Only 30% assessed it as free, compared with 47% in the Czech Republic, where support for media independence is highest. Orban's government has come under scrutiny over opaque ownership acquisitions that have seen about 500 separate media outlets placed under an umbrella foundation, Kesma, and interference in public broadcasting that critics say has reduced television and radio stations to propaganda channels, often voicing pro-Russian war narratives. Support for media freedom among Fidesz backers is significantly lower than among other groups, said Vaclav Stetka, a media specialist at Loughborough university. 'Fidesz voters are a completely different tribe,' he said. 'Thirty per cent of them support media owners being in charge of content. That figure isn't replicated anywhere else.' Veronika Munk, the director of content at Telex, an independent Hungarian news site established after a pro-government businessman took over the outlet where she previously worked, said the decline of media freedom in Hungary served as a warning to others. 'Hungary shows how quickly things can change,' she said. 'In the Reporters Without Borders index for 2006, Hungary was 10th out of about 160 countries. We are now 92nd.' Asked if she feared things deteriorating further, she said: 'That possibility is always there. Our website is funded by readers' donations. One of my concerns is if the government decides to cut this economic link, which they could with a new law because they have two-thirds of the seats in parliament.'", "2d758f6641abaaaaf96275d9accd2a8095f542ee544ceae3ffdf203d": "In a windowless conference room in Canary Wharf, dozens of mining executives, bankers and government officials are being promised unique insights into how to profit from 'the deep-sea gold rush'. The hoped-for gold rush lies thousands of miles away on the bed of the Pacific Ocean, where trillions of potato-sized nodules of rare earth elements vital to power the next generation of electric cars have been discovered 4,000m below the surface. Mining companies are hoping that global rules to allow industrial scale deep-sea mining to collect the haul could be set in place as early as July 2023. However, environmental campaigners warned that mining for the metals would be 'dangerous', 'reckless' and cause 'irreversible harm' to little-known ecosystems. One estimate suggests that 90% of the deep-sea species that researchers encounter are new to science. Louisa Casson, a Greenpeace campaigner, criticised the industry for running the conference and banks for considering investing in the 'dangerous and unnecessary' projects to 'make a quick profit'. 'This destructive new industry wants to rip up an ecosystem we are only just starting to understand,' she said. '[They are] aiming to make a quick profit while our oceans and the billions of people relying on them bear the costs.' The nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone between Hawaii and Mexico were first discovered by the crew of HMS Challenger in 1875, but only recent developments in underwater robotics have made large-scale mining of the metals possible. The UN-affiliated organisation that oversees the controversial new industry has granted licenses for companies to explore the area, but full-scale mining has yet to start. That could soon change, however, as the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru has triggered a 'two-year rule', giving the International Seabed Authority (ISA) two years to implement regulations governing the industry. That set a deadline for a roadmap to be adopted by 9 July 2023. 'Deep-sea gold rush is a gamechanger,' read adverts for the Deep Sea Mining Summit 2022 at the Hilton London hotel in the capital's Canary Wharf district, for which delegates paid PS1,195 for the two-day event this week. 'After years of negotiations and false starts, deep-sea mining is close to a breakthrough. 'As we move into an era of mining the deep-ocean floor, the world's most remote environment, mining companies are working on overcoming the perceived challenges and developing island nations are watching with interest. As the demand for base metals and minerals surges ever beyond what our land is able to provide, new technological and technical developments are helping to drive forward this new industry.' Daniel Wilde, economic adviser on oceans for the Commonwealth Secretariat, which represents Nauru and many of the other small island states keen to start seabed mining, told the conference that he expected the ISA to agree a payment regime that would hand mining companies a post-tax profit of 17.5%. However, he warned the audience that 'the two-year deadline does seem quite tight, [and] if it's not agreed there are questions about what happens next'. Ebbe Hartz, a geologist at Aker BP, a Norwegian oil exploration company part-owned by BP, said mining for seabed metals could eventually overtake drilling for oil. 'But the problem is going to be finding [the metals], and we don't have a lot of data.' Hartz said machine-learning data collection would be key to the success of seabed mining, and would ensure 'we don't need to make all the errors we made with hydrocarbons'. Eleanor Martin, a partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright who advises banks on financing offshore projects, said global banks were 'very eager' to invest in deep-sea mining projects as they project the cost of lithium and cobalt needed for electric car batteries will continue to spiral upwards. 'To build the number of [electric] cars we will need, we will need much more of these metals.' 'Banks are sitting on pots of green money,' she said in reference to money designated for projects aimed at tackling the climate crisis. 'But they need to know that mining projects are green and sustainable.' Katherine Reece Thomas, an associate law professor and director of public international law at City, University of London, warned the industry that it needed to do more to win over public opinion before planning to start mining the oceans. 'There is an impossible conflict between those who say we can't possibly do this, to others who say we need to take this stuff in order to tackle climate change on earth,' she said. Jessica Battle, who runs the WWF's No Deep Seabed Mining campaign, said: 'Deep-seabed mining is highly risky and will cause irreversible harm to the ocean, to its life and its ability to help mitigate climate change. Investing in such a highly unsustainable industry at a time when we need to reduce our footprint on the natural world is irresponsible. 'Any short-term incentives offered are far outweighed by the long-term benefits of a healthy ocean and so WWF and others are calling for a global moratorium on deep seabed mining. Alternative solutions already exist - innovation, recycling and repair can satisfy industries' need for raw materials without opening the seafloor to mining.'  Casson, from Greenpeace, said: 'There is absolutely no need to mine the deep oceans and cause further harm to our planet. We've been pleased to see the biggest players in the electric car and technology sectors, including Microsoft, Google, Volvo, BMW and Samsung, all call out the greenwash of the deep-sea mining companies and commit not to use deep-sea mined minerals in their products. 'This nascent industry should stop before it even begins. We need to transition towards a more circular economy, in which we waste less and reuse more, instead of trying to destroy one of our planet's last great wildernesses at the bottom of our oceans in the name of profit.'", "901af344da38b73dd7882ce77c52c0a7ce32d4aa7141fd710f17fbd2": "There will be at least 15,000 instances of viruses leaping between species over the next 50 years, with the climate crisis helping fuel a 'potentially devastating' spread of disease that will imperil animals and people and risk further pandemics, researchers have warned. As the planet heats up, many animal species will be forced to move into new areas to find suitable conditions. They will bring their parasites and pathogens with them, causing them to spread between species that haven't interacted before. This will heighten the risk of what is called 'zoonotic spillover', where viruses transfer from animals to people, potentially triggering another pandemic of the magnitude of Covid-19. 'As the world changes, the face of disease will change too,' said Gregory Albery, an expert in disease ecology at Georgetown University and co-author of the paper, published in Nature. 'This work provides more incontrovertible evidence that the coming decades will not only be hotter, but sicker. 'We have demonstrated a novel and potentially devastating mechanism for disease emergence that could threaten the health of animals in the future and will likely have ramifications for us, too.' Albery said that climate change is 'shaking ecosystems to their core' and causing interactions between species that are already likely to be spreading viruses. He said that even drastic action to address global heating now won't be enough to halt the risk of spillover events. 'This is happening, it's not preventable even in the best case climate change scenarios and we need to put measures in place to build health infrastructure to protect animal and human populations,' he said. The research paper states that at least 10,000 types of virus capable of infecting humans are circulating 'silently' in wild animal populations. Until relatively recently, such crossover infections were unusual but as more habitat has been destroyed for agriculture and urban expansion, more people have come into contact with infected animals. Climate change is exacerbating this problem by helping circulate disease between species that previously did not encounter each other. The study forecast the geographic range shifts of 3,139 mammal species due to climatic and land use changes until 2070 and found that even under a relatively low level of global heating there will be at least 15,000 cross-species transmission events of one or more viruses during this time. Bats will account for the majority of this disease spread because of their ability to travel large distances. An infected bat in Wuhan in China is a suspected cause of the start of the Covid pandemic and previous research has estimated there are about 3,200 strains of coronaviruses already moving among bat populations. The risk of climate-driven disease is not a future one, the new research warns. 'Surprisingly, we find that this ecological transition may already be under way, and holding warming under 2C within the century will not reduce future viral sharing,' the paper states. Much of the disease risk is set to center upon high-elevation areas in Africa and Asia, although a lack of monitoring will make it difficult to track the progress of certain viruses. 'There is this monumental and mostly unobserved change happening within ecosystems,' said Colin Carlson, another co-author of the research. 'We aren't keeping an eye on them and it makes pandemic risk everyone's problem. Climate change is creating innumerable hotspots for zoonotic risk right in our backyard. We have to build health systems that are ready for that.' Experts not involved in the research said the study highlighted the urgent need to improve processes designed to prevent future pandemics, as well as to phase out the use of the fossil fuels that are causing the climate crisis. 'The findings underscore that we must, absolutely must, prevent pathogen spillover,' said Aaron Bernstein, interim director of the center for climate, health, and the global environment at Harvard University. 'Vaccines, drugs and tests are essential but without major investments in primary pandemic prevention, namely habitat conservation, strictly regulating wildlife trade, and improved livestock biosecurity, as examples, we will find ourselves in a world where only the rich are able to endure ever more likely infectious disease outbreaks.' Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that works on pandemic prevention, said that while human interference in landscapes has been understood as a disease risk for a while, the new research represents a 'critical step forward' in the understanding of how climate change will fuel the spread of viruses. 'What's even more concerning is that we may already be in this process - something I didn't expect and a real wake-up call for public health,' he said. 'In fact, if you think about the likely impacts of climate change, if pandemic diseases are one of them, we're talking trillions of dollars of potential impact. 'This hidden cost of climate change is finally illuminated, and the vision this paper shows us is a very ugly future for wildlife and for people.'", "8f956548187371633f9967b98f10fefa28b19036315f6c12ff2792f6": "More than a fifth of all reptile species are threatened with extinction, which could have a 'devastating' impact on the planet, a new study warns. The largest ever analysis of the state of the world's reptiles, published in Nature, found that 21% of reptile species are facing extinction. From lizards to snakes, such a loss could have disastrous impacts on ecosystems around the world, the study says. 'We would lose a combined 15.6bn years of evolutionary history if each of the 1,829 threatened reptiles became extinct,' said Neil Cox, co-leader of the study and manager of the biodiversity assessment unit at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Conservation International. 'This is evolution that we could never get back. It would be a devastating loss. 'If we remove reptiles, it could change ecosystems radically, with unfortunate knock-on effects, such as increases in pest insects,' he added. 'Biodiversity, including reptiles, underpins the ecosystem services that provide a healthy environment for people.' Fifty-two experts analysed data from the Global Reptile Assessment, which has received contributions from more than 900 scientists across six continents in the past 17 years. While 1,829 of 10,196 species are known to be threatened, the status of 1,489 could not be determined. Allowing for these data deficient species, the authors estimate that, in total, 21% are threatened. The study was led by NatureServe, the IUCN and Conservation International. Although many reptiles live in arid environments such as deserts and scrubland, most species occur in forests, where they suffer from threats such as logging and conversion of land for agriculture. The study found 30% of forest-dwelling reptiles are at risk of extinction, compared with 14% in arid habitats. The king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), for example, listed as globally 'vulnerable', is declining across much of its range in Asia, largely due to the loss of forest habitat. Hunting is also a major threat to reptiles, especially turtles and crocodiles, many of which are at risk of extinction. Another major contributing factor is the introduction of invasive species. Like birds or freshwater fish, reptiles tend to be less popular than iconic species of land mammals or marine life, but more reptile species are threatened than birds, suggesting more work is needed to protect them, said Mike Hoffmann, head of wildlife recovery at the Zoological Society of London, and one of the scientists involved with the study. 'From turtles that breathe through their genitals to chameleons the size of a chickpea and giant tortoises that can live to more than 100, they're utterly fascinating. Our hope is that this first-ever assessment of the world's 10,000-plus reptiles helps put them in the spotlight and goes some way to highlighting this diversity, and just how much we have to lose.' As well as controlling rats, mosquitoes and other 'pests', reptiles deliver many other benefits. 'They help disperse seeds, especially in island environments,' said Hoffmann. 'We've also achieved many medical advances from studies of reptiles. Snake venom, for example, has resulted in critical drug discoveries, including for treating hypertension. 'The impending loss [of reptile species] could lead to wide-ranging and unforeseen impacts on our environment and our own wellbeing.' In Australia, home to about 10% of the world's species, reptiles face a growing number of threats. 'Most of Australia's threatened reptiles have declined due to habitat loss and predation by invasive cats and foxes,' said Nicki Mitchell from the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Western Australia, who also contributed to the study. 'Climate change is an emerging threat to species confined to small fragments of habitat, as the microclimates they occupy will change and may no longer be optimal for a population to thrive.' The study is not all doom. Scientists noted that conservation efforts to help other animals are likely to be protecting reptile species as collateral. 'We found, surprisingly, that if you set out to protect places where threatened birds, mammals and amphibians live together, you'll simultaneously protect many more threatened reptiles,' said Bruce Young, co-leader of the study, and chief zoologist and senior conservation scientist at NatureServe. Yet reptiles also require direct, global, efforts to protect them, said Cox. The UN Convention on Biological Diversity is scheduled to convene Cop15's second phase in Kunming, China, later this year, where governments will negotiate new targets to protect biodiversity, including reptiles.  'We need solid conservation plans, global policy agreement, and to have countries fully invest in turning around the looming biodiversity crisis if we are to prevent the ongoing extinction catastrophe,' he said.

The proposals, released for consultation on Wednesday, outline sweeping reforms to institutions, councils and laws to try to stop people building in hazardous areas, preserve cultural treasures, improve disaster responses, protect the financial system from the shocks of future disasters, and reform key industries including tourism, fisheries and farming. 'The climate is already changing and there will be some effects we cannot avoid,' climate change minister James Shaw said. 'Just in the last few months we have seen massive floods, such as those in Tairawhiti; storms, such as those experienced recently in Westport; fires in the Waituna wetlands in Southland; and droughts right across the country.' 'These events demonstrate the case for urgent action on climate change - action to protect lives, incomes, homes, businesses and infrastructure.' Over the last year, some New Zealand communities have been repeatedly hit by devastating flooding. In March, Tairawhiti was hit with its second destructive flood in less than a year. Flood waters damaged homes, schools and infrastructure, with residents saying it would 'take about a year to clean up'. Last year, flooding in Westport left 450 homes unliveable or damaged. At the forefront of the plan is the challenge of how to adapt New Zealand's cities and housing stock - much of which is coastal - to the risk of rising seas and flood waters. According to the government, the scale of the problem is enormous: 675,000 people - one in seven New Zealanders - live in areas prone to flooding, amounting to nearly $100bn worth of residential buildings. Another 72,065 live in areas projected to be subject to extreme sea level rise. 'The number of people exposed to these hazards will increase as the climate changes,' the report says. It found that between 2007 and 2017, the contribution of climate change to floods and droughts alone cost New Zealanders an estimated $840m in insured damages and economic losses. Those figures present a huge, looming problem for homeowners, who face losing their ability to insure their homes as the risk level rises, and for local and central government, which have been met with furious revolt by some communities when trying to shift them away from hazards. The government's proposed changes, include updating the building code to make sure new builds account for climate hazards, ensuring the country's public housing stock is built away from hazards, creating incentives for development away from high-risk areas and making it compulsory to disclose information about climate risks to prospective buyers and builders. Some of those measures are likely to cause unease for homeowners, who are worried that climate risk assessments could tank the value of their homes. Shaw was clear that the government would not be picking up the bill for all such changes. 'Central government does not bear all the costs,' he said. 'The consultation asks how best to share risks and costs between property and asset owners, insurers, banks and local government as well.' The draft National Adaptation Plan outlines the actions the government will take over the next six years to respond to climate-related risks. It also includes proposals for protecting important cultural sites, such as coastal marae [maori meeting houses], and to adapt government-funded infrastructure to take climatic heating into account. It also covers proposed reforms of the tourism sector to ensure international visitors 'contribute to resilient, adaptable infrastructure and the natural environment they use' - possibly through an arrival fee or other taxes on tourists. Prof Bronwyn Hayward, of University of Canterbury, said via the Science Media Centre that the plan 'shows the enormity of the task facing the government after years of inaction'. 'We now need to implement climate planning guidelines across a raft of new legislation, and we need to think carefully about how people are exposed to repeated flooding effects - and I'd add fires - in the future. If homeowners, businesses, schools, ports or airports have to move away from a high-risk area for example, who pays?' Prof Anita Wreford, of Lincoln University, said that the plan was 'well overdue' and 'an improvement from New Zealand's current approach to hazards, which has been very reactive and focused on recovery after an event'. But she said the proposals were still very high level, and needed to provide 'much more guidance for decision-makers'. 'I suspect groups waiting in anticipation for this ... may have hoped for more concrete direction in implementing adaptation to achieve these goals.' The plan will be open for public consultation before the proposals are finalised by the government. 'Aotearoa will soon have a plan to bring down our emissions and help prevent the worst effects of climate change,' Shaw said, 'But we must also support communities already being hit by more extreme and more frequent weather events.'", "01e98c312b24a1954c46ec003681c3f4545a4432bca40d23cd845f87": "Sitting across from the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda last week, partway through a royal tour to celebrate the Queen's platinum jubilee, Prince Edward laughed awkwardly. Gaston Browne had just asked the prince whether he and his wife Sophie would use their 'diplomatic influence' to push for the payment of slavery reparations to Britain's former colonies. 'We believe that all human civilisation should understand the atrocities that took place,' the Caribbean nation's political leader told the Queen's youngest son. In the same meeting came a second blow. 'One day,' the prime minister told the couple, Antigua and Barbuda - a former British colony where the Queen is still the head of state - would cut ties with the monarchy and become a republic. Prince Edward shuffled nervously in his seat. 'I wasn't keeping notes, so I'm not going to give you a complete riposte,' he said. 'But thank you for your welcome today.' The painful exchange was one in a series of historic moments in the Earl and Countess of Wessex's week-long tour of the Caribbean, the second royal tour to the region in two months to be mired in controversy. By the end of the trip last Thursday, two Commonwealth nations had indicated their intention to cut ties with the royal family and become republics. St Kitts and Nevis also revealed its plan to review its ties with the monarchy. 'The advancement of the decades has taught us that the time has come for St Kitts and Nevis to review its monarchical system of government and to begin the dialogue to advance to a new status,' Shawn Richards, deputy prime minister, told reporters. The declarations follow similar moves by other Commonwealth realms, several of which signalled their own plans to cut ties with the monarchy following a separate tour of the Caribbean by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in March. During that tour, William and Kate were accused of harking back to colonial days after they shook hands with crowds behind a wire mesh fence in Jamaica, and rode in the back of a Land Rover like the Queen did 60 years ago. Protesters accused them of benefiting from the 'blood, tears and sweat' of slaves, while in the Bahamas they were urged to acknowledge the British economy was 'built on the backs' of slaves and to pay reparations. Jamaica's prime minister Andrew Holness told William and Kate that his country was 'moving on' and may be the next to become a republic, while a minister from Belize said it was time to 'take the next step in truly owning our independence'. The latest declarations mean six of the 14 countries beyond the UK that have the Queen as head of state have now indicated that they want to remove her - Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica and St Kitts and Nevis. If they do they will join countries including Trinidad, Guyana, Dominica and most recently Barbados, which became the world's newest republic in November. The royal tours have also led to renewed calls for reparations - an acknowledgement of the history of enslavement and payment for the damage - from Britain and the monarchy, even from countries with no current plans to cut ties with the Queen. In St Vincent and the Grenadines - which held a referendum on becoming a republic in 2009 that failed to pass when 55% of voters voted against such a move, and has no current plans for another vote - protesters as well as supporters greeted Edward and Sophie during their visit. 'This wrong was done against a sector of the human race by another and this wrong must be compensated,' said Idesha Jackson, 47, one protester who came out during the Wessexes' visit. The controversy has led to concern at the Palace. After returning to the UK in March, Prince William acknowledged the monarchy's days in the Caribbean may be numbered. ''I know that this tour has brought into even sharper focus questions about the past and the future,' he said, adding that the future was 'for the people to decide upon'. On Saturday it was reported that after getting home William and Kate summoned senior staff for a meeting to 'clear the air', with a source telling the Mirror they felt they had been 'poorly prepared'. 'If they aren't in tune with what is going on in the world they will be left fighting for their futures,' the source said. For now, future royal tours would be 'unwise', said Peter Hunt, the former BBC royal correspondent. 'The world has moved on in the wake of the Windrush scandal and Black Lives Matter,' he said. 'Any future trips would be unwise. The role of Britain and the monarchy in the slave trade would feature, and the royals appear ill-equipped to rise to the occasion.'", "86ecc0d58ad3abdde76c530a44149ab8dfde0149304126b4e8fa877c": "", "e8eabc216feb38df5b3630021d71b3dc14edafdf81c108f1db13a374": "Iraq was yet again covered in a thick sheet of orange on Sunday as it suffered the latest in a series of dust storms that have become increasingly common. Dozens were hospitalised with respiratory problems in the centre and the west of the country. A thick layer of orange dust settled across streets and vehicles, seeping into people's homes in the capital Baghdad. Flights were grounded because of poor visibility at airports serving Baghdad and the Shiite holy city of Najaf, with the phenomenon expected to continue into Monday, according to the weather service. 'Flights have been interrupted at the airports of Baghdad and Najaf due to the dust storm,' the spokesperson for the civil aviation authority, Jihad al-Diwan, said. Visibility was cited at less than 500 metres, with flights expected to resume once weather improves. Hospitals in Najaf received 63 people suffering from respiratory problems as a result of the storm, a health official said, adding that the majority had left after receiving appropriate treatment. Another 30 hospitalisations were reported in the mostly desert province of Anbar in the west of the country. Iraq was hammered by a series of such storms in April, grounding flights in Baghdad, Najaf and Arbil and leaving dozens hospitalised. Amer al-Jabri, of Iraq's meteorological office, previously said the weather phenomenon is expected to become increasingly frequent 'due to drought, desertification and declining rainfall'. Iraq is particularly vulnerable to climate change, having already witnessed record low rainfall and high temperatures in recent years. Experts have said these factors threaten to bring social and economic disaster in the war-scarred country. In November, the World Bank warned that Iraq could suffer a 20% drop in water resources by 2050 due to climate change. In early April, Issa al-Fayad, an environment ministry official, had warned that Iraq could face '272 days of dust' a year in coming decades, according to the state news agency INA. The ministry said the weather phenomenon could be addressed by 'increasing vegetation cover and creating forests that act as windbreaks'.", "41431c61920ca88830d9fb2c167323e8d56a326de9826c13e991aa88": "An extremely rare bible famous for an unfortunate error that encourages adultery has been discovered in New Zealand. The 1631 'Wicked' Bible, as it has become known, omits the word 'not' from its seventh commandment, informing readers 'thou shalt commit adultery'. One thousand copies of the text, which also came to be known as the Adulterous or Sinners' Bible, were printed, with the error only discovered a year later. Upon discovery of the mistake, the printers Robert Barker and Martin Lucas were summoned by King Charles I and hauled before the court, where they were admonished for the scandalous typo and sloppy workmanship. They were stripped of their printing licence, had a PS300 fine held over their heads for years (though it was eventually quashed) and most of the texts were destroyed. Only about 20 remain in circulation. The bibles do come up for auction from time to time mostly in Britain or US, but this is the first time one has been discovered in the southern hemisphere, says the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. The university was first informed of its existence in 2018 but chose to keep the discovery under wraps until now to allow researchers and book conservers enough time to study and preserve the book. 'It's a mystery, it's fascinating and it has made its way halfway around the world,' Chris Jones, an associate professor in medieval studies at the university and fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in London, said on Monday. A former student of Jones's brought the copy into to him in 2018 after her family had acquired it two years earlier at a deceased estate sale. The late owner was bookbinder Don Hampshire, who arrived in New Zealand in the late 1950s from the UK and died in Christchurch in 2009, but as far as Jones can tell, Hampshire had never told anyone a thing about owning it. Jones's former student told him she believed it was a 'Wicked' Bible, but he was 'very disbelieving because these are not common items'. 'They are not things that you just walk into an office having found one in a garage in Christchurch. But I looked at it and I thought, wow, this is exactly what my former student thinks it is - it's a Wicked Bible. I was blown away by it.' Jones said there is a copy in Canada, some in the US, others in the UK, Ireland and 'a very nice copy' in Dublin. 'The Australians claim they have one, but they don't,' laughed Jones, adding that their copy does not contain the infamous omission of 'not'. 'Having one come to me in Christchurch is just remarkable.' The discovery of the book piqued Jones's interest in the bible's history and the myths about why the mistake was made, the court case surrounding it, and the printing industry more widely at that time, which he plans to publish papers on. Debate is rife over how the misprint happened, with theories that it could have been a deliberate act of industrial sabotage by a rival printer. But Jones has panned that rumour, saying it is far more likely the printers, who were operating in a cut-throat industry, were just cutting costs on copy-editors. The life of the New Zealand copy, which is owned by the Phil and Louise Donnithorne Family Trust, remains a mystery before it arrived in the country. Where many bibles contain detailed descriptions of family trees, dates, places, and recordings of births and deaths, this copy has just one illegible name. The copy was in relatively poor condition when it was re-discovered, with its cover missing, some water damage, and a few pages at the back gone for good. But it also has some unique features - it is one of a few copies that has the more decorative red as well as black ink and is a much more complete version that many others out there. Book and Paper Conservator Sarah Askey has conserved the item, painstakingly treating the work, fitting a new cover and preserving it for future generations. Askey has documented any little features that could help provide clues as to where the book had been - in between some pages she found plant remnants, human hair and textile fibres. 'It was an awkward little thing to work around ... and there was a lot of problem solving, but that was quite satisfying to do,' Askey said. The book has been now fully digitised and will become free to the public via a website in the coming months - something Jones hopes will help shed more light on the copy's mysterious illegible name scrawled inside. 'I'm hoping someone will come and say 'Chris Jones, you're an idiot, this is really obvious', and I look forward to it.'", "22d6a13906a45e12ee632e2d4d90264150db26bd8cf58fd13b046444": "A senior judge who prosecuted terrorists and is now in hiding in Afghanistan feels 'heartbroken, abandoned and backstabbed' by the British government for refusing to bring him to safety despite a high court ruling in his favour. The high-profile judge, whom the Guardian is not naming for his safety, also received strong support from two former independent reviewers of terrorism legislation. He worked closely with British and American forces to prosecute Taliban, Isis, al-Qaida and Haqqani network terrorists captured in Afghanistan, and is at such high risk that he has to hide in separate locations from the rest of his family, who are also in hiding. He cannot have any direct phone conversations for fear of his location being revealed. A high court ruling on 1 April this year supported his claim for sanctuary in the UK. The UK government has accepted that he is at risk in Afghanistan but says he does not meet the policy criteria for being brought to the UK. Officials said his contribution to the UK's counter-terrorism work in Afghanistan was 'minimal' and that because the court where he prosecuted terrorists captured by the allies was an Afghan institution, he was not a direct employee of the British government. The judge faces having to make a highly dangerous journey to Pakistan to a UK visa-processing centre to get his biometrics done for a visa application. However, if the UK government then refuses the visa, he could be deported from Pakistan back to Afghanistan and placed directly in the hands of the Taliban. The high court ruling from Mrs Justice Lieven states: 'I do accept that if it did happen, it would place JZ [anonymised initials used in the ruling] and possibly his family at real and immediate risk of death.' She added that the UK government had failed to apply discretion to defer biometrics 'in a rational manner'. The former independent reviewers of terrorism legislation Lord Carlile and Lord Anderson wrote to the Home Office on 15 April, urging them to reconsider their decision not to allow the judge to come to the UK. 'The courageous acceptance by judges of the responsibility for incorruptible trial of terrorists ... made an important contribution to the lives of Afghans and to international counter-terrorism efforts,' they said in their letter. In a second case where the government has left Afghans in danger in their home country, an Afghan interpreter who worked for British forces and was badly injured in a Taliban bombing before being relocated to the UK has been trying for eight months to bring his parents and brothers from Afghanistan to safety in Britain. However, a Ministry of Defence (MoD) letter dated 26 April stated that officials had not yet been able to confirm the eligibility of the man's family for the Afghan relocations and assistance policy scheme and urged his supporters not to make the case public. The judge in hiding said through an intermediary: 'I am shocked by the government's decision to refuse to relocate me in the UK. I was once considered an important ally, given security due to the imminent threat I faced and awarded certificates of appreciation for making material contribution to the UK and allies' counter-terrorism mission in Afghanistan. 'I do not regret serving justice upon those who killed innocent people including UK government personnel, but I am heartbroken, abandoned and feel backstabbed by the government for refusing to relocate me in the UK. I plead with them to save my life and the lives of my family.' An MoD spokesperson said officials were unable to comment on individual cases: 'We recognise the challenging circumstances faced by Afghans applying to resettle in the UK through the Afghan relocation and assistance policy (Arap) scheme and are processing applications as quickly as possible. To date we have relocated over 9,000 applicants and their dependants to the UK. The scheme remains open and is not time limited, and we are determined to continue with this work.'", "29d1926a1faeaaa76c11a506022c2e1a2f10bb9fa1c29316e9d0e37e": "The government faces intense pressure from its own MPs and opposition parties to take action over misogyny and harassment in Westminster after a senior minister denied institutional problems, saying the problem was simply 'some bad apples'. A day after the Conservative MP Neil Parish resigned for watching pornography in the Commons, and as yet more allegations emerged about seemingly endemic sexual misconduct, a Tory ex-minister said Kwasi Kwarteng's comments 'dismissed and belittled' the experiences of female MPs. Labour warned that a toxic culture in Westminster was exacerbated by inaction from Downing Street, while its deputy leader, Angela Rayner, wrote to Boris Johnson about reports that one No 10 Christmas party saw a 'sexist of the year' award handed out. Kwarteng, the business secretary, faced significant criticism after rejecting the idea of inherent sexism in parliament, arguing that problems were mainly caused by long hours and overwork, and that very few MPs transgressed. 'I don't think there's a culture of misogyny,' he told Sky News. 'I think the problem we have is that people are working in a really intense environment, there are long hours and I think generally, most people know their limits.' Speaking later to Times Radio, he said the problem was 'some bad apples', who should be punished, adding: 'But that doesn't mean that the entire culture is extremely misogynistic or full of male entitlement. I don't recognise that.' Caroline Nokes, the Tory former minister who chairs the women and equalities committee, said Kwarteng's view went against the testimony of numerous MPs. 'Colleagues shared examples of the aggressions and microaggressions they face every day, and it's being dismissed by a senior cabinet member as the result of working long hours,' she said. 'Once more the experiences of female MPs are dismissed and belittled. That in itself is a classic example of institutional sexism.' Wendy Chamberlain, the Liberal Democrat chief whip, said Kwarteng was 'deluding himself'. She said: 'This is not a few bad apples, it is a culture that is rotten to the core. In the same week that two of his MPs resigned and his female colleagues complained, the worst thing he can do is trivialise and dismiss this.' Keir Starmer argued that with a series of misconduct cases, the government had either tried to ignore the issue or to delay any robust action, saying 'their first instinct is to push it off into the long grass, hide what's happening'. 'That is a political problem, because a fish rots from the head, and there needs to be political leadership on this as well,' he told Sky News. 'And we haven't seen that yet from the Conservative party.' Senior Tories have been pushing to get more female MPs, but Kwarteng said he is not 'a fan of quotas' to boost their numbers. Speaking to LBC radio on Sunday, the senior Labour MP Chris Bryant said that when he was first elected in 2001 he was 'regularly touched up by older, senior gay - they weren't out - MPs', adding: 'I never felt I was able to report it because you end up being part of the story, that's the last thing you want.' The Sunday Times reported a series of claims, including that one MP was accused of licking the faces of male researchers in bars; that a female Tory MP was sent a 'dick pic' by a colleague; and that another MP had been warned about his use of sex workers. The Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has suggested one way to safeguard staff would be to change the current system by which MPs employ their staff directly, instead doing this centrally. He said he is considering an outside body employing aides as he moved to establish a 'Speaker's conference' bringing MPs together to discuss an overhaul. In Rayner's letter to Johnson, she asked for details about another claim in the Sunday Times, that at a Downing Street party in December 2020 one aide was presented with a 'sexist of the year' award. Rayner also queried whether this had been reported to Sue Gray, the senior civil servant investigating alleged lockdown-breaking gatherings in parallel with a police inquiry. 'You have claimed on the record this week that there is 'no place' for sexism in politics, and yet there are now serious and credible allegations in the Sunday Times that sexist behaviour has not only taken place in your own office, but has been celebrated and rewarded,' Rayner wrote. 'You are ultimately responsible for the culture and activity that takes place within Downing Street under your administration. If true, these allegations are not only at odds with your professed opposition to sexism, but set a terrible example and must result in further action.' The furore over institutionalised sexism in politics kicked off a week ago with a much-criticised Mail on Sunday story citing unnamed Tory MPs saying Rayner would cross and uncross her legs during prime minister's questions to distract Boris Johnson. The paper leaped to its own defence this week, insisting Rayner was the source of the anecdote and that it had been unfairly targeted by opponents of a free press. A Labour source said: 'The vile suggestion that Angela Rayner initiated the sexist smears that have been made against her must be some kind of sick joke.' Parish's departure will pave the way for a byelection in the Tory safe seat of Tiverton and Honiton, and he still faces an investigation by the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). It was the latest in a series of damning developments that have dogged the Commons in recent weeks. Senior Labour MP Liam Byrne is set to be suspended from the Commons for two days for bullying a member of staff; David Warburton had the Conservative whip withdrawn after allegations of sexual harassment and cocaine use emerged; and former Tory Imran Ahmad Khan resigned after being convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. The ICGS has told MPs it is 'seeing a similar trend' to the previous year when cases were started against 15 MPs.", "3d33b16c9cb51175f8fee0f6ce6de29a97c9cc485661e955add20c69": "Restaurants across Beijing will temporarily ban dining-in and residents will need negative Covid tests to visit public spaces, officials said on Saturday, in a major ramping up of virus controls at the start of the Labour Day holiday. The five-day break is typically one of China's busiest travel periods, but the country's worst Covid resurgence since early in the pandemic is expected to keep people at home. Faced with the highly transmissible Omicron variant, Chinese officials have doubled down on their zero-Covid policy, quashing virus clusters through mass testing and lockdowns. Despite mounting economic costs and public frustration, the capital city announced it would further restrict access to public spaces during and after the holiday period. From 1 to 4 May, the city's eateries will halt dining-in, and only allow deliveries, local commerce official Ding Jianhua told a press briefing on Saturday. Authorities also said they had so far prepared 4,000 makeshift hospital beds - typically used for patients with light or no Covid symptoms - and were speeding up the setup of larger quarantine sites. A negative Covid test taken within the past week will also be needed starting on 5 May to enter 'all kinds of public areas and to take public transport', according to a notice on Beijing's official WeChat page. For activities such as sporting events and group travel, participants will also need to show a negative Covid test taken within 48 hours, along with proof of full vaccination, according to the new rules. China reported more than 10,700 domestic Covid cases on Saturday, with most in the country's economic engine, Shanghai. The eastern metropolis has been sealed off for about a month after becoming the centre of the latest outbreak. Cases are trending downwards, yet frustration and anger is mounting in the city of 25 million where many have been ordered to stay at home for several weeks. Shanghai officials said on Saturday its new cases had all been found among quarantined or restricted groups - signalling that community infections could be slowing. They added that hundreds of companies on a 'whitelist' had resumed work, with about 1,000 firms also allowed to restart operations, state media said. In Beijing, cases nudged up to 54, according to the national health commission. As the long holiday started, consumers in the capital were asked to show proof of negative Covid tests - from within 48 hours - to enter public areas such as malls, shops and scenic spots. The city will make Covid testing free for residents starting on Tuesday, authorities said.", "7c9296bde0b0c58bd59028631cfe895175692cff00f8cb16e80fb6fa": "Britain's central bank policymakers are 'duty bound' when they meet this week to push the UK into recession to cap rising inflation, a former Bank of England (BoE) official has said. Adam Posen, who runs Washington-based thinktank the Peterson Institute, said that while the Bank of England would not want workers to lose their jobs, it should hike interest rates now to squeeze out inflationary pressures made worse by Brexit trade and immigration restrictions. The BoE's monetary policy committee (MPC) meets on Thursday and is expected to increase interest rates by 0.25%, taking the central bank's base rate to 1% - its highest level since early 2009. Inflation in March peaked at 7% - its highest level for 30 years. Posen, who was a member of the MPC from 2009 to 2012, said the central bank needed to take more drastic action after Brexit reduced the UK's labour supply and limited the flexibility of the workforce. Without a U-turn by the government on trade restrictions and immigration policy, the BoE must shrink the economy. 'The central bank has no choice but to cause a recession when a broad range of prices are rising at such a strong pace,' he said. 'It is duty bound to bring inflation down after more than a year when it has been more than 2 percentage points above its 2% target level during a period of full employment.' He said wages were increasing due to shortages of workers and this was likely to add to inflationary pressures over several years unless further interest rate hikes were imposed. He added that if wages failed to keep pace with inflation over the rest of the year, it showed that the wage bargaining power of workers was weak and there was even more reason to put the brakes on rising prices. 'There is a greater risk of inflation persisting without further action in the UK compared with other major economies. The US is going through a period of high inflation that monetary policy will arrest. Euro area countries don't really have much inflation other than the spike in energy and food prices caused by the Ukraine war. 'The UK, on the other hand, has Brexit, which is going to restrict the supply of labour over the longer term, and trade restrictions that will keep prices higher than they would otherwise be,' he said. Opinion is divided among academics and City analysts over the next steps by the central bank, with some, including Posen's predecessor on the MPC, the labour market economist Danny Blanchflower, arguing that rates need to remain low to protect an economy already heading for recession. Blanchflower, a professor at the Ivy League university Dartmouth College, said several recent indicators showed the UK was already heading into recession and it would be irresponsible for the BoE to give it an extra push. But those calling for a succession of interest rate increases this year argue the faster pace of wage increases and strong levels of savings among middle and higher income groups will mean demand outstrips supply, generating even higher inflation. They say firms lack the skilled workers and raw materials needed to meet demand, and are likely to respond by increasing prices further. Shortages of workers pushed vacancy rates to a fresh record in the latest labour market figures covering the three months to February. The worst affected industries - IT, manufacturing, construction and hospitality - were those that relied most on foreign-born workers, mostly from the EU, Posen said. He added the UK was 'far more open to trade and immigration, and attractive for foreign investment before the 2016 Brexit vote'. Ken Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said: 'A recession in Europe is almost inevitable if the war in Ukraine escalates, and the Chinese economy may already be in recession. Writing on the Project Syndicate website, he added: 'And with US consumer prices currently increasing at their fastest rate in 40 years, prospects for a soft landing for prices without a big hit to growth look increasingly remote.' Last week the Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said Britain would postpone physical checks on fresh food imported from the EU for a fourth time, citing the likelihood they would cost UK firms PS1bn in red tape. A report last week by researchers at the LSE Centre for Economic Performance said that the introduction of new post-Brexit trading rules last year caused a 'major shock' to UK-EU trade. The research found UK imports from the EU fell by 25% relative to those from elsewhere in 2021. Its authors suggested new rules had also caused many smaller businesses to terminate relationships with suppliers based in the EU and stop exporting to the 27-member trading bloc.", "97827fa18960efd51b439b8d624e903b3865d7378ae7d140adca8b11": "Scrawled in looped handwriting among crates of candles in a walk-in storage cupboard, the pencil lines are still clearly visible on the wall at Audley End house. But for years, what - or who - the list in the 17th-century Essex mansion referred to was a mystery. Now the meaning has finally been unlocked, thanks to two Polish historians. They tracked 80 years of records and found that the list referred to six Polish special forces soldiers who trained at the grand Jacobean property during the second world war. The Cichociemni (the silent unseen) were a specially selected group of special operations paratroopers who were trained to drop behind enemy lines into occupied Poland to take on the Nazis. Audley End, then known as Station 43, acted as a finishing school for 527 of the elite soldiers who volunteered from Polish army units across the UK.  English Heritage will mark the 80th anniversary of the launch of the programme on Sunday, with a new display of exhibits about Station 43, openingon 2 May, which includes documents, pictures and everyday objects adapted for concealing messages. Over more than two years, men trained at Audley End for three-month periods, doing assault courses over the River Cam as they learned underground warfare, but the graffitied names are one of very few visible signs left of the Cichociemni, along with the remains of a timetable stuck to a wall in a former briefing room and ammunition labels inside a laundry cupboard. The six men completed training on 12 April 1944. Dr Andrew Hann, an English Heritage historian, said the latest findings offer valuable insights into the lives of the soldiers who trained on the property. While he had known for a few years that the graffiti was there, 'what we didn't know was what it actually meant'. He added: 'Then a couple of Polish historians came to look around, and my colleague, Peter, showed them into the cupboard. They said, 'Ooh, I think we know what this is'.' After checking their records, they confirmed it was the names of the special forces paratrooper trainees, and Hann started researching them at the Polish Underground Movement Study Trust archive in Ealing, using Google Translate to interpret their personnel files. 'It's been a very slow process,' said Hann. But, he added: 'It's a lot more than we knew before, and it makes them into real people, real personalities, rather than just a list of names.' The six men identified performed some extraordinary feats. Franciszek Socha, who was 29 when he finished training, was a teacher who studied at Lviv university and appeared to be the group's star student. During one mission, he was parachuted into northern France to obtain a specimen of poison gas, but was captured by the Gestapo. He managed to escape by jumping off a moving train and, with the help of the local resistance, made his way to a British submarine. Jan Benedykt Rozycki, then 43, was a former civil engineer from Klimkiewiczow who spoke five languages fluently. He parachuted back into Poland to deliver supplies to the Polish army. Other Cichociemni were hunted down under the postwar Soviet regime, but he stayed. In 1949, he was arrested on false charges and imprisoned for three years, and his son was killed while trying to free him. Eventually, he became director of the Polish Institute of Civil Engineering and died in 1991. The others included Teodor Paschke, 29, from Chodecz, an officer in the prewar Polish army who became a trainer at Audley End, Josef Zbrzezniak, 22, a printing company courier from Warsaw who fought in Italy, Karol Dorwski, 38, a prominent film and theatre actor from Lviv who starred in several prewar movies, and Czeslaw Migos, 23, a sergeant in the artillery who escaped Poland and joined Polish forces in France before being posted to Britain. However, the mystery over the reason for the list - and why some of the names are crossed out - remains. Suggestions include a record of borrowing rubber boots or those who have passed certain courses, but there is no definitive answer. 'It's one of those mysteries we will probably never discover. But what was really exciting is that they're such varied types of people with interesting backstories,' said Hann, adding: 'They're all obviously coming together with a common purpose to fight for their homeland and pushing themselves into the potentially very dangerous situation of being parachuted back into Poland.' The underground warfare course consisted of training in sabotage, field craft, reconnaissance and specialist training in disciplines such as microphotography and wireless operation. During the final stage, before being sent out into the field, soldiers would be briefed on the latest information about Poland, and invent aliases and false identities, as well as being given clothes and false documents. Such was the detail that they would even have their dentistry checked to ensure it was in keeping with their destination, so they would not be found out.", "e73d0a29c4b59956acc267d8af02694776d3ae3cd2fd18fcb67a7330": "", "9e6d5c02e2c73174451f011ab28c0695529f53044c41e6a214ed7eb2": "", "eb3d4949dca824d46901b8b1ed36b609645f362374a3da20cd281180": "", "c07c517c7cabf009f5026a8f0c33ca977d0b8465192f9dabff2b433b": "", "207a1af1fb839a8bda395cdd8156494c4d328df5d55e09da5839cac5": "", "c1843dbeaf02a1913b6c34c3063098bdbefd6a739d8c34134704c92a": "", "defe848f18d7ff8b0bc1474df814090754b4a59bd86c3370afb669c0": "", "27e7a498422114d7500ed010d3bb0eb91d939b6766a80935f61b282a": "", "5a1eb7a99673838b4383e3080bfe32944661eadde30018ad5a6cebf2": "", "adff549d4ced59c8fdabbc30914cc37bfb994efb8e20e30fcd22fde8": "", "c55e9489e9d0a3d723cfc27e3aa0689d3ea8cd42a4f757575ba92afc": "", "fd6c209599c1c1c8802d79e3b98d297e1d01c123d014bab3d33da905": "", "8a17f0a35708c91aba7ddf5bc55dde0c3c2287793165be71b017f44f": "", "a3dafa16b4724d49e4fcecaaeaef662388145d49e9b704822427440a": "A dog came bounding over as Oleh Bondarenko walked towards the garden containing the burned-out house where he had been beaten, tortured and left to die. 'Hey, friend,' he shouted, stroking her head and explaining the affectionate greeting. 'I talked to her a lot when I was here'. He lost several teeth to Russian assaults, his torso is covered with scars, and the damage to his spine may be permanent. But his sense of humour has somehow emerged unscathed from a days-long ordeal at the hands of Russian soldiers who served in Syria before bringing some of the horrors of that war to the once-bucolic countryside outside Kyiv. 'My small house,' he said with an ironic smile, peering down into a concrete pipe sunk into the ground to serve as a water cistern. It is not deep enough to stand in when the manhole cover is on and not wide enough to sit down; it is just about large enough to hold a man hunched over in a kind of slouch. Bondarenko was kept here for two days in March, slowly losing all feeling in his arms and legs, and then all ability to move them. Russian forces had arrived in Motyzhyn, just south of the main highway that leads west out of Kyiv, five days into the war. In a small wood on its outskirts they hid a battery of Grad rocket launchers and other artillery, excavated dugouts for dozens of troops, then set up camp to torture and murder civilians in the compound beside their position. By the time Bondarenko was brought there - blindfolded on top of a truck after beatings, mock executions and other torture at his home and then an abandoned farm - the soldiers had set up a grim routine, which they worked through each day in a drunken bloodlust. 'It was systematic,' he said. The grass next to the large porch of a storehouse was used for torture by officers who rested and ate under the canopy. The ruins of the bombed-out house was where executions took place, and in the nearby woods they dug shallow mass graves for victims. This nightmare was presided over by three men who had been shaped in a conflict notorious for abuses. Trapped in his underground chamber, Bondarenko heard them gloat about their transfer to Ukraine. 'They said that, after Syria, it was like a fairytale for them here,' he said. 'It is a wealthy village, and there was plenty for them to steal.' It has been clear since the invasion began that troops and officers fighting there included many who had been in Syria. But Bondarenko's testimony now links some of the worst abuses of this war to men who were on the ground thousands of miles away, defending the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Prosecutors for the Kyiv region, who have had to turn abruptly from investigating small-town crime to documenting extensive atrocities, are investigating the village killing camp. Oleh Tkalenko, a senior prosecutor for the Kyiv region, told the Observer: 'We are aware of these commanders. We are close to identifying them and their names will soon be released.' He also said authorities were aware that a number of Russian soldiers who came into the Kyiv region had previously operated in Syria. Bondarenko said intelligence services had already told him the first name of one of his main tormentors. In Motyzhyn, unlike in Syria, the soldiers could speak the same language as their victims, yet it made no difference. They used that connection simply to interrogate and torment without needing an interpreter. 'This is Russkiy Mir - the Russian world,' said Bondarenko with bitter irony, as he surveyed the killing field in his village, referring to the concept Vladimir Putin has invoked to justify his invasion, which denies Ukraine's nationhood and claims it as just a region of greater Russia. Bondarenko had been dragged into a local centre of operation for Moscow's murderous war simply because of where he lived - one of the twists of bad luck that has put so many thousands of Ukrainian civilians into the path of abusive soldiers and their guns. The head of the territorial army for the village, perhaps wiser than he was brave, had fled with his family at the start of the invasion. But he owned a yard next to a rehabilitation centre for drug users where Bondarenko is a live-in manager. The Russians were jumpy and angry after a Ukrainian ambush took out a convoy of ammunition heading through the centre of the village. 'The next day the Russians came round with two tanks, killed people and shot up cars and garages,' said Serhii Dovichenko, who works at the village shop, which was looted and burned. They also destroyed several homes by the site of the attack. On 23 March, convinced that the Ukrainian resistance was operating nearby, they burst into Bondarenko's centre, shooting the walls, mirrors and windows. They beat him, carried out a mock execution and then tied him to a quad bike and forced him to run as it drove off, telling him that if he fell he would be shot. He managed to stay upright until they reached a nearby farmyard, where they beat him again and faked another execution. Then, because he could not tell them the location of an army unit he was not part of, they loaded him blindfolded on to a truck and took him to their camp. Soon after he arrived, Ukrainian forces started shelling, and his captors fled to the basement, leaving him tied up outside. 'They told us, 'let your own kill you',' Bondarenko said, and a piece of shrapnel skimmed his stomach, causing bleeding and a scar. At the time he had no idea where he was, although the camp was barely two miles from his home. He realised what was going on there, however, when the soldiers told him they had just killed the much-loved head of the village council, together with her husband and son. Known to locals as Olga Petrivna, a name that mixed affection and deference, she had chosen to stay and coordinate aid and territorial defence when the Russians arrived. For that, her family all paid with their lives; a large billboard with a photo of them now marks the entrance to the village from the motorway, with a message: 'Eternal respect from the people of Motyzhyn.' They were subjected to the same sadistic ritual as most victims of the camp, locals said. They were badly beaten, their arms twisted and broken, then, as death approached, they were shot in the hands or knees to cause maximum pain, then shot again in the stomach before finally being killed by a bullet to the back of the head. Bondarenko said of one later murder he heard while underground: 'I could hear them killing him for an hour and a half, and I prayed they would take him quicker.' There were perhaps 60 soldiers at the Motyzhyn site, scattered in dugouts with officers in a house across a small lake. Not all were Syria veterans: there were also regular recruits - so fresh from Russia they didn't realise for two weeks they were in Ukraine - who had to cook for the commanders and carry water, and who were apparently horrified by what they saw. In a bid, perhaps, to salvage their own humanity, they rescued Bondarenko, 48 hours into his ordeal. While the torturers were drunk, the recruits dragged him out and carried him to a room used as a prison at the back of the house. They warned him to stay quiet and cover his face, because the commanders would assume he had joined others in the mass grave if they noticed he was missing at all, but if they found him they would certainly kill him. Two days later, the same recruits unlocked the door, said the Russians were leaving and warned the two men inside not to come out for two hours because of the risk from lingering snipers. 'They asked me to pray for them,' Bondarenko said. 'These guys didn't want any of this; they were in shock themselves, and to this day I pray for them. They saved my life.' The men had also dug an individual deep grave to bury a woman killed by a sniper after her father - who had been held with Bondarenko simply because he had come to the base to ask for medical help - begged them not to throw her into the mass pit. The Russians burned the forest and fields to deprive Ukrainian forces of camouflage. Now spring is returning, green shoots are emerging through the charred ground and daffodils are in bloom just a few metres from the torture chamber. Not far from the graves, a book lies open beside a dugout. Tales and Fairy Tales looks as if it had been abandoned mid-chapter by a young soldier in a rush to leave, who hadn't realised, or didn't want to know, that metres away a real-life horror had unfolded, and that he had been part of it.

The road twisted through a thick forest and a torrential summer storm lashed down. Macy lost control on a corner and the car hydroplaned, hurtling through the trees and flipping over three times before settling in a ravine. She was flung into the back seat and the vehicle pinned her left arm to the ground. Macy was frantic: she stretched for her phone, but couldn't reach it. She listened out for passing cars, but it was a remote spot and they didn't come often. The first went by without stopping, then the next, then a third. It became dark. Macy had lost feeling in the arm that was trapped, and her neck throbbed. By 10.30pm, 28 cars had come and gone. But then the 29th did stop: Macy heard the doors open, and the voices of her stepfather and brother calling her name. They followed the tyre skids down the embankment and her stepfather held her hand through the blown-out sunroof. Macy had kept it together until this point, but now she sobbed. The family had found Macy using the Find My Friends app, which allows users with Apple iPhones to share their location with others. Her mother, Catrina Cramer Alexander, had checked it when Macy hadn't come home and was not answering calls. They then jumped in their car and followed the pulsing blue dot to the ravine. 'Having that location, if we didn't have that, we would have never known where to look,' Alexander told a local TV station. 'I'm certain that that is what saved her life.' What happened to Macy is every parent's worst nightmare, though mercifully there was a happy-ish ending: Macy had a fractured neck and underwent an operation to repair nerve damage in her arm. But it's not hard to imagine a worse outcome. What if her phone had smashed? What if it couldn't get a signal in the forest? 'It's unreal that I survived that crash,' she said afterwards. Find My Friends was unveiled on 4 October 2011, the day before Steve Jobs's death, and has been installed as standard on Apple products since 2015. But the app was not the first or even the market leader: that's Life360, which describes itself as a 'family safety service' and has received funding from Google and Facebook since it was founded in 2008. Standard location-sharing apps, such as Find My Friends on iOS devices and Google Family Link for Android, give a GPS pinpoint for users, which they can either choose to reveal to others or not. Life360 does that too, but - for a fee - you can activate premium features, such as being notified if someone in your circle has been involved in a car accident, or if they have driven above the speed limit or even gone beyond a set 'geo-fenced' area. There is a significant market for these features. Life360 is used by 32 million people in more then 140 countries; it's currently the seventh most downloaded social-networking app on the App Store and its San Francisco-based company has been valued at more than $1bn. A survey of 4,000 parents and guardians in the UK in 2019 found that 40% of them used real-time GPS location tracking on a daily basis for their children; 15% said that they checked their whereabouts 'constantly'. That word 'constantly' will send many teenagers into a cold sweat. At best, location-tracking apps can feel like an extension of helicopter parenting; at worst, they might feel like stalking. While all the apps tend to emphasise that they provide security for the child and peace of mind for the parent, some clearly go into deeper, more invasive territory. One, Find My Kids, allows you to activate the microphone on your child's phone remotely, so you can eavesdrop on their interactions. OurPact gives you access to screenshots of your child's online activity, 'all encrypted for maximum safety'. Bark monitors and scans messages sent from a device, looking for issues such as 'cyberbullying, sexual content, online predators, depression, suicidal ideation, threats of violence, and more'. The app claims to 'cover' almost 6 million children, and has detected 478,000 'self-harm situations' and 2.5m 'severe bullying situations'. Location tracking has become a battleground in many families, bringing up issues of trust, privacy and personal growth. And while the discussion mostly relates to teens, it can start much earlier. Find My Kids, which launched in Russia in 2016 and is now worldwide, notes on its website: 'Youd [sic] kid is too young for a smartphone? Use children's GPS smartwatch!' In the US, the GizmoWatch 2 offers real-time location tracking and is aimed at children as young as three. KIDSnav is pitched at five-year-olds and up and offers GPS tracking and a built-in microphone to listen in on whatever is happening around your child. All parents have to ask themselves what is best for their child. And Macy Smith and her family are in no doubt that location-tracking apps can be invaluable: in fact, after the accident, the family upgraded from Find My Friends to Life360, because of the crash detection and roadside assistance it offers. 'I know it's hard for teenagers to give up your privacy,' Macy told ABC News, 'but sneaking out and being places you don't want your parents to know about is not worth being trapped under a car for seven hours.' In a sense, location-tracking apps have crept up on us. Most parents would agree that planting a chip in your child that monitored their movements and vital signs - as depicted in the Arkangel episode of the dystopian, tech-anxiety series Black Mirror in 2018 - would be a little extreme. But smartphones have put similar technology in all of our pockets and, well, when it's 12.30am and you want to go to bed and your kid's not back from their friend's house, it's pretty difficult to resist. 'If it's on your phone, why would you not look?' says Sonia Livingstone, a professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who has written extensively on children's rights in the digital age. 'Up till now, parents and children had evolved lots of ways of handling it: 'Phone when you reach your friend's... I won't worry as long as you're home by 11.' But now with the apps and tracking, you know everything. So it's: 'Why did they go to the shopping centre on the way to their friend's? They said they were going to this friend, why are they on that side of town?' Once you've got information, it is almost wrong not to look at it.' Not all teenagers find location tracking an invasion of their privacy. Many are happy to share their whereabouts constantly with their friends: Snap Map, a popular, opt-in function of Snapchat, pinpoints the user's exact position and those in their circle (with alarming accuracy) whenever the app is turned on. Some don't even mind their parents keeping tabs on their movements. 'When I think about it, it makes me feel safe, because I know that Mum or Dad knows where I am,' says Lola Pethybridge, a 17-year-old student from south London. 'Or even my brother' - who is two years younger - 'if it came down to him having to figure out where I was. It's just that safety net where you can say, 'I need help.' Or, 'Can you come and get me?' And the relief of, 'Oh, someone I trust knows where I am.'' Next year, Pethybridge hopes to go to university - will she turn off the family's Find My Friends then? 'Just judging by my habits,' she says, 'I don't think I will.' The subject of location tracking is a more contentious issue with other families. Alicia Hardy, a solicitor from Petersfield in Hampshire, encouraged her two children, Ben and Louise, to use Find My Friends after hearing about it from her sister who lives in the US. Ben, who was 17 at the time, lasted for about a month. 'At that point in my life, I wasn't necessarily that happy about Mum knowing where I was all the time,' says Ben, who is now 23. He smiles, 'I was sneaking out to smoke, so I didn't want Mum to see that I was leaving school.' Louise, meanwhile, was 14 and went along with her mother's Find My Friends request; now 20, they both still use it. 'I introduced it not because I wanted to catch my kids out doing stuff wrong, because frankly, I did stuff wrong, but for me it was more an anxious-mother thing,' explains Alicia. 'Children can be on their phones all day to their mates. But they don't answer their phone to their parents or text them back. And that's really, really irritating for parents, because they systematically would not answer for hours. I tend to catastrophise, whereas Marco doesn't even think about it.' (Marco Hardy, her ex-partner and Ben and Louise's father, agrees: 'I've never even looked at an app or even contemplated it,' he says.) By many objective measures, young people face fewer dangers than they did a generation ago, but it probably doesn't feel like that to their parents. Livingstone has found in her research that daughters are especially likely to be tracked, with concerns about sexual assault and, in recent times, reports of drink-spiking. Many of the apps lean into these worst-case scenarios. One of the add-ons that Life360 offers is Disaster Response: 'Evacuation support in case of natural disasters, active shooter events, and more.' Louise Hardy agrees that, at times, location-tracking apps have made her feel safer, but still has some conflict about them. 'As a kid you're meant to do stuff that your parents don't know about,' she says. 'You're meant to make mistakes, you're meant to mess up. So them always having an eye on you takes away from childhood a little bit. But Mum is a worrier, so it's just a case of keeping her a bit sane.' The Hardy family are clearly very open with each other, and that's important according to Philippa Perry, a psychotherapist and the Observer Magazine's agony aunt. 'Children sometimes want some things to be private,' she says. 'I never used online monitoring with my child because she was an adult before I knew about the software. I relied on that old-fashioned method of asking her where she was going. Once she answered me, 'I'm not telling you.' To which I replied, 'Darling, even Dad has to tell me where he's going so we know where to start the police search.' Which, luckily, she found reasonable.' For Perry, location tracking, like most technology, is neither good nor evil: what matters is the boundaries you set and all parties being comfortable with the negotiation. 'It's not for an outsider like me to say whether or not to use it,' she says. 'Like all things, if you want your children to be open with you and feel like they can tell you anything, don't react angrily or negatively or dismissively when they confide in you. If you have done this in the past and now you have a mute teenager, try to repair that rupture by telling them where you overreacted in the past without making excuses for yourself and say you'll do better next time. And do better next time.' Many teens feel a line has been crossed, especially when their parents make location tracking a condition of paying their phone bill. On the online forum Reddit, on boards such as r/insaneparents and r/raisedbynarcissists, kids share horror stories and screenshots of unhinged interactions with their parents. On TikTok, videos instruct users on how to change their phone settings to fool Life360 into freezing their location ('I broke Life360, you are welcome'). On Twitter, a 20-year-old called Cedar Rose from Kansas City recently made an appeal for $3,000 so they could leave home and their 'homophobic... anti-vax' parents who track their movements constantly on Life360. 'This is my final resort,' they wrote. 'I have no freedom in this house, absolutely none. And I can't take it any more.' To date, Cedar has only raised $510, along with some snide comments that they should 'just get a job'. Whether the use of these apps keeps children safer and more sensible is disputed, but there is obviously the potential to impact relationships between parents and their offspring: certainly where trust has been eroded, location tracking is unlikely to repair the damage. A small study in the Netherlands found that teenagers who were monitored were more secretive and less likely to confide in their parents. 'If young people want their privacy, they'll find a way of getting it,' predicts Livingstone. Where there is more widespread agreement, though, is concern about what happens with the data that is collected. Life360, for example, made $16m in 2020 from selling location data (it is how the app keeps its basic model free, the company states). This information might end up with insurance companies, or realistically with anyone who feels there is a value in paying for it. Livingstone says, 'The idea that children are getting a detailed digital footprint not of their own making that tracks everywhere they go, and that's being used to sell advertising to them now or later, is reprehensible.' It's no spoiler that in the Black Mirror episode Arkangel, the (well-intentioned) use of location tracking ends in disaster: the abject breakdown of trust and understanding between a mother and daughter. ' In the real world, the experiment - that we have only tenuously signed up for - is ongoing and we will experience the results as they happen, with the fallout felt by our loved ones. 'Children have always had times in which they were unobserved and playing outside and generally at risk and coping,' says Livingstone. 'We have a crisis in mental health, so it may all be linked that they're not developing those everyday habits of resilience. But there are some huge unknowns: we have no idea really what it is to grow up when you are constantly observed. So in that sense, we just have to say, we don't know.'", "dd124f549bdf87def9934c6af9b419c197569bab21001b4308383072": "The distinctive sight and sound of a Dartford warbler singing from the top of a sprig of gorse in the May sunshine is making a welcome comeback after the bird almost became extinct half a century ago. Dartford warblers suffered a population crash and were at risk of vanishing from the UK in the 1960s, largely because of loss of the lowland heathland they thrive in. But the RSPB is reporting the highest recorded number of Dartford warblers - 183 pairs - at its reserves including RSPB Arne in Dorset and RSPB Minsmere in Suffolk. As well as needing the cover provided by gorse, the bird is susceptible to harsh weather and was almost wiped out in the big freeze of 1962-3 but recent milder weather has helped it to bounce back. The population has recovered in recent years and by 2019, 23 pairs were found at the Minsmere coastal reserve; the figures show that there are now 37 pairs there. Mel Kemp, the warden at Minsmere, who has overseen heathland restoration at the site, said: 'We have seen a steady increase in the number of Dartford warblers, alongside other species relying on heathland habitats such as nightjar. All the hard work of restoring this habitat has really paid off.' The Dartford warblers are long-tailed warblers; male slate grey and chestnut birds are often spotted singing from the tops of gorse bushes in the spring sunshine, hoping to attract a mate. As well as being the perfect singing platform, the spiky shrub provides a safe nesting place and hunting ground for the bird, which specialises in picking spiders and caterpillars from their hiding places. Heathland supports a range of wildlife, from birds and mammals to insects, reptiles and amphibians but it is one of the UK's most threatened homes for nature, with 80% lost since the 1800s through change of land use. Kemp said: 'We need to continue to restore, manage and protect the heathland we have left here in the UK to best ensure the future of not just the Dartford warbler, but many other species.' As well as doing well in Dorset and Suffolk, Dartford warblers have been seen at RSPB reserves in Devon, Kent, Surrey and Hampshire. The return of the warbler is the second piece of good bird news in a week for Dorset after it was revealed that a pair of ospreys in Poole harbour had produced an egg, the first breeding attempt for the species in southern England for almost 200 years.", "5f74257e165851223645a504691f4cff55884f9ff5693b3c49c438f5": "", "bdd1c637961c578b7cf57644bc74fe7e0d17c9ceabc13c7601a69051": "", "4c2cf9c20f801a50ab0e8feca360b157da30b9ffeb28d9b9e4abbdf2": "", "383d359d6046c2ff48a131182727fb2c897eda1f29718ddfe9835695": "", "7e2ab630e689f3fd15d1036c6b4d088f23bc488ccabb3f18b3b8a321": "", "c282ec8e24bcf2cbc9199606e5889e6235904f46084f89c77bc8fae6": "", "1f71816e9a0940c61796d6db016fced4a37859ec9cf9d11478449d2b": "", "882ddb932710af05691c62bf2d249bc49ea94cea3e30c3014708d6f4": "", "9eb1a91a72f1ab71a7b717144dda3ec6d246ff84bdaa1411b64e6019": "", "bbb5e39aaa93721a58830e02db831e968ca738668064cf159596b5e8": "", "54747aa1d6098dd8ce698d17d1daa3dcee18c528ce830ceeac8accaf": "", "d7963568fc7d011af4e2c104a06150b947fb3e1bfe81192a9693401b": "", "ac4832f108d1409c6b49b2849b0dbfd0a923b62881bc78dc54db0f87": "", "416ef95a0916d1846b525d9e36474cd788cbcdec2e0d36d2a0f9ca45": "", "28095650255c325adc63364045dcb2b83c8cf7c5b7a4599407972ecc": "", "e096cfab39072257ce6c3bba0f0262da96944a3de7e09f0378c3def5": "Around 100 civilians were on Sunday evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, the last holdout of Ukrainian forces in the city.

The trip also includes stops in the Slovakian cities of Bratislava, Kosice and Vysne Nemecke, where Biden will meet with government officials, refugees and aid workers, her office said. Biden's visit is the latest show of support for Ukraine and neighbouring countries that are helping Ukrainian refugees by top US representatives. South Korean ambassador Kim Hyung-tae has returned to Kyiv along with some embassy staff, the news agency Yonhap has reported citing the Foreign Ministry in Seoul. The South Korean embassy was evacuated at the beginning of the Russian invasion and staff had been working at a temporary office in the western Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi since March. The ministry said Kim would start working from Kyiv on Monday and that it was considering the phased return of remaining staff in accordance with the future security situation there. More than 20 embassies, including those of the EU, UK, France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, have already reopened in the Ukrainian capital. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said US diplomats would gradually begin returning to the country during a visit to Kyiv last week.  Associated Press has filed a story saying that the Ghost of Kyiv, an unnamed fighter pilot who was praised for supposedly shooting down several Russian planes, is in fact a myth. Adam Schiff, chairman of the US House Intelligence Committee, has told CNN 'it's only a matter of time' before US president Joe Biden visits Ukraine. On Sunday US House speaker Nancy Pelosi became the highest ranking US official to meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv since the start of Russia's invasion at the end of February. The House delegation had discussed Zelenskiy's priorities for the next phase of the war, which is concentrated in the east of the country after Russian forces withdrew from around the capital, and Biden's request for a $33bn aid package for Ukraine, Schiff said: Russia's top uniformed officer, General Valery Gerasimov, visited dangerous frontline positions in eastern Ukraine last week in a bid to reinvigorate the Russian offensive there, the New York Times has reported citing Ukrainian and US officials.  The Guardian was unable to verify the report. During the visit, Gerasimov, chief of the Russian general staff, narrowly escaped a deadly Ukrainian attack on a school being used as a military base in the Russian-controlled city of Izium late Saturday, the Times reported.  Around 200 soldiers including at least one general were killed in the strike, a Ukrainian official told the paper, but Gerasimov had already departed for Russia.  The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based think tank, earlier said that Ukrainian forces had 'likely conducted a rocket artillery strike on a Russian command post in Izyum on April 30 that struck after Russian chief of staff Valery Gerasimov had left but killed other senior Russian officers.' US officials could not confirm the attack and the Russian Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'Our working assumption is that he was there because there's a recognition they haven't worked out all their problems yet,' one of the US officials told the Times. The Russian offensive has been slow, with widespread disarray and poor morale reported among Russian forces. The Kremlin appears to be focusing its operations around the city of Izium as part of renewed efforts to seize the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Gerasimov has reportedly been put in command of the push. Two explosions have taken place in the early hours of Monday in Belgorod, the southern Russian region bordering Ukraine, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the region's governor has written in a social media post. 'There were no casualties or damage,' Gladkov wrote, according to Reuters. On Sunday Gladkov had said one person was injured in a fire at a Russian defence ministry facility in Belgorod, while seven homes had been damaged. Posts on social media said fighter jets and loud explosions had been heard above the city overnight. The Guardian was unable to verify the reports. Russia last month accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack on a fuel depot in Belgorod, for which Kyiv denied responsibility, as well as shelling villages and firing missiles at an ammunition depot. A few more images captured by Reuters of the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, showing emotional scenes as people were reunited with family members in the village of Bezimenne in the Donetsk region: Around 100 civilians were on Sunday evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, the last holdout of Ukrainian forces in the city. Around 1,000 civilians and 2,000 Ukrainian fighters are thought to be sheltering in bunkers and tunnels underneath the plant, enduring a weeks-long siege with little food or water. One of the civilians evacuated spoke to Reuters, telling the news agency, 'We didn't see the sun for so long':  Hello, this is Helen Livingstone taking over the blog from Maanvi Singh to bring you the latest from the war in Ukraine. First a bit more from Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov's interview with Italy's Mediaset broadcaster. He said that Russia was not demanding the 'surrender' of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a condition for peace. He also denied that Russia would attempt to claim victory in Ukraine by 9 May - when Russia marks the end of the second world war with Victory Day - saying that the Russian military would not 'artificially adjust their actions to any date, including Victory Day.' Asked about recent rumours concerning the health of president Vladimir Putin, he did not answer directly, saying instead:  - Jennifer Rankin, Harry Taylor, Maanvi Singh, Rob Booth In Kherson, the first major city to fall, Russia is replacing Ukrainian currency with Russian rubles.  Per AFP, Kirill Stremousov, a civilian and military administrator of Kherson said that 'beginning 1 May, we will move to the ruble zone,' according state news agency RIA Novosti. It is a tactic to legitimize Russia's 'control of the city and surrounding areas through installing a pro-Russian administration,' according to an intelligence update released by Britain's Defense Ministry. The move is 'indicative of Russian intent to exert strong political and economic influence in Kherson over the long term,' the Defense Ministry said.  Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said that the county is working to prevent nuclear war, Reuters reports.  In an interview with Italian TV, Lavrov said: 'Western media misrepresent Russian threats. Russia has never interrupted efforts to reach agreements that guarantee that a nuclear war never develops'. Lavrov also doubled down on Russian conspiracy theories and propaganda about Nazism in Ukraine.  This week, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby called Russia's justification for the war in Ukraine 'BS'. 'It's hard to square [Vladimir Putin's] ... BS that this is about Nazism in Ukraine, and it's about protecting Russians in Ukraine, and it's about defending Russian national interests, when none of them, none of them were threatened by Ukraine,' Kirby said. 'It's brutality of the coldest and the most depraved sort.' Eight have died after Russian attacks on Donetsk and Kharkiv, according to the governors of those regions.  AFP reports:  Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelenskiy said that evacuations from Mariupol will continue tomorrow if 'all the necessary conditions' are met. 'Today, for the first time in all the days of the war, this vital corridor has started working,' he said. 'For the first time there were two days of real ceasefire on this territory.' In his latest address, he said:  Isobel Koshiw and Ed Ram in Kharkiv report:  In Ukraine's second city, where the barrage of Russian shelling has been among the most relentless endured, hundreds of people stand in line at a post office, waiting to be given chicken and potatoes. As elsewhere in the country, the mundane institutions of civil society of Kharkiv have had to be hastily repurposed for the goal of keeping its population alive, and about 30 such locations across the city have been turned into food aid distribution points. The postal workers at this branch of Nova Poshta, who are being paid by their employer to hand out food instead of post, say that an average of 3,000 people come to their repurposed branch every day, seven days a week. They manage the queues using the post office's ticket system. 'There's no work. The No 1 thing at the moment is humanitarian aid,' says Ihor Shapovalov, a construction worker who lost his job on 24 February and has just received a quarter of a chicken. 'We just want to thank the guys for everything they're doing.' Kharkiv has been the worst-hit city still under Ukrainian government control. Since the war began two months ago, civilians have died and been injured almost every day as a result of incoming Russian shelling. On Saturday, one person died and five were injured as a result of mortar fire, according to the regional governor. The city is starting to see signs of life, but its economy is in tatters. The vast majority of shops and businesses are still closed. Another man waiting in the queue at the repurposed post office is 30-year-old Zhenia Myrhorod. He says he had tried to get work unloading humanitarian aid at a warehouse, but there was not enough work to go around. 'I even collected metal from the missiles but couldn't find anyone to buy it,' says Myrhorod. 'I'm 30 years old. I've got legs and arms, but nobody wants them.'

The civilians had been sheltering in bunkers beneath the steelworks that is the last redoubt for Ukrainian forces in Mariupol.  On Sunday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said about 100 civilians evacuated from the steel works and would arrive in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday morning.  'For the first time, we had two days of a ceasefire on this territory, and we managed to take out more than 100 civilians - women, children,' Zelenskiy said in a nightly video address. He said he hoped evacuations would resume on Monday at 8am local time (0500 GMT). The head of the Donetsk Regional Military Administration later said the evacuation would begin at 7am (0400 GMT). As many as 100,000 people are believed to be in the blockaded city, which has endured some of the most terrible suffering of the Russian invasion. These include 1,000 civilians and 2,000 Ukrainian fighters thought to be sheltering underneath the Soviet-era steelworks, the only part of the ruined city not taken by Russian forces. After enduring a vicious weeks-long siege that forced people into confinement in basements, without food, water, heat or electricity, Russian forces closed in, leaving the steelworks as the last remaining stronghold. Vladimir Putin decided not to storm the plant, but called on Russian troops to blockade the area 'so that a fly can't get through'. The UN confirmed on Sunday that a 'safe-passage operation' to evacuate civilians had begun, in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross, Ukraine and Russia, but declined to give further details in order to protect people. Zelenskiy's chief of staff Andriy Yermak suggested the evacuations could go further than just the civilians holed up in the steelworks. 'This is just the first step, and we will continue to take our civilians and troops out of Mariupol,' he wrote on Telegram. Earlier, Reuters reported that more than 50 civilians in separate groups had arrived from the plant on Sunday in Bezimenne, a village about 20 miles (33km) east of Mariupol in territory controlled by Russian-backed separatists. The group arrived in buses with Ukrainian number plates as part of a convoy with Russian forces and vehicles with UN symbols. An evacuee in Bezimenne, Natalia Usmanova, 37, told Reuters she had been so terrified as Russian bombs rained down on the plant sprinkling her with concrete dust that she felt her heart would stop. 'When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical. My husband can vouch for that. I was so worried the bunker would cave in,' she said. 'We didn't see the sun for so long... You just can't imagine what we have been through - the terror.' Russia's defence ministry said on Sunday that 80 people, including women and children, had left the Azovstal works, according to the state news agency Ria Novosti. Russian forces have obliterated the port city of Mariupol, a major target for Moscow because of its strategic location near Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. In other developments: News of the Azovstal steel plant evacuations came as the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, met Zelenskiy in Kyiv, where she pledged enduring support for his country's 'fight for freedom'. Pelosi, whose visit was not announced beforehand, is the highest-level US official to meet the Ukrainian president since the war began. 'We are visiting you to say thank you for your fight for freedom,' she said in video footage released on Zelenskiy's Twitter account. 'And that your fight is a fight for everyone, and so our commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done.' Speaking at a press conference in Poland on Sunday, Pelosi said the US would hold its resolve, after being asked whether Washington was concerned about its support provoking a Russian reaction. 'Let me speak for myself: do not be bullied by bullies,' she said. 'If they are making threats, you cannot back down.' Last week Joe Biden called for a $33bn (PS26bn) package of military, humanitarian and economic support for Ukraine, more than doubling the level of US assistance to date.  While the US is increasing support for Ukraine, Germany's chancellor rejected criticism that Berlin was not doing enough. In an interview with Bild am Sonntag, Olaf Scholz said he took decisions 'fast and in concert with our partners'. Meanwhile it emerged that the EU is looking at banning Russian oil imports from the end of 2022, in the latest effort to cut funds to Vladimir Putin's war machine.  Russia continued its refigured campaign to seize parts of southern and eastern Ukraine, after failing to take Kyiv. On Sunday, Russia's defence ministry said it had attacked an airfield near Odesa and claimed to have destroyed a hangar that contained weapons provided by foreign countries.  Meanwhile, the governor of Kharkiv warned residents on Sunday not to leave shelters because of 'intense shelling'. Oleh Synyehubov asked residents in the north and eastern districts of the city, especially Saltivka, not to leave their shelters unless it was urgent.

Not only are frustrated Ukrainian refugees withdrawing from the scheme after waiting up to six weeks for a visa to materialise, but UK sponsors are also deciding to walk away because of problems with issuing visas to families fleeing the war. Following claims made last week by a whistleblower, the Observer has been inundated with cases of sponsors reporting difficulties in providing a home for Ukrainian refugees. One group, Holme Valley Homes for Ukraine in west Yorkshire, said that out of 160 applicants to the scheme a quarter - 40 - had pulled out because of delays in trying to obtain a visa to travel. The EU, by contrast, has waived the need for Ukrainians to have a visa. 'Families are pulling out and choosing not to come to the UK because of the amount of time it is taking for visas to come through,' said Rebecca Gough, one of the coordinators of the Holme Valley sponsor scheme. On Saturday morning a family of six Ukrainians told the group that they would be staying in Romania because of the visa delay. At the same time a UK sponsor decided they could not wait any longer for a Ukrainian Muslim family who had endured racism when they fled to Poland and are now 'destitute' in Baghdad. The most common obstacle appears to be families who do not receive visas for all its members. The whistleblower, who was working on the Homes for Ukraine helpline, revealed that he had dealt with numerous cases where UK visas had been issued for an entire Ukrainian family apart from one member, which in effect stopped the family travelling to the UK but allowed the government to say it had issued a number of visas. The allegations forced Home Office minister Kevin Foster to respond last week, telling parliament that claims that Ukrainian children were not being granted visas to prevent their families from travelling to the UK as 'absolute nonsense'. But last Thursday the government acknowledged that processing problems within the Home Office had led to delays. Gough said they had seen a lot of cases dating back to when the scheme was announced on 14 March, where visas hadn't been issued to one family member, but the rest had been granted. 'I have seen so many cases of parents without children and children without parents so they can't travel. This scheme isn't good news, it's a disaster,' she added. Gough also revealed that a number of Ukrainians had grown weary of waiting for a UK visa despite having a sponsor and had returned to the Mariupol area. 'They have not been in contact for 10 days and we fear the worst,' said Gough. She added that a number of cases they were working on under the Homes for Ukraine scheme had ended up with the children involved being trafficked as they waited for permission to travel to the UK. 'There is lots of trafficking, lots of children going missing. People that we were in touch we have subsequently heard from their friends that they have been trafficked,' said Gough. Sponsor Ginny Macbeth, from Wivenhoe, Kent, said that she had heard of cases where Ukrainians had become angry with UK homeowners following weeks of delay, not realising the British government was to blame. 'They are assuming they have messed it up,' she said. Macbeth revealed that of the family of five Ukrainians she was hoping to help, four had received visas except their middle child, aged four. The parents, film-makers who run an international human rights documentary film festival, fled Kyiv with their children when their street was shelled and are now in Bucharest, Romania. The government said: 'Thanks to the generosity of the public who have offered their homes to Ukrainians fleeing the war and through our Ukraine Family Scheme, more than 86,000 visas have been granted with over 27,000 Ukrainians arriving safely in the UK. 'We are processing thousands of visas a day - this shows the changes we made to streamline the service are working and we'll continue to build on this success so we can speed up the process even further.'", "542787dc6ee8fcd98e09d0fd576e8b5c69de100edd2affc5b6c96373": "It started with an extraordinary tale of wartime bravery and led to the publication of a bestselling account, The Man Who Broke Into Auschwitz, and to a BBC documentary. Then the difficult questions began. Were the heroic exploits of Denis Avey really all they seemed? Was his dramatic claim he had swapped places with a man inside a concentration camp possibly a fake? In spite of growing doubts, Avey's story that he saved the life of a Jewish prisoner by placing himself in danger while he was being held in a prisoner-of-war sub-camp near Auschwitz is still in popular currency. But now a dogged historical researcher, working to document the history of the German POW camps and concentration camps in Poland, is demanding the return of the price he paid for his copy of Avey's 2011 autobiography and suggesting that other readers do the same. The story laid out by Avey is full of holes, according to the British-Israeli researcher Alon Shapira, and therefore damaging to the integrity of Holocaust history. This weekend the Observer has learned that Hodder & Stoughton, publisher of The Man Who Broke Into Auschwitz, plans to include qualifying notes in any future edition of the influential book, which remains in print. The move would follow a decision recently taken by the Holocaust Education Trust to dissociate itself from the flawed historical narrative it contains of Avey's incarceration as a POW in Poland. This is despite the fact the organisation originally put forward Avey's name for the honour of being named a British Hero of the Holocaust. In a statement to the Observer this weekend, the trust said: 'Upholding the truth and integrity of the Holocaust is vital, and when new information comes to light it must be taken seriously.' The Imperial War Museum, which first interviewed the late Avey about his wartime experiences, has also distanced itself from the story of this Englishman, who was certainly held nearby as a POW, and who then claimed to have briefly switched identities with a Jewish camp inmate in order to help him and to verify the horrors committed inside. The museum's file containing Avey's testimony has now been flagged with a public warning. 'This story needs to be corrected as soon as possible by the publishers so that the real facts can be passed on to the next generation,' said Shapira. James Long, a British author who knew Avey before his death seven years ago and who helped research the original book, is now also keen for the next edition to contain a full acknowledgment of the questions and doubts since raised about Avey's memories. 'I would like to provide more of the background information and include some of the questions that have been raised since,' he said. But Shapira's discoveries of a series of discrepancies in Avey's story have now mounted up into a big potential problem for Hodder & Stoughton. While wartime memories are likely to become confused for any survivor, the accumulation of conflicting detail and changes to Avey's recollections are now impossible to ignore. First, a similar account of a prisoner swap with a camp internee was originally printed in a book called The Password Is Courage, about the mysterious and not always trustworthy wartime character, Charles Coward. This narrative also uses the phrase 'the man who broke into Auschwitz'. Avey's defenders, among them Long, argue that Coward may actually have appropriated the story of Avey's brave mission, rather than the other way around. Second, Avey initially told the Imperial War Museum that he had swapped with a Birkenau prisoner called Ernst. He later changed the location of the camp to a factory worker site and the identity of the Jewish camp survivor to a man called Hans, who has never been traced. It is possible, the publisher's researchers have argued, that Avey innocently mixed up the location of the work camps next to his POW camp with the infamous death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, which was several miles away. Among other conflicting assertions to have come to light, Avey also failed to mention that his father, who lived until 1960, was with him in his POW camp. In the book, Avey specifically said he had no knowledge of his father's wartime experiences, as the two had never discussed them. 'I don't think he ever knew that I had been in a camp near Auschwitz,' Avey wrote. Now Shapira has produced a German POW record for Avey's father, seen by the Observer, that shows he spent time in the same prison as his son, a facility known as E715. Those protective of Avey's reputation point out they believe there were between 800 and 1,000 prisoners in E715 and that it might still have been possible for father and son to have been in different buildings. Shapira's argument that a battered photograph of POWs that appears to show father and son together is not conclusive, they argue. The publisher's new plan to consider adding amendments and contextual notes of queries and doubts to Avey's account, which was written with journalist Rob Broomby, comes after an official response from Hodder & Stoughton last week that said it stood by Avey's original account. 'We have no reason to question the veracity of Denis Avey's book, The Man Who Broke Into Auschwitz,' it reads. Referring to previous attempts to question the facts in the autobiography, the response continues: 'Avey and his father were not in the same prison camp, E715, as the book makes completely clear,' and it concludes, 'Denis Avey's book is not in any way based on or derived from the Charles Coward book.'", "de0825c85e9386e761dad3dc218fa68c71bbbeb32dc3a90d609df525": "The family of Hotel Rwanda hero Paul Rusesabagina has filed a $400m lawsuit in the US over his alleged abduction and torture. Rusesabagina is serving a 25-year prison term on terrorism charges after a trial his supporters say was a sham and riddled with irregularities. 'The complaint alleges that the government of Rwanda and high-ranking Rwandan officials conspired to facilitate and execute an elaborate plot to lure Paul Rusesabagina from his home in Texas to Rwanda, where he would be tortured and illegally detained for the remainder of his life,' the family and his lawyers said in a statement on Saturday. A copy of the lawsuit seen by AFP indicates that it was filed in a Washington DC court on 22 February. It was served on the Rwandan government on 8 March. Rusesabagina's family and lawyers will hold a press conference in Washington on Wednesday to announce further details of the suit, which is seeking at least $400m in compensation as well as punitive damages. The lawsuit names the government of Rwanda, its president, Paul Kagame, and other figures including the former justice minister and intelligence chief. Rusesabagina, then a Kigali hotel manager, is credited with saving hundreds of lives during the 1994 genocide and his actions inspired the Hollywood film Hotel Rwanda. He used his fame to denounce Kagame as a dictator and has been behind bars since his arrest in August 2020, when a plane he believed was bound for Burundi landed instead in Kigali. The family statement said Rusesabagina, who has a US green card as well as Belgian citizenship, was tricked into travelling from his US home with the promise of work in Burundi. 'Instead, he was drugged and taken to Rwanda, where president Paul Kagame's security agents forcibly abducted him, tortured him, and forced him into illegal imprisonment.' The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rusesabagina was convicted in September of involvement in a rebel group blamed for deadly gun, grenade and arson attacks in Rwanda in 2018 and 2019. His 25-year jail term was upheld by Rwanda's court of appeal earlier this month, a ruling his family says is effectively a death sentence for the ailing 67-year-old.", "65de24f79db707e23bda8135713b0e8a1239689ceb8231325b49c365": "A culture of misogyny and harassment in parliament has been worsened by the government's repeated attempts to delay disciplinary action against misbehaving Tory MPs, Keir Starmer has argued, saying that 'a fish rots from the head'. Starmer said real change had to be 'led and modelled from the top' when asked about new claims of abusive and sexualised behaviour by MPs following the resignation of the Conservative backbencher Neil Parish for watching pornography in the Commons chamber. The Labour leader said the instinct of Downing Street in a series of previous misconduct cases had been either to try to ignore the issue or to delay any robust action. 'What we have seen from this government, time and again, is when one of their own gets into a difficulty, into a problem, they've done something they shouldn't have done, whether it's Owen Paterson, whether it's the Wakefield MP [Imran Ahmad Khan], or Neil Parish, their first instinct is to push it off into the long grass, hide what's happening,' Starmer told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday show. 'That is a political problem, because a fish rots from the head, and there needs to be political leadership on this as well. And we haven't seen that yet from the Conservative party.' Speaking earlier on the show, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, rejected the idea that there was a wider issue about standards in Westminster. 'I don't think there's a culture of misogyny,' he said. 'I think the problem we have is that people are working in a really intense environment. There are long hours, and I think generally, most people know their limits, they know how to act respectfully. 'But there are some instances where people don't, frankly, act according to the highest standards.' Starmer rejected this, saying: 'Those who are engaged in this sort of activity, whether it's comments about Angela Rayner or watching porn in the House of Commons, have to take responsibility.' However, neither Starmer nor Kwarteng had any specific suggestions on how matters could be improved, beyond agreeing that one possibility could be a suggestion by the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to end the current system by which MPs employ their staff directly. Kwarteng rejected the idea of all-female shortlists to improve the gender balance of Conservative MPs, saying he had 'never been a fan of quotas'. He also rejected the idea of closing bars in parliament: 'No, they shouldn't all be shut, I don't think we should have an excessively puritanical severe regime in that regard.' Also speaking on the Ridge show, the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said that as well as examining Hoyle's idea for the employment of MPs staff, the existing independent complaints system for parliamentary workers should be speeded up. Hoyle's idea would mark a significant overhaul of working practices in Westminster. Writing in the Observer, Hoyle said: 'I believe it is time we reviewed our working practices, and particularly whether it is right that individual MPs are the employers of their staff. Should someone else - or an outside body - employ the staff, as long as the MP has the right to choose them? 'In my opinion, it is time to consider radical action, and review structures and processes that could make a difference. Some serious allegations have been made, and we must address them as a matter of urgency. It is imperative we do the right thing by staff and MPs as well.'", "2dbcef09e84e8d557fe19f76f945e589aac7ca8421c221759cfcfe81": "The war in Ukraine will not affect the timing of a second independence referendum, Nicola Sturgeon has said, as she refused to rule out court action after Scotland's information commissioner ordered her government to publish its legal advice on holding a second poll. The Scottish National party leader and first minister also challenged the UK government to take a four nations approach to mitigating the cost of living crisis, just as happened during the pandemic. Amid growing fears that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will continue into next year, Sturgeon said: 'I've not changed my position on the timescale we won the mandate for in the election last year.' Sturgeon was speaking on board the SNP's canary yellow campaign bus after knocking on doors around Glasgow with candidates for this Thursday's council elections. The party's local manifesto includes a reiteration of its 2021 Holyrood election commitment to hold a second independence referendum by the end of 2023. There has been increasing speculation that the ongoing war in Europe could impact this timetable, and that the party's stance on a Trident-free independent Scotland is out of step with public mood at a time of international conflict. Sturgeon acknowledged that 'everybody in the European Union is fundamentally rethinking defence and security' but insists this does not amount to the need for a more flexible policy around nuclear weapons post-independence. 'My party is very strongly in principle and for practical reasons against nuclear weapons, and that's not going to change. We've got to remember that the vast majority of countries in the world don't have nuclear weapons.' The question of Nato membership has divided nationalist opinion - the SNP changed policy in 2012 to remaining within the alliance if Scotland becomes independent, prompting the resignation of 3 MSPs. Sturgeon said her party has to be 'much more engaged' in the question of what an independent Scotland would bring to Nato. 'What would be the specialisms and the expertise that we could put on the table, to be a much more constructive partner in that security alliance?' Last week, Scotland's information commissioner ordered Sturgeon's government to publish its legal advice on whether it would have the requisite powers to hold a second referendum without Westminster's consent - which Boris Johnson has consistently refused - after a lengthy FoI battle with the Scotsman. Are ministers planning to publish that information or challenge the ruling in court? 'The Commissioner's made his ruling, there's now a 10 Junedeadline, any government is going to carefully consider all aspects of that and I'm not going to pre-empt that consideration,' said Sturgeon. 'The question is not whether the Scottish government will comply with the law. We will. The question is whether political opponents and actually democrats are willing to argue their case democratically and allow the people to decide'. The SNP, the largest party of local government and now in power at Holyrood for 15 years, is facing serious challenges to its reputation for competence, including delays and mismanagement of vital ferry services and soaring NHS waiting times while there has been outcry at funding cuts handed down to local services following the latest Scottish budget. But latest polling suggests that the party will maintain its dominance, although the latest Panelbase tracker for the Sunday Times has support for the party down six points since last November. Scottish Labour is expected to push the Conservatives into third place, as pro-union voters react to Partygate. But with the constitution continuing to steer voter choice, elections expert Sir John Curtice has pointed out that every poll in Scotland is a 'quasi-referendum'. 'The anger about Partygate, feeding into and being fed by the anger and genuine distress people are feeling about the cost of living is palpable,' said Sturgeon. She was dismissive of the latest comments by Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross that Johnson was 'fit for office', despite previously calling for the prime minister to resign. 'He got, rightly, some credit for doing that - not easy within his own party - but then to make the U-turn he's made and now argue against all evidence to the contrary that Boris Johnson is actually fit to be prime minister, makes him look unprincipled, inconsistent, lacking resolve and a bit silly.' At her party's council manifesto launch, Sturgeon promised a 'pandemic-level' response to the cost of living crisis, highlighting the doubling of the new weekly child payment for low income families, the council tax reduction scheme and efforts to reduce fuel poverty. Now she is calling for a concerted four-nations effort, as happened throughout the Covid crisis, a point she says she raised last week with Michael Gove. 'Inevitably that has to involve much more action on the part of the UK government because most of the resources and levers do lie there ... I suggested we haven't proper four nations discussion with actual proposals on the table from all four nations with the Treasury there, properly engaged.' Scotland elects councillors by proportional representation, making coalitions and minority administrations the norm, but Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has ruled out deals with other parties. 'What that says to me,' she said, 'is that Anas Sarwar is a politician deep in opposition mindset, that he is not somebody who is yet anywhere close to thinking about what it means to be in power and take responsibility'. 'In an STV election, if you have that position then you're effectively freezing yourself in opposition.'", "e1b542f5cb80976a2fa3c2eb914d7d045c98e853f4b7aeebbf11a3fa": "", "c521b8f72ee9ffef237eafe8a6842c481edadf3d08e7309113e5023f": "", "6cd2bb70562b3c806d8600cabcf55a22d48872e0997088614f00f226": "If Stephen Smartt gets lucky, he may one day receive a message that will give the astrophysicist an advance warning that one of the most extraordinary displays known to science is about to light up the night sky. Signals relayed by automated telescope arrays and underground detectors will reveal that a star in our galactic neighbourhood has just turned supernova. A supernova occurs when a star destroys itself so completely it can outshine the combined light of an entire galaxy. In the last thousand years, only five have ever been visible to the naked eye. Ironically, all occurred before the invention of the telescope. 'We know about supernovae from their appearance in other galaxies and from remnants left behind in our own galaxy,' says Smartt, an astrophysicist based at Queen's University Belfast. 'But what we would love to do is see one that appears fairly near us so we can study it with modern telescopes and detectors.' When a supernova erupts, it sprays the cosmos with heavy elements - so observing one nearby would provide precious information about the creation of matter in our galaxy. 'Most elements heavier than oxygen were created in a supernova before being hurled across space,' says Prof Mark Sullivan of the University of Southampton. 'These atoms provide the galaxy with material essential to life. The calcium in your bones and the iron in your blood - as well as the gold in the ring on your finger - were all created in supernovae explosions.' It is an image that continues to entrance writers and artists. In Jeanette Winterson's words, astronomers have shown our first true parent was actually a star and that we are made of elements that are 'the long-lived radioactive nuclear waste of the supernova bang'. Or, as Joni Mitchell put it, more simply: 'We are stardust.' The most common type of supernova occurs when a very large star runs out of fuel, halting the nuclear fusion process that keeps it shining. The star's outer layers fall inwards, and protons and electrons are crushed together to form neutrons that become packed into a superdense ball. Matter continues to rain down on this neutron ball before bouncing back, triggering a shock wave that destroys the star. All that is left behind is a neutron sphere that is so dense a matchbox of it would weigh about 3bn tonnes. And if the original progenitor star that led to the supernova was particularly large, this neutron star will become so heavy it will form a black hole from which nothing can escape, not even light. This is a core-collapse supernova and it can unleash more energy than our sun will release over its entire 10bn-year lifetime. If a star in our galaxy, too distant to be seen by the naked eye on Earth, becomes a supernova, it will suddenly shine so brilliantly it could be seen in daylight. Scientists estimate that on average about 20 supernovae occur in a galaxy such as ours every thousand years. Yet only five have been observed in the last millennium. East Asian and Arabic records indicate there were supernovae in 1006, 1054 and 1181, while European documents recall ones that occurred in 1572 and 1604. The first of this last pair flashed into sight in November 1572 and was observed by the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe. 'Overhead, a certain strange star was suddenly seen, flashing its light with a radiant gleam,' he recalled. 'I stood still, gazing ... When I had satisfied myself that no star of that kind had ever shone forth before, I was led into such perplexity by the unbelievability of the thing that I began to doubt the faith of my own eyes.' But if supernovae are so brilliant, why have we only detected five in the past 1,000 years? Why have we not seen a number that is nearer the 20 suggested by observations of other galaxies? The answer is straightforward, says Sullivan. 'Our galaxy is like a flat plate and our solar system is about two-thirds of the way towards its edge. A supernova that occurs on the other side of the plate will simply be obscured by all the dust and stars that lie at the centre of the galaxy.' Astronomers have since observed supernovae in other galaxies and studied remnants of those that have occurred inside our galaxy. These include the glowing filaments of the Crab Nebula, the remains of the supernova that lit up night skies in 1054AD and which have since been spreading across space. Galactic debris such as this reveals the enormous destruction that is unleashed by supernovae. Yet these stellar convulsions are also important engines of creation, scientists argue. Apart from spraying the cosmos with heavy elements on which life depends, they also play a key role in planet and star formation, says astrophysicist Cosimo Inserra of Cardiff University. 'A supernova sends shock waves across a galaxy and these strike clouds of gas and dust in space, compressing them so that proto-stars start to form at their centres. Eventually, nuclear fusion begins, igniting a star's store of hydrogen and it starts to shine. Planets form and orbit the star. That is probably how our sun and solar system came into existence.' Supernovae do pose threats, nevertheless. 'If one occurred within 20 parsecs - roughly 60 light years - of the Earth, its intense cosmic rays could destroy our protective ozone layer, which would allow increased levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun to reach us,' says Sullivan. However, only one very close to Earth could have such an impact and at present there are no candidate stars near us that look ready to annihilate themselves this way, he adds. On the other hand, it is also clear supernovae have exploded near Earth in the past. As evidence, scientists point to the discovery of a radioactive isotope of iron - known as iron-60 - that has been found in seabed deposits laid down 2.5m years ago and in other deposits created about 7m years ago. Iron-60 is produced by supernovae and these deposits suggest at least two must have erupted near Earth within the last 10m years, probably at a distance of about 100 parsecs, or 320 light years. What impact that had on the planet is uncertain. 'You might have had a rise in cosmic-ray activity and this might have affected cloud formation on Earth or reduced the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground,' says Prof John Ellis of King's College London. 'This could then have triggered a change in the climate, which in turn could have affected the course of human evolution.' Apart from the rather startling prospect that the appearance of Homo sapiens might have been shaped by local supernovae, these discoveries also suggest there might have been enough of them to have had a real influence on life earlier in our planet's history. 'If you find two that happened fairly near Earth within the past 10m years, that suggests hundreds must have appeared over the past billion years,' argues Ellis. 'Some of them will have been quite distant ... but a few would have been close, say 10 parsecs away. And we should be clear: if a supernova went off within 10 parsecs of our planet, it would very likely have caused a mass extinction.' Earth has experienced at least five mass extinctions that have each eradicated thousands of species of animals, plants and sea creatures, and at least one of these was caused by an extraterrestrial agent: an asteroid that struck Earth at the end of the Cretaceous period 66m years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs. Earth-based catastrophes - such as large-scale volcanism - have been blamed for the other mass extinctions. However, scientists now suspect that in one other case, an otherworldly event was to blame. They point to rocks that formed at the end of the Devonian period 360m years ago when there was another mass extinction that wiped out ammonites, trilobites and other early forms of life. These rocks contain hundreds of thousands of generations of plant spores that appear to be sunburnt by ultraviolet light - evidence of a long-lasting ozone-depletion event, says astronomer Brian Fields at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 'We propose that one or more supernova explosions, about 65 light years from Earth, could have been responsible for the protracted loss of ozone,' he argues. This blast would have first bathed Earth with powerful X-rays and gamma rays before debris from the blast slammed into the planet, stripping it of its protective ozone layer. This astronomical double whammy would have exposed the planet's surface to deadly radiation for up to 100,000 years and led to a mass extinction. Further proof for this idea is now being sought by scientists. They have discounted looking for iron-60 atoms because these decay too quickly to have survived the 360m years since the late Devonian mass extinction. Instead, they plan to seek out atoms of the isotope plutonium-244, which is also produced by supernovae and could survive for a few hundred million years. That research is now under way. In the meantime, scientists are preparing themselves to react as speedily as possible to the first signs that a nearby supernova has begun. Crucially, these first signals will not come flashes of light but will emerge from underground detectors designed to spot the universe's most insignificant entity, the neutrino. 'Neutrinos are the first thing that will emerge from a supernova,' says Smartt. 'They are so insubstantial, they are very difficult to detect and instruments have to be put in places where they do not pick up spurious signals from other sources. 'However, if enough are detected, then an automated alert will be sent out and the arrays of telescopes that we use to study the night sky will be turned towards the sources of those neutrinos. Then we will be ready to study the first bursts of radiation and light emerging from the supernova and to watch how it unfolds.' While scientists are confident a supernova will occur in 2022, whether it occurs in our galaxy is a different matter. In any given year, it is an unlikely prospect. On the other hand, one day it may just happen in our galactic neighbourhood. If it does, astronomers say they will be ready.", "89d68163e7fe4155b9557574d953286cb825397c6733ec4bbd279444": "On the streets of Enniskillen, a handful of twentysomething women, all from a unionist background, discuss this week's elections. The Northern Ireland protocol does not come up once, but what does surface repeatedly among 18- to 34-year-olds asked open questions about their voting intentions is the frustration with the framing of this election, like many before it, as a vote on the constitutional question of whether Northern Ireland should remain part of the UK or unify with Ireland. 'It's the scaremongering I don't like. People telling you you have to vote DUP to keep the other side out,' says one 25-year-old worker who wanted to remain anonymous. 'I'm a unionist, but I'm not going to be influenced by that protocol stuff. What's important for me is the health stuff. You have to stand up for women's issues, that's important,' she adds, shorthand for why she is not voting for the DUP. 'To be honest I think all the parties have let everyone down. I've been waiting for two weeks just to get an appointment with the GP,' she says. She is a 'from a unionist background' but voted remain and says she will probably vote for the Ulster Unionist party because of 'things like abortion and women's issues'. She has no interest in the constitutional question and the tribal voting. 'Until people stop viewing things as unionist or nationals, Northern Ireland will never change,' she says. The Enniskillen straw poll shows that young people, who have no memory of the Troubles, yearn for a day when polarised nationalist-versus-unionist arguments, which polls show are popular with older voters, are over. 'I was brought up a Protestant but I'm not really that influenced by that. Me and my siblings will vote for progression rather than religion,' says her friend. Down the street are young parents Grace Hoy, a primary school teacher who is looking at voting for the Green party, and her physiotherapist husband, Mark, who is looking at an independent 'cross community' candidate, Donal O'Cofaigh. 'It's just a bit of a circus this election,' says Grace, 27. 'People focus too much on stopping the other side getting in. I'm not voting for people who want to bicker or fight over these silly issues. 'The issues for me are healthcare, the lack of childcare, support for young families.' Away from the headline battles between Sinn Fein and the DUP and the turmoil within unionism, the question for post-conflict Northern Ireland is whether constitutional politics will ever be remote enough to be in the rear-view mirror. A LucidTalk poll for the Belfast Telegraph in March put the combined support for the Alliance party, the Green party and other non-aligned rivals such as People Before Profit at 24%, with their most recent survey results on Friday showing a slight fall to 21%. It is a sizeable chunk compared with Sinn Fein at 26% and the DUP at 20%, according to the poll commissioned by the Belfast Telegraph, but is it enough? The Alliance party will be the sanctuary for many votes eschewing the constitutional political positioning of the main parties, with some predicting they could add between three and five seats to their existing eight. It will mean a larger presence in Stormont, but with 90 seats to be taken it will still be a minority. 'This is not going to be the election where people cross the Rubicon in significant numbers,' says Peter Shirlow, director of the Institute of Irish studies at the University of Liverpool. 'People say they're fed up, say they want it all to stop. They don't want the election to be about the legacy, they want the end to arguing, they want a different assembly, but the thing about it is, most of the people who feel that way is they don't vote.' However, he believes the proportional representation system could deliver some results for those in the middle. 'What we are seeing is there is a growth for those non-constitutional parties, but where they're very strong is in second preferences. That could theoretically be a gamechanger,' he says. Launching the Alliance party's manifesto last week, Naomi Long, its leader, expressed frustration that those who support the non-aligned parties do not have the same voice as the unionists and nationalists because of the consociational system set up for post-conflict powersharing. She said she wanted an end to the system whereby members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) are designated as unionist, nationalist or other. 'About 15% of MLAs currently are non-aligned in the assembly, yet we still count for less in votes on key issues. We cannot say that our community are all equal if within the heart of the institutions which govern this place there is inequality and disrespect for people's rights. 'I believe that the days of designations are over. The Good Friday agreement allowed us an opportunity to manage our divisions, but surely as a society that cannot be the ceiling of our ambitions.'", "29a8edd4ebdbe124b6f8bc35e3d3855e6f7d7a5ce4954e1f355ae500": "", "5bf05ccb915eebcb1f0bead25bf250cbe896db9a33e3b2799df5de08": "", "b0a19cb72166807976a6e75ad9e54d7186dd23126ce7e8f119e325a5": "", "e5bd528fa662523cb15a6579f655eb4a73efebff63b28ec249403013": "", "e151922e0fa44d28debedb130d73e6651792d5cbac2a2e1a7e5c031b": "", "2f0b1b149f71ca3ee8173a33690ca320f74661b9221b12e687c54280": "", "b0abe2444cd8707f063786a75dffd60b57235e7a51a382580316d49b": "", "46059ef9dfd30a55a304863c8f0a463fa89e02801f64d0dad9963cb7": "", "c290446afbd26dedddb88725740df8d0b06aef80307537894bdae212": "", "5112f866199413202a39e796f2734bd819484d5b40d9c81846386948": "", "4c5b3400a498f23feceb772cdc54fab8ecb54383bc4e43a63f696c03": "Ministers are under increasing pressure to help free a retired British geologist at risk of facing the death penalty in Iraq over smuggling allegations. A petition urging the release of father-of-two Jim Fitton, 66, has received more than 95,000 signatures in the three days since it was launched. His daughter Leila and her husband, Sam Tasker, from Bath, in Somerset, have also disclosed the sentencing this month is expected to coincide with a long-planned celebration of their wedding. They said: 'There is never a good time for something like this to happen but we are one week away from what should be the happiest day of our lives, and the culmination of more than two years of planning, and it's been turned into an absolute living nightmare. 'We have accepted the fact that, without timely intervention from the FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office), Jim will be unable to attend this ceremony too.' Fitton has been detained in Iraq for five weeks after being accused of attempting to smuggle historic artefacts out of the country. His family said Fitton collected stones and shards of broken pottery as souvenirs while visiting a site in Eridu, in the country's south-east, as part of an organised geology and archaeology tour. But they added that the items were judged to be artefacts under Iraqi law and the charge levelled at Fitton states 'whoever exported or intended to export, deliberately, an antiquity, from Iraq, shall be punishable with execution'. His case in connection with the March incident is expected to go for sentencing in the week beginning 8 May. Fitton's family described the response to the petition as 'unbelievable', adding in a statement: 'Jim really appreciates the support from old colleagues, good friends, kindred spirits, and complete strangers who have not allowed this to go unnoticed. 'We will continue to fight while we continue to have you at our backs.' Fitton worked as a geologist for oil and gas companies during his career and lives in his adopted home of Malaysia with his wife, Sarijah. Wera Hobhouse, Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, has raised his case with ministers in the House of Commons. The family said their lawyer has drafted a proposal under Iraqi law to have the case closed before trial but they need the Foreign Office to 'put their weight behind the plan and endorse it' so they can secure a high-level meeting with judicial officials in the country. The proposal cites the 'clear lack of criminality, that Jim is a victim of poor guidance and circumstance, and also cites the huge investment that the UK has made in the Iraqi governmental and judicial framework through FCDO funding in the past few years'. The family statement, via an update on the petition website, also explained: 'Leila has not seen Jim for more than two years due to Covid travel restrictions. 'We held a small Covid wedding ceremony in Bath in August of last year for close friends and our British family members, mostly on my side. 'We have, since then, been planning a larger celebration in Malaysia with all of Leila's extended family. 'This is scheduled on 8 May. Obviously there is never a good time for something like this to happen but we are one week away from what should be the happiest day of our lives, and the culmination of more than two years of planning, and it's been turned into an absolute living nightmare.' The Foreign Office said it was providing consular support and was in contact with the local authorities. Foreign Office minister Amanda Milling, in a letter to Hobhouse, said last week: 'We understand the urgency of the case, and have already raised our concerns with the Iraqi authorities regarding the possible imposition of the death penalty in Mr Fitton's case and the UK's opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle.'", "a07c717ce54761966304aca8ccf43d46f693229ea217f34d9791cb89": "The market town of Tiverton, which became prosperous in the 16th and 17th centuries thanks to its thriving wool trade, is usually a tranquil kind of place. But it was an uncomfortable spot to be on Saturday as townsfolk digested the news that their MP, Neil Parish, was under investigation for allegedly watching pornography in the House of Commons. 'It's a disgrace,' said Peter Moore, 74, a retired engineer who has lived in Devon all his life ('apart from six years serving in the county regiment'). 'Of course he should resign. People used to fall on their swords but they don't now. He should resign - and Boris Johnson should resign. It's Trumpism, people don't care now. There used to be honour, there's no honour now, apart from honour among thieves.' Paul Graham, 54, a former mayor of Tiverton, heard Moore talking and couldn't resist stopping and leaping in, with a different take. 'In this country, we're innocent until proven guilty,' he said. Graham, who works in manufacturing, warmed to his theme. 'It's upsetting for the town but we don't want a byelection. I've voted for Neil three times and I'll vote for him next time if I get the chance.' He won't. By the afternoon, Parish had resigned. 'The situation was that - funnily enough it was tractors I was looking at' he told the BBC. 'I did get into another website that had a very similar name and I watched it for a bit which I shouldn't have done. But my crime - biggest crime - is that on another occasion I went in a second time.' This weekend, the story about Parish watching porn in the Commons is the latest 'off grid' disaster to hit Boris Johnson and the Tories, with just four days to go until crucial local elections. If the Conservatives do badly on Thursday many of Parish's former colleagues could be tempted to submit letters of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady calling on Johnson to go, triggering what could be the beginning of the end for the prime minister. The West Country was already looking difficult enough for Johnson as Partygate, the cost of living crisis, and other Tory sleaze scandals made his campaign claims to be just 'getting on with the job' and 'delivering for the British people' ring rather hollow. On Friday on the rural north-eastern fringes Taunton in Somerset, where desperately needed new housing is spreading around meadows, cricket fields and old cider orchards, there was little enthusiasm for the Tory offer. Kim Linden, 57, a hairdresser, said she would be switching to the Lib Dems in Thursday's local elections. '[The Tories] don't tell the truth. [Boris Johnson] said 'No we didn't have parties' but they did have parties,' she says, while being canvassed by the Lib Dems, on one of the sprawling, new-build estates. 'And it's not just that: everything is rising. Bills. Gas. Electric. Fuel. And they are not helping us. They are not putting anything in place for the future.' Other long-term Conservative voters on the private development were having doubts too. Their concerns are bad news for Johnson because the Lib Dems are eyeing a big comeback across large parts of the south-west and Tory-run Somerset county council is a key target. Dave Cardy, 52, a former police officer who now delivers prescriptions, said he had had enough of Johnson. 'I thought he would become a sensible prime minister. But he has just carried on bumbling his way through life. Really, we need a grown-up in charge - Boris's time is done,' he said. Look north, and similar views were being expressed on Friday behind the 'red wall' that Johnson and his party breached with devastating effect at the 2019 general election. Results in councils such as Kirklees, which takes in Huddersfield, will be scrutinised as Labour seeks to win back control. Across the council area views are still mixed on the Labour leader Keir Starmer's appeal and it is by no means all going his way. But there are some signs that opinion is slowly shifting in Labour's direction. A hairdresser in Birstall, who asked not to be named, said she doesn't see a way back for Johnson, because he was 'completely guilty and knew what he was doing'. She added: 'If you've lied about something then there's always going to be mistrust.' Georgina Marshall, who switched from Labour to the Conservatives at the last general election was dismayed by Johnson for very personal reasons. 'He carries on and carries on. I had a Christmas where I couldn't see my mum; I didn't see my 90-year-old grandma for two years. Meanwhile he's partying with all his friends.' Labour could retake Kirklees council by gaining just three of the 23 seats up for election, after it slipped into no overall control following three defections in 2020. But failure to do so will be seen as evidence that the red wall will be stubbornly difficult to reconquer. Millions of voters will go to the polls across the UK on Thursday, with 6,800 seats being contested, including all council seats in Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland the first elections to the assembly will be held since the UK's withdrawal from the EU. In England elections will take place in all London boroughs, 33 of 36 metropolitan boroughs, 60 out of 181 district councils, and 21 of 58 unitary authorities. Inevitably Labour, which did well when most of these seats were last contested in 2018, is downplaying its chances both regionally and nationally. Labour activists are pouring cold water on the idea of their party conquering the Tory strongholds of both Wandsworth and Westminster in London, while the Tories are saying Starmer's party should make huge gains at this point in the electoral cycle. Back in Tiverton, there was dismay that the quiet had been disturbed for all the wrong reasons - and a weary sense that under Johnson and his team it would never end. Katy Oakley, 40, an ecologist, was walking through the town with her four-year-old daughter, Olive. 'This sums up what everybody thinks about the government, another shocking incident in a long line. 'I think it shows just how out of touch members of the elite are with normal society. They think they can get away with things that ordinary people couldn't. 'This isn't brilliant publicity for our town - it puts Tiverton in a bad light. It's not good for the country's image abroad. And it's not good for society.' Though he lives on his farm across the border in Somerset, Parish is a well-known figure in Tiverton. He was first elected 12 years ago and since then has doubled his majority. The North Devon Tory MP, Selaine Saxby, said Parish had always been a loyal and supportive colleague. But she expressed shock: 'Nobody wants to think of their MP sat on the green benches watching videos full stop, certainly not this kind of video.' Happily for the Tories on Mid Devon district council, which is based in Tiverton, councillors are not up for election this spring. 'I guess that's a good thing,' said Ray Radford, a senior Conservative currently serving as the chairman of the council. At the indoor market, Jane Hall, 56, summed up much of the anger. 'When people are scrimping and scraping, he's sat there apparently watching porn. He should be sacked but he's got Boris as his role model. He was having a party when people were dying.'", "6568bac3f5e7ef4f0e63763adfb26d86abb36c0e6106fe8c17f7a7aa": "When police in Washington DC burst into a fifth-floor apartment building on 22 April in search of a man who allegedly had shot four people at random, they found Raymond Spencer dead by his own hand, a cache of guns and ammunition, and a poster with an ironic white supremacist meme. The poster invoking the meme, popular on the extremist online forum 4chan, was a stark reminder that this attack blamed on Spencer, 23, was only the most recent mass casualty attack to spawn out of the ugly extremist culture of unregulated internet message boards such as 4chan. That particular forum gave birth to QAnon, the far-right conspiracy theory that Donald Trump is combating a cabal of leftist pedophiles, before it moved on to its even-more-extreme cousin 8chan. QAnon has been particularly effective in crafting the lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump, inspiring the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021. A bipartisan Senate committee connected seven deaths to the attack. Alek Minassian, 25, posted an update on Facebook with a direct reference to 4chan and its extreme misogynistic community of so-called incels, short for involuntary celibates, before launching a deadly vehicle ramming rampage in Toronto in 2018. And after New Zealand police arrested Brenton Tarrant, who shot and killed 51 worshippers in mosques in Christchurch, he cited 4chan and 8chan as direct influences. Seemingly by sheer luck, Spencer's recent attack in Washington was less costly in terms of lives. But it was still a stark reminder of how many online extremists and the movements with which they sympathize can trace their origins to either 4chan or 8chan, said Oren Segal, vice-president of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. 'The chans - 4chan, 8chan, etc - are some of the most vile places on the internet,' Segal told the Guardian. The trolling, humor, appeals to violence: it 'seeps outside the confines of the message boards,' he added. Spencer's case has chilling aspects. He fired 200 rounds from a makeshift sniper's nest, injuring a man, two women, and a 12-year-old girl. He had an additional 800 rounds stashed. Just two minutes after the shooting began, someone under the username 'Raymond Spencer' logged onto the normally-anonymous 4chan and started a new thread titled 'shool [sic] shooting'. The newly published message contained a link - to a 30-second video of images captured from the digital scope of Spencer's rifle. The clip streamed images and sounds of the barrage of bullets which slammed into cars and shattered windows at an adjacent school while also maiming four strangers. Even as police stormed the apartment building where Spencer hid, with officers maneuvering past a surveillance camera that he had set up in the hallway and was monitoring, Spencer continued to post to the message board. 'They're in the wrong part of the building right now searching,' he posted at one point. A few minutes later: 'Waiting for police to catch up with me.' As he waited, Spencer logged on to Wikipedia to edit the entry for Edmund Burke School, which he had just opened fire on. 'A basedman shot at the school on April 22, 2022,' the edit read, using a message board term derived from the word 'based,' which is 4chan slang for somebody who agrees to the board's warped worldview. 'The suspect is still at large.' Police believe Spencer shot himself to death as officers breached his apartment. Like those who have carried out other domestic terror attacks that rocked the US, Canada and New Zealand in recent years, Spencer situated his mass shooting in a tangle of ironic memes and 4chan in-jokes. On a poster hanging in the apartment where Spencer died was a cartoon of a Black man with an enlarged head. It's a deeply ironic reference to Nation of Islam theology - which holds that a Black scientist named Yakub created the white race more than 6,000 years ago. 4chan co-opted the concept more recently, caricaturing it along the way, to justify its own white supremacist philosophy. Anti-extremist groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center have warned for years that 4chan and 8chan would continue inspiring domestic terror attacks. Cassie Miller, a researcher at the center, analyzed a self-selected survey of users to a white supremacist webforum. She found nearly 25% reported that they considered themselves radicalized - or, in their terms, 'redpilled' - by the culture of 4chan and 8chan. It was tied for the single most-reported pathway to radicalization. While the far-right online ecosystem has grown significantly since then, the edgy humor and racist politics of 'chan' culture continue to prove influential, especially among younger users. The chans 'normalize the kinds of narratives and grievances that are dangerous', Segal said. They form a sort of 'cheering section' for violence. Even 8chan's founder, Frederick Brennan, has blamed the site for a rise in mass shootings and unsuccessfully called for it to be shut down. Brennan quit the site in 2016, leaving management to its new owners: Jim Watkins and his son Ron. The pair, who have since been identified as the likely puppet masters behind QAnon, have rejected more active moderation and have leveraged the site's extreme free speech ethos for their own political ends - Ron Watkins is currently running in a Republican congressional primary in Arizona. There are few good solutions on how to address the radicalizing influence of these forums, Segal said. Owners like Watkins have been unwilling to crack down on hate speech; whenever one web hosting company has removed them, another has stepped up; and law enforcement is simply ill-suited to monitor and investigate the deluge of hate on the platforms. It will take a 'whole-of-society approach', Segal said. 'Everything that normalizes hateful ideology ... needs to be addressed.'", "d180354f23e96c548257c670e39da281586f236605fcdb467e28f575": "Joe Biden celebrated the return of a flashy annual gathering of Washington's political and media elites on Saturday with some humorous jabs at Donald Trump - and himself. The US president, sporting a tuxedo and slightly askew bow tie, spoke at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, which was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. It was another tentative step towards Washington norms after Trump repeatedly snubbed the gala, which champions the freedom of the press. 'This is the first time the president has attended this dinner in six years,' Biden observed. 'It's understandable. We had a horrible plague - followed by two years of Covid.' That quip produced laughter. The next one elicited both laughter and groans: 'Just imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year. Now that would really have been a real coup if that occurred.' The gathering included the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and other cabinet members as well as journalists such as CNN's Jake Tapper and MSNBC's Joy Reid. Celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Pete Davidson, Brooke Shields and Caitlyn Jenner walked the red carpet. The three-course dinner took place in a vast, crowded hotel ballroom despite the long shadow cast by the pandemic. Biden, 79, skipped the meal with the 2,600 guests, all of whom had to provide proof of vaccination and a same-day negative test. The event was an opportunity for the president - or more precisely his speechwriters - to flex some comedy muscles at the expense of the media, the Republican party and his own ego. He began: 'A special thanks to the 42% of you who actually applauded. I'm really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower approval rating than I have.' The president made fun of the hypocrisy of conservative cable channel Fox News, which has required its own employees to be vaccinated or tested daily, even as its primetime hosts rail against Biden's vaccine mandates. 'I know there are questions about whether we should gather here tonight, because of Covid. Well, we're here to show the country that we're getting through this pandemic. Plus, everyone had to prove they're fully vaccinated and boosted. So if you're home watching this, and you're wondering how to do that, just contact your favourite Fox News reporter. They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them.' He also seized on recent revelations that Trump's White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Fox News's Sean Hannity exchanged more than 80 text messages between election day in 2020 and Biden's inauguration. 'Fox News, I'm really sorry your preferred candidate lost the last election. To make it up to you, I'm happy to give my chief of staff to you all so he can tell Sean Hannity what to say every day.' Perhaps the biggest laugh came when Biden made light of the 'Let's Go Brandon' slogan, which has become rightwing code for swearing at him. 'Republicans seem to support one fella, some guy named Brandon. He's having a really good year and I'm kind of happy for him.' When Biden shifted gear towards the end of his 14-minute speech to recognise the importance of journalism to American democracy, he again drew a contrast with his predecessor by insisting that a free press 'is not the enemy of the people'. 'Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,' Biden said. He added that 'American democracy is not a reality show' - seemingly another dig at Trump, former host of The Apprentice. In another restoration of tradition, the president was obliged to sit as he was roasted by a comedian. South African Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, told Biden: 'Thank you for having me here. And I was a little confused on why me, but then I was told that you get your highest approval ratings when a biracial African guy is standing next to you.' Noah also observed: 'Ever since you came into office, things are already looking up. Gas is up, rent is up, food is up, everything.' The comedian took swipes at media personalities and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis. He said of Kyrsten Sinema, a conservative Democratic senator who has helped to thwart much of Biden's legislative agenda: 'Who ever thought we'd see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican?' Noah wrapped up with a reference to Biden's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, telling the audience: 'Please be careful leaving tonight. We all know this administration doesn't handle evacuations well.' The black tie dinner had other serious moments, with tributes to pioneer journalists of colour and aspiring student reporters. A sombre photo montage honouring journalists killed while covering the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted a standing ovation. Chris Coons, a Democratic senator and Biden ally, told the Guardian: 'As it has always been in its best years in the past, this was an evening that was celebrating young journalists, celebrating seasoned journalists, celebrating pathbreaking journalists from a generation ago and mixed with a lot of humour, some hobnobbing, some celebrities. 'The president played exactly the role we would hope a president would: a little bit of light humour, a very serious tribute to the importance of a free press and then sitting and listening as others poked fun at him.'", "1c662ceb1e8e69d64a79783bc50a78a43f18ccf74e23c42f6f203955": "An overwhelming majority of people in the UK hold the 'woke' belief that it is important to be alive to issues of race and social justice, according to a new analysis of public attitudes. Four in five Britons believe in being attentive to those issues - the definition of 'woke' used by the Merriam-Webster dictionary - leading researchers to claim the country is not as divided by culture wars as is often assumed. An overwhelming majority of Conservative voters and those who backed Brexit also said it was important to be attentive to the issues. The report by the Global Future thinktank, using polling by YouGov, states that it is one of several areas in which there is more agreement in the UK than polarisation. It points to strong support for taking in more Ukrainian refugees (43%), including among Tory voters (30%), as well as support for wider restrictions on immigration. Only a tiny proportion of Remainers said they want totally open borders. When asked directly whether they thought they were 'woke', with no definition given, 16% said they were, 41% said they were not and 31% said they did not know what the term meant. Asked about their views on British history, 77% of people believe Britain has been a force for good in the world but that this does not equate to denying issues about the past. Some 67% also accept that Britain has done damage. A majority believe this across age, gender and region. While 74% of Conservatives acknowledge that damage has been done in Britain's past, 65% of Labour voters accept that Britain has also had a positive impact in the world. The findings have been supported by political figures attempting to stop political polarisation. 'This research reveals the decent, tolerant and ethical centre ground of the British people,' said Jon Cruddas, the Labour MP. 'We're proud of our history and we care deeply about racial and social injustice. Despite talk of polarisation, we still share a meaningful sense of the common good.' Jesse Norman, the Tory MP and former Treasury minister, said: 'What this research highlights is that, as a whole, people across the UK are both capable and comfortable in talking about complex questions of race and identity, and that they still hold firm to a centre ground of tolerance, decency and mutual respect.' The research was based on a YouGov poll conducted on 6-7 April. It polled 2,244 people online.", "422adad891eca17e08607b40fd9756d97fe0723981eebfeb43e63dc3": "", "fc71199564d3fb4b671ded1fff749314bad3ee7a533b2385a9ca7ea8": "Company directors fear the cost of living crisis and tumbling consumer confidence will cause greater harm than previously estimated, increasing the risk of an economic downturn this year, according to a major new study. The Institute of Directors (IoD) said in a survey last month that a lack of confidence in the economic outlook was 'the number one issue' facing British businesses as inflationary pressures combined with the uncertainty caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine to heighten the risk of a recession. A measure of business-leader optimism in the economy, the directors' economic confidence index fell to -36 in April from -4 in February. City analysts and economists have become increasingly concerned that the UK's rebound from the pandemic is quickly running out of steam following steep rises in the price of gas, electricity, petrol and food. Shortages of staff across industries such as IT, manufacturing, construction and hospitality are also forcing employers to pay signing-on fees, bonuses and higher wages to secure employees with the necessary skills. The Bank of England is expected to increase interest rates this week in response to a jump in inflation to 7% in March, adding further pressure on indebted businesses and households that rely on credit to make ends meet. Officials at the central bank will publish their latest forecasts for the economy, which are likely to show it contracting in the second quarter in response to a decline in household spending power. A separate study by the consultants EY-Parthenon revealed the number of profit warnings issued by UK-listed companies soared by 44% year on year in the first quarter of 2022, with a record number of firms citing rising costs for the weaker performance. The report found that UK-listed companies issued 72 warnings in the first three months of 2022 - the highest quarterly figure since the start of the pandemic. A record-breaking 43% of warnings was due to rising costs, up from 27% in Q4 2021 and well above the 2011-21 average of 10%. Alan Hudson, a partner at the firm, said: 'Inflationary pressures, which had been building throughout 2021, were already putting pressure on company margins and consumers' real incomes. 'The war in Ukraine has contributed to greater supply-side pressures and raised questions about confidence and demand in 2022. We are now looking at a year with ongoing Covid-19 disruption alongside higher inflation, greater uncertainty and faster monetary tightening than we expected just a few months ago.' Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the IoD, said the invasion of Ukraine had 'sent shock waves around British boardrooms'. She said some businesses were beginning to plan and consider new investments, but 'optimism in the UK economy itself remains very low and is now the number one issue seen as having a negative impact on businesses, even above the other very real pressures of high energy costs, difficulties in the labour market and problems with international supply chains'.", "a023be7abf31b81d8509eda4819eb830d16d138515d21fad476ea191": "", "b53e8b6c0b28be2daf68d90c51fe59702ac22114bd15e201e9150eb1": "", "1ed0f3ee04916bb7af5afa4a54c168e63e7c0f771d96f6c6a5b3889b": "", "d6a0f3fc13cc0dc0d7e83e7917c644c64b147809594a11ed59d41fe3": "", "cd25f5caeda9e3d3aa33f0b5aa3941833c7b65bab38213526efcf976": "Even through the haze of shimmering heat and thick Delhi dust, the mural is impossible to miss. Pinks, blues, greens and yellows pop off the wall, coming together to form a utopian scene of equality, and splashed across the middle is emblazoned a slogan designed to challenge India's male-dominated society. 'The future is femme,' it declares. The artwork stands at the entrance of this year's India art fair, the country's largest event showcasing Indian artists and galleries, which opens in Delhi this weekend after a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic. Its presence is significant. Aravani art collective, the artists behind the work, have never showcased in a major gallery, nor do they see themselves as a part of the money-driven art market, which exists mainly within the confines of white gallery walls. Aravani are India's only trans art collective, encompassing about 40 trans people - mainly women but some men - from cities across the country, who paint murals and artworks across public spaces. Metro stations, schools, universities, flyovers and carparks have been transformed by their artworks depicting scenes of inclusion and gender fluidity. The murals have brought visibility and empowerment to the trans community, who are still largely shunned and stigmatised in India and often forced to live on the fringes of society. 'In this mural we wanted to celebrate the intersectionality and inclusivity that has always existed within the trans community but is rarely visible in our society,' said Poornima Sukumar, who founded the collective in 2016. The decision to take part in the art fair was not an entirely comfortable one, said Sukumar, but one that she hoped would help shift perceptions and give them a platform to depict the multi-faceted nature of their collective and the trans community at large. 'It's important in our work to challenge that perception that everyone in the trans community is the same,' she said. 'Yes many have run away from home because of the pressures and have ended up doing begging or sex work because that was the only viable source of money, but within those experiences there are so many individual journeys.' For Mayuri Pujari, who has been part of the collective since 2017, the impact of her involvement has been profound. 'The visibility is empowering,' she said. 'People see the trans community as professionals making art, not just begging on the roads.' Among the new generation of young artists being showcased at this year's fair, which plays a pivotal role in India's flourishing art market, many have used their works to push boundaries around sexuality, gender and queer stories. In a specially commissioned performance piece for example, Gurjeet Singh, a celebrated young Sikh artist from a small village on the border with Pakistan, delicately questions and inverts traditional gender roles in families and in the home. For Jaya Asokan, director of the fair, the 'diversity and inclusion' widening India's art landscape, as well as growing international interest in the Indian art market, meant the fair was taking place at 'a turning point for Indian and south Asia art.' 'A lot of our artists have had regional appeal for a while but the narrative is shifting and now they are in demand internationally,' said Asokan. Certainly from a commercial side, things have never looked so good for the Indian modern art market. The pandemic provided an unexpected boost to sales and over the past two years; there whave been at least three record-setting sales of modern Indian art, including Amrita Sher-Gil's 1938 painting In the Ladies' Enclosure for $5.14m, the second-highest amount ever paid for a modern Indian artwork. 'I haven't seen a market as strong as this one since 2006, which lasted for a few years before the financial crisis,' said Dinesh Vazirani, the chief executive of Indian art auction house Saffronart. He credited the boom to a multitude of factors, including lockdowns giving people a greater desire for beautiful objects in their homes and growing income among people in the world of Indian tech and pharmaceuticals, with newly minted businessmen and entrepreneurs wanting to invest in art as something 'aspirational'. 'We are seeing a whole new type of collector, young people in their 30s and 40s, entering the Indian market with a completely new mindset,' said Vazirani. 'Art now has a societal standing and there's almost a social pressure to buy art and buy the best. So people who were entering the market at $100,000 are now willing to go up to half a million. At every auction we have seen records broken, one after the other.' Yet the shifts within the market are not solely within the sphere of Indian modern and contemporary art. For the first time, this year's art fair is showcasing rare items of Indian folk art, some dating back 100 years, illustrating changing perceptions towards older indigenous art within the Indian market, which has always been focused on the modern and contemporary. Among the works on show are a series of bronze mukhalingam sculptures, a representation of the Hindu god Shiva, which have never been seen in public before. 'Our folk culture has been much more popular overseas in the last four decades than it has on the Indian domestic market,' said Amit Jain, who curated the folk art booths at this year's fair. 'I'm used to this art and these artists being seen as on the peripheries so it's amazing to see India's full history brought into this contemporary space. It's high time that museums in India look at art laterally and not compartmentalised into modern and folk.' The fair will also address the darker side of the Indian art market, particularly when it comes to antiquities. Collectors and viewers have been invited to a tour of a Museum of Confiscated Antiquities in Purana Quila, an old fort in Delhi, where the objects on show will be those recently returned to India after being stolen and sold to wealthy collectors or displayed in the world's famed galleries. The museum features items reclaimed from high-profile looters now in jail but also institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 'India is one of the biggest victims of illicit trafficking of antiquities, it's a black market that's as big as drugs and ammunitions and we still have a lot of looting going on,' said Anica Mann, the curator of the young collectors programme at the fair who has curated and will lead the tour. 'Antiquities are a very important cog in the entire roster of south Asian art so it's about time we talked about ethical collecting.'", "a4b65e4dc4b36e8592c1e542be0f1aa963a266cc74cd7b0f8464f744": "Four years after Republicans embraced Donald Trump's nativist and often racist playbook in an attempt to keep control of Congress, the party is once again placing the volatile politics of immigration at the center of its midterm election strategy. From the US-Mexico border to the US Capitol, in hearing rooms and courtrooms, Republicans are hammering the issue. At the forefront of the debate is a once-obscure public health order invoked by the Trump administration in March 2020 ostensibly as a means for controlling the spread of the coronavirus along the south-western border. Seizing on a decision by the Biden administration to lift such 'Title 42' border restrictions, Republicans have sought to paint Democrats as pursuing an extremist immigration agenda that they say has cost the nation its very sovereignty. The provocative and often misleading messaging campaign was on full display when Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of homeland security, testified on Capitol Hill. For more than eight hours, across two days, Republicans pelted Mayorkas with accusations and insults, demanding he accept the blame for what they described as dangerous and dire conditions along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico. 'We're all really border states now,' Congressman Steve Chabot of Ohio said darkly. In another tense exchange, Ken Buck of Colorado said his constituents believed Mayorkas was guilty of treason and deserved to be impeached - something conservatives have vowed to pursue if they win the House. 'What you have just said - it is so profoundly offensive on so many different levels, in so many different regards,' Mayorkas responded, visibly upset.  Mayorkas forcefully defended the administration's handling of the border and said it was up to Congress to act. 'We inherited a broken and dismantled system that is already under strain,' Mayorkas said. 'It is not built to manage the current levels and types of migratory flows. Only Congress can fix this.' The hearings laid bare the tensions within Democratic ranks over Biden's immigration actions, particularly over Title 42. For months, immigration advocates and progressives have been pressuring Biden to lift Title 42, which gives officials the authority to swiftly expel migrants trying to enter the US instead of allowing them to seek asylum and remain in the country while their claim is evaluated. 'You're essentially doing policymaking by crisis,' said Claudia Flores, an immigration policy expert at the left-leaning Center for American Progress thinktank. 'And that's just not effective.' As a matter of public policy, Flores said, it was dangerous to use a public health order to control immigration. Not only was the rule insufficient for addressing problems at the border, she added, but it had carried 'grave humanitarian consequences' for asylum seekers. But some vulnerable Democrats have appealed to Biden to hold off on lifting the order, fearing it could be a political liability ahead of a difficult election cycle. Agreeing with Republicans, they have expressed concern that the administration lacks a comprehensive plan for dealing with the anticipated increase in migrants making asylum claims when the order is lifted in late May. 'This is not good for Democrats in November,' the Texas congressman Henry Cuellar, a Democrat facing a progressive challenge for his border-district seat, told Fox News Digital. 'You know, in talking with some of my Republican colleagues, they're saying, 'We can't believe the White House is giving us this narrative. We can't believe that they're hurting Democrat candidates for the November election.'' In his testimony, Mayorkas argued that his department had a plan to handle the expected surge of migrants. He repeatedly directed lawmakers to a six-point plan, released in advance of the hearings, that outlined a more aggressive effort to enforce immigration laws after the public health rule is lifted. It also included efforts to partner with non-profits that help migrants in the US while their cases are processed and to work with countries across the region to address 'root causes' of migration. 'When the Title 42 public health order is lifted, we anticipate migration levels will increase, as smugglers will seek to take advantage of and profit from vulnerable migrants,' the memo stated. It did little to appease Republicans and some Democrats. 'It's clear to me that the federal government is not prepared - not even close,' Greg Stanton of Arizona, a border-state Democrat, said during the hearing. Biden has worked to reverse many hardline policies that were at the heart of Trump's 'zero tolerance' approach to immigration. The number of migrants attempting to cross the border has risen sharply. Biden has argued that the only way to address the migration is at the source - an ambitious plan that will probably take years to bear fruit. In the short term, his administration faces acute operational and political challenges. At a White House meeting last week, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus urged the president to stand firm behind the decision to end the public health order. 'Title 42 must end on 23 May,' the California congresswoman Nanette Barragan, a deputy chair of the CHC, said she told the president, while urging him to 'not support legislation to extend the end-date'. With the prospects of legislative action dim ahead of the midterms, the caucus is urging Biden to use his executive authority to make good on some of his promises to Latino voters on immigration, the environment, healthcare and the economy. They have argued that it is both good policy and good politics, as Latino support for Democrats is waning amid concern over the economy and inflation. 'After four years of traumatic, xenophobic and inhumane immigration policies being forced on our most vulnerable communities, we have a duty to deliver them the protection and support they and their families so desperately need,' the Democratic congressman Adriano Espaillat, of New York, said after the meeting. Fears over Title 42 are only one element of the Republicans' messaging. Republicans have sought to tie illegal immigration to other potent themes like voter fraud and crime. Allegations of undocumented migrants voting in large numbers have been repeatedly disproved. Studies have found that migrants commit crime at lower rates than native-born citizens. Republicans have long used immigration as a political weapon - with mixed results. In 2018, they lost the House in a wave election fueled in part by fury over Trump's hardline policies that separated migrant children from their parents. The same year they expanded control in the Senate. The political winds have reversed. Republicans are heavily favored to take the House, and possibly the Senate. The national mood has soured on Biden and the Democrats as concerns over the economy and inflation deepen. But even as economic discontent dominates political debate, polling suggests immigration remains a pressing issue, particularly for Republicans. Four in 10 Americans, and nearly 70% of Republicans, say they worry a 'great deal' about illegal immigration, according to a Gallup survey. During a tour of the border in Texas last week, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, chided a reporter for asking about his false claim that he never urged Trump to resign after the January 6 insurrection - comments captured by an audio recording. 'After all this, that's what you want to ask?' he said. 'I don't think that's what the American people are asking. I think they want to know about what's going to happen here and how we're going to secure the border.' Democrats blame Republicans for whipping up fear while standing in the way of reform. It has been almost a decade since Congress seriously considered immigration reform, a bipartisan plan that was derailed by House conservatives. 'Let me tell you why our Republican colleagues don't want to do their job - why they won't work with us or vote for any of the bills that we have brought forward in the House,' the Texas congresswoman Veronica Escobar said. 'It's because the status quo works for them.' 'They love Title 42,' she said, arguing that it 'helps them push this xenophobic rage machine that they believe will help them get elected and re-elected'. It is unclear how the administration plans to proceed if a court rules it cannot lift Title 42. Biden declined to say whether he would sign legislation delaying the removal, which is under consideration by a bipartisan group in Congress. Vanessa Cardenas, deputy director of America's Voice, a pro-immigration group, said Democrats must be more aggressive in defending their vision for reform. Keeping Title 42, she said, would not only play into Republicans' hands, but would be a major disappointment to voters, particularly Latino voters who helped Democrats win in 2018 and 2020. 'In an election season where margins matter, in states like Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, where the presence and the vote of the Latino community can make a difference, it's really important that Democrats are able to articulate a vision that is in contrast to the other side,' Cardenas said. Referring to Trump's hardline adviser, she added: 'A Stephen Miller-Lite approach to immigration is not going to motivate the base.'", "d6513bf0ced70f56327707b610b35a87741cf9e6e6ee43183c437d52": "Hot, dry winds will continue to spur flames burning through the drought-stricken landscapes in the south-west and the American plains, complicating efforts to extinguish roughly a dozen destructive wildfires that have already driven thousands from their homes. Risks are usually higher in the region during this time of year and fire conditions typically ramp up in the months sandwiched between winter and summer rain seasons. But experts say the explosive start is an indication of what's to come in the warming months. Spiking temperatures threaten to bake more moisture out of the thirsty environments, setting the stage for ignitions to turn into infernos. 'Climate change is taking a situation that would be bad for us normally,' says Gregg Garffin, a climatologist at the University of Arizona, 'and turning the dial up.' Once confined to specific times of year, wildfire conditions are stretching across more months, and will likely continue until the region gets additional rain. More than a million acres have already burned across the country since the start of this year, an amount more than double last year for this date, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). The agency's accounting also shows that more fires have ignited this year than any other in the last decade and burn totals are more than 71% higher than the ten-year average. Last year's exceptionally strong summer monsoon in the south-west - which delivered record rainfall in some areas - led to a lush landscape that has now begun to brown. With temperatures rising, the parched plants have turned to fuel for flames, driven faster by gusty winds. The conditions aren't expected to abate anytime soon. Roughly 90% of the American west remains mired in drought with many areas desperately missing the winter rains they rely on to refill water-starved systems. 'You have this desiccation going on due to climate change and you combine that with other factors,' Garffin said, noting the La Nina pattern that delivered less winter rains across areas of the west, 'and it is really a year-round fire season.' La Nina is a climate system that develops in the Pacific ocean and delivers more dry days across the southern third of the US. Its drought-producing effects are especially pronounced in the south-west. The conditions have been particularly problematic in New Mexico, where five large fires have already burned more than 157,603 acres. The Southwest Coordination Center, the region's hub for a national coordination system that organizes information and mobilizes resources between federal and state dispatch centers, has bumped its preparedness level to four - the second highest category - noting the rising strain on local resources. 'That is like the bat signal saying, 'hey we need help over here,'' says Candice Stevenson a public information officer at the NIFC, noting that the area may need more national resources in the south-west. The National level is currently at 2 and there are more teams available to deploy. With months left before its fire season typically peaks in June, more acres have already burned in New Mexico than in seven of the last eight years. 'We have been busier than we have in the past with fire activity,' says Scott Overpeck, warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service based in Albuquerque, comparing the start of the season to other bad drought years in 2011 and 2018. 'We have been seeing the writing on the wall, in the sense that we know with the drought conditions that it is going to be a rough season.' April is also the state's windiest month which has spurred the spread. With no rain in the forecast, the state is bracing for strong gusts expected through next week. 'It is going to depend on when these storm systems come across and increase the winds that are really going to make trouble for us,' Overpeck says. Despite the harrowing conditions, firefighters made progress on the state's largest blaze, the The Calf canyon and Hermits peak fire. The fire, which had already consumed more than 63,720 acres on Friday, was 37% contained. A red flag warning remained in effect, with wind gusts of up to 50 mph, poor relative humidity, and rising temperatures threatening to test containment lines into the weekend. Roughly 960 firefighters and other personnel battling the blaze are prioritizing the safety of structures, but hundreds of homes have already been lost and nearly 300 buildings total have been damaged or destroyed, according to New Mexico fire officials. Conditions are not likely to improve in the coming days or weeks. 'We have a very large area from north-east New Mexico up into Colorado and western Kansas and we have designated it an extremely critical fire weather risk area,' says Bill Bunting, the chief of forecast operations at the Noaa/NWS Storm Prediction Center, noting that the dangerous combination of strong winds, low relative humidity, and dryness fuels 'the rapid spread and erratic behavior of any fire that gets started'. Bunting added that this will make it 'exceedingly difficult' to fight the fires already burning. There have already been a number of high-end fire weather danger days this year, according to Bunting and the threats are expected to persist. The NIFC has predicted an above-normal fire potential lasting through the spring in areas from the high plains through the south-west. The threats will also linger farther west, into central Oregon and northern California this spring, and will only grow there through the summer and autumn. With the snowpack waning, the agency also noted that historic water sources used for suppression might not be available. 'There will be wetting rains in some areas but overall, it does suggest that it is going to be an active fire season,' Bunting says. 'It is just a reminder - you can have dangerous fire conditions any time of the year.'", "55711915ecc152475c3c0d87983bee8af818b4f5b8a8644393c99b91": "When you think about Tennessee, you're more likely to be thinking country music, barbecue and bourbon than crypto, blockchain and Web3. The state legislature has plans to change that. Tennessee just passed a bill that could help it become a leader in states providing a home to entrepreneurs who want to set up a unique kind of company that uses the blockchain to automate its decision-making. It's called a DAO. More of that in a moment. First, a few definitions. The 'blockchain' is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network and stores its information in a digital format and in such a way that changes can be made only once approvals from multiple parties are made in 'the chain'. The blockchain is the foundation for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, which use the unique identifiers of the blockchain to create their value. It's all part of the new, distributed iteration of the internet, called web 3.0 or Web3. DAOs are another thing that's grown from all of this: A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is formed on the blockchain by multiple parties and, like other blockchain transactions, requires all decisions to be authorized by those members before actions can be taken. One example of a DAO is BeetsDAO, a company that aims to support projects in music, gaming and art. The organization pooled its members' funds but, because it's a DAO, no purchases can be made unless all the members democratically approve its transactions. A DAO has no leader. All of its moves are collective - and usually automated - driven by 'smart' contracts that follow previously agreed-upon rules and are powered on the blockchain. Rules cannot be edited without people noticing - it's transparent and public. 'The dream,' BeetsDAO founder Jordan Garbis said during a panel discussion last year, is to 'create networks of communities that actually drive the value of artists.' Garbis' company made a name for itself by plunking down $250,000 for a digital piece created by Snoop Dogg and Nyan Cat. Many other companies in the Web3 world have formed themselves as DAOs because they feel it's a better and more equitable way to do business. Now you may ask: what does all this have to do with Tennessee? As mentioned above, earlier this month the Tennessee state legislature unanimously passed a new bill that formally recognizes the registration of DAOs. Believe it or not, the only state to do this so far is Wyoming. Why do these states, which aren't usually considered hot tech spots, care about this? It's simple: jobs. 'With this new business structure, Tennessee will a beacon for blockchain investment and new jobs,' state representative Jason Powell told the Nashville Scene. 'Just as Delaware became a hub for traditional LLCs or South Dakota for credit card companies.' So will crypto entrepreneurs be flocking to Tennessee to start up their DAOs? Powell - and many other of the state's legislators - certainly hope so. And they have cause for optimism. 'Nashville is quickly becoming a hotbed for Web3 companies,' Mike Audi, a tech company founder and one of the first to become a legal DAO in the state told Decrypt, a news site that follows Web3 developments. 'With supportive legislation expect to see more of it. Founders will flock here, build here and stay here.' DAOs represent a new type of corporate structure based on a new type of business model. The blockchain is creating countless entrepreneurs making money from digital products and digital currencies. Some governments have been slow to recognize the significance of this growing trend. But others - even from unlikely places like Tennessee - get it. And they're adapting their laws to make it easy for tomorrow's crypto entrepreneurs to succeed. That kind of forward thinking can only benefit the taxpayers they represent in the years to come.

The dismantlement of debris in Kyiv, where Russian missiles hit on Thursday continues, he said in his latest national address late on Friday. Zelenskiy continued to provide an operational update as to Russia's advances, describing the city of Mariupol as a 'Russian concentration camp in the middle of ruins'. Describing the situation in the temporarily occupied areas of the Kherson region, Zelenskiy said Russian forces are allegedly preparing for the transition to the 'ruble zone'.  'Any attempt to transfer our territory to Russia's administrative, monetary, or any other system will mean only one thing: Russia itself will suffer from that,' he said. 'Our responses, sanctions and other reactions of the free world to Russia's aggressive actions will not be delayed.'  Thank you for following our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This blog has now closed. You can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war in our new live blog in the link below. A series of murals across Europe offer a creative protest against the war in Ukraine. Lifting sanctions imposed on Russia is part of peace negotiations between Moscow and Ukraine, which are 'not going well' but continue via videoconferencing on a daily basis, Lavrov said. Kyiv warned on Friday that talks on ending Russia's invasion, now in its third month, were in danger of collapse. In comments to China's Xinhua news agency, Lavrov said: 'We are in favour of continuing the negotiations, although they are not going well,' Lavrov added.  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has insisted that western sanctions on Russia needed to be strengthened and could not be part of negotiations. If you have just joined us, here is comprehensive re-cap of where things stand: Russia' foreign minister also thanked Beijing for their 'balanced position' on Ukraine. Russia's foreign minister doubled down on his assertions against the west, claiming 'the sooner' the west comes to terms with 'new geopolitical realities' the better it will be for itself and the international community. Lavrov continued to argue that those 'who pursue an independent course in domestic and foreign policy' are suppressed by the west 'by the most brutal methods'.  More than 1 million people have been 'evacuated from Ukraine' into Russia since 24 February, Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov claimed in remarks published by the ministry early on Saturday. Lavrov claimed the hotline of Russia's interdepartmental coordination headquarters for humanitarian response received requests for assistance in evacuating 2.8 million people to Russia, of which 16,000 were foreign citizens and employees of UN and OSCE international missions.  'In total, 1.02 million people were evacuated from Ukraine, the DPR and the LPR, of which over 120 thousand citizens of third countries,' the foreign minister said in comments made to China's Xinhua news agency. Ukraine has said that Moscow has forcefully deported thousands of people to Russia with humanitarian corridors repeatedly breaking down. According to data from the United Nations, more than 5.4 million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the invasion. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has had some stern words to say about the west's involvement in Ukraine in a rare interview with China's official Xinhua news agency. The transcript from the interview was published on the Russian foreign ministry's website early Saturday morning.  Among a string of assertions, the foreign minister accused the United States and Nato countries of using Ukraine as 'one of the tools to contain Russia' while maintaining that prior to Russia's invasion on 24 February they were 'forcing Kyiv to make an artificial, false choice: either with the West or with Moscow.' It was these conditions that gave Russia 'no other choice' but to recognise the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics and launch a 'special military operation' to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine, Lavrov continued. In fact, Nato countries are 'doing everything to prevent' a negotiated cease fire with Ukraine, Lavrov maintained.  If the US and Nato are really interested in resolving the Ukrainian crisis, then, firstly, they should change their minds and stop supplying arms and ammunition to Kyiv, Lavrov said, adding that Russia is 'in favour' of continuing the negotiations, although 'they are not going well'. Lavrov said it would only be possible to reach agreements when Kyiv begins to be guided by the interests of the Ukrainian people, and not 'advisers from afar'. The 'special military operation' launched on 24 February is 'developing strictly according to plan' and all its goals 'will be surely achieved, despite the opposition of our opponents,' the foreign minister concluded.  The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) will support Ukrainian athletes seeking to resettle in Australia on humanitarian grounds amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, outgoing AOC President John Coates said on Saturday. Coates told the AOC's annual general meeting in Sydney that it was 'sad' young Ukrainian athletes were swapping sports equipment to take up arms against Russia's forces, Reuters reports the president as saying.  'Today I announced that the AOC executive has by circular resolution last week, determined that the AOC will support humanitarian visa applications by Ukrainian athletes and will seek the assistance of you, our member sports, in their settlement requirements,' said Coates, who is also a vice president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Coates added that the AOC would contribute $100,000 to the IOC's 'Solidarity Fund' for the Ukrainian Olympic community. 'They have lost their right to membership of the international Olympic community. There are no stadiums for their colours, no poles for their flags, no music for their songs and no dais for their athletes,' Coates added. Russia's 'special military operation' in Ukraine will be finished as soon as its objectives are achieved, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has said in an interview with Al Arabiya television channel, as cited by RIA Novosti. 'It will be completed as soon as the goals, which I have already described, are accomplished and achieved,' he said. In Lavrov's view, any weapons shipment to Ukraine is a legitimate target, RIA reported. The minister emphasised that the special operation was a response to what Nato was doing in Ukraine to prepare it for an aggressive stand against Russia.  'It has become evident that the goals of the military operation, which I have described, must be accomplished. I can assure you that during this military operation the Kiev regime's escapades have been taken care of,' the foreign minister added. Shipments of new US military aid are en route to Ukraine after President Joe Biden asked Congress on Thursday for $33bn to bolster Ukraine's fight against Russia. In the images below, airmen and women with the 436th Aerial Port Squadron place 155mm shells, fused and helmets on aircraft pallets ultimately bound for Ukraine on a C-17 cargo aircraft on Friday at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said there is a big risk that peace talks with Moscow would end and blamed public anger over what he said were atrocities by Russian troops. 'People [Ukrainians] want to kill them. When that kind of attitude exists, it's hard to talk about things,' Interfax news agency quoted the president as telling Polish journalists.", "643106f314b738a23efe6118975ae8156e5068b398eb33f37d6ff273": "The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has described how Russian forces came close to capturing or assassinating him in the early hours of the invasion. Zelenskiy has been widely lauded for his response to the invasion in the 65 days since the first Russian troops entered Ukraine. He has addressed the US Congress, the World Bank and the Grammy Awards; Boris Johnson is among the high-profile figures eager to be seen in his company. But his time as the leader of a country under attack from a far more powerful neighbour could have ended within hours of the invasion beginning, according to interviews in Time magazine. Speaking to reporter Simon Shuster, who spent a fortnight in the presidential compound in Kyiv, Zelenskiy described how Russian troops came close to finding him and his family as they attempted to seize the capital's government district on day one of the conflict. While many of his memories of those first few hours remained 'fragmented', Zelenskiy said the predawn of 24 February stood out. After the bombing had started, he and his wife, Olena Zelenska, went to tell their daughter, 17, and son, nine, to prepare to flee their home. 'We woke them up,' Zelenskiy told Time. 'It was loud. There were explosions over there.' The Ukrainian military told Zelenskiy that Russian strike teams had parachuted into Kyiv to kill or capture him and his family. 'Before that night, we had only ever seen such things in the movies,' Andriy Yermak, his chief of staff, told the magazine. Gunfights broke out around the government quarter as night fell on the first day of the war, Shuster wrote. 'Guards inside the compound shut the lights and brought bulletproof vests and assault rifles for Zelenskiy and about a dozen of his aides.' One of the few officials who knew how to use the weapons was Oleksiy Arestovych, a veteran of Ukraine's military intelligence service. 'It was an absolute madhouse,' Arestovych told Time. 'Automatics for everyone.' Russian troops made two attempts to storm the compound while Zelenskiy's family were still inside, according to Shuster. The following night, after refusing offers of more secure surroundings - including an evacuation by US and British forces that would enable him to set up a government in exile - Zelenskiy walked outside into the courtyard to record a now-famous video message on his phone. At that moment Zelenskiy said he became truly aware of his role in the war. 'You understand that they're watching,' he told the magazine. 'You're a symbol. You need to act the way the head of state must act.'", "11969a3b704963dc48b1f9d87d6ba4b39320a4b4a5d5696828e00535": "Russia hit Kyiv with cruise missile strikes in a menacing display of defiance while the UN secretary general was visiting the city and a few hours after Joe Biden had announced a doubling of US military and economic aid to Ukraine. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the strikes happened 'immediately after' his talks with the UN chief, Antonio Guterres, 'and this says a lot about Russia's true attitude to global institutions, about the efforts of the Russian leadership to humiliate the UN and everything that the organisation represents. 'Therefore, it requires a strong response,' Zelenskiy added. Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called the strikes a 'heinous act of barbarism' that demonstrated Russia's attitude towards Ukraine, Europe and the world. At least 10 people were injured when one of the two missiles launched struck the lower floors of a 25-storey residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district of the capital, Ukrainian state emergency officials said. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said three people were in hospital. 'We are still in shock. We were in the house when they bombed the building,' Maksym Maksymov, 29, a sales manager, told the Guardian. 'We heard the first strike. And the then a second missile hit the building.' Guterres said he was shocked by the missile strikes, 'not because I'm here but because Kyiv is a sacred city for Ukrainians and Russians alike'. In his nightly address, Zelenskiy said the missile strikes on Kyiv and other cities 'prove that we cannot let our guard down'. He thanked the US for the proposed new funding saying that prompt weapons supplies were 'salvation not only for our people - this is salvation for all of you - for all of Europe'. In other developments: Thursday's missile strikes came hours after Biden asked Congress to give immediate approval for spending that would include over $33bn in military aid, involving everything from heavy artillery and armoured vehicles to greater intelligence sharing, cyberwarfare tools and many more anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. Biden also requested $8.5bn in economic aid to Kyiv and $3bn in humanitarian relief, as well as funds to help increase US production of food crops and strategic minerals to offset the impact of the war in Ukraine on global supplies. The total of $33bn is more than twice the last supplemental request approved by Congress in March and dwarfs the entire defense budget of Ukraine and of many other countries. The US president said it was aimed at helping Ukraine repel the renewed Russian offensives in the east and south of the country, but also to transition to assuring the nation's longer-term security needs. On the same day, Congress agreed to update the 1941 lend-lease legislation with which Franklin D Roosevelt sought to help Britain and other allies fight Nazi Germany. The updated law is intended to make it easier for the US to provide military equipment to Ukraine. It comes in the face of Russian warnings that increased western weapons supplies to Ukraine would endanger European security, that western intervention could bring instant Russian reprisals and raise the risk of nuclear conflict. Making the case for western aid, Biden argued that on the contrary, if Putin was not stopped in Ukraine he would continue to threaten global peace and stability. The president framed the request principally in terms of defending Ukraine, and did not explicitly repeat the declaration earlier this week by his defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, that one of US aims in Ukraine was to weaken Russia to stop it attacking other countries. 'Despite the disturbing rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin, the facts are plain for everybody to see. We're not attacking Russia. We're helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression,' Biden said. But he added the cost involved was 'a small price to pay to punish Russia and aggression, to lessen the risk of future conflicts'. 'Throughout our history, we've learned that when dictators do not pay the price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and engage in more aggression,' he said. 'The threats to America and the world keep rising. We can't let this happen.' The new military assistance the congressional funding will finance will include: The Kremlin's official spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, warned on Thursday that an increased western supply of heavy weapons to Kyiv would endanger European security. 'The tendency to pump weapons, including heavy weapons, into Ukraine, these are the actions that threaten the security of the continent, provoke instability,' Peskov said. The day before, Vladimir Putin had threatened a 'lightning fast' response to western intervention in Ukraine, adding: 'We have all the weapons we need for this.'  His foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has accused the US and its allies of fighting a proxy war in Ukraine and warned of the rising danger of a nuclear conflict. Biden rejected the accusation he was fighting a proxy war, describing the claim as part of the Kremlin's domestic propaganda to explain the inability of Russian forces to achieve their goals. 'I think it's more of a reflection, not of the truth, but of their failure,' the president said. He added: 'No one should be making idle comments about the use of nuclear weapons.' The package of proposals the administration is sending to Congress also includes measures to strengthen the hand of the justice department in pursuing Kremlin-aligned oligarchs seizing their assets and using the proceeds to support the war effort in Ukraine. Biden made his announcement as the UN secretary general was visiting Ukraine, where he described the war as 'an absurdity' in the 21st century. Guterres was touring Borodianka on Thursday, where Russian forces are accused of massacring civilians before their withdrawal, on his first visit to Ukraine since the start of the invasion on 24 February, before talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In nearby Bucha, where dozens of civilian bodies, some with their hands tied, were discovered this month, Guterres backed an investigation by the international criminal court into possible war crimes in Ukraine. 'I appeal to the Russian Federation to accept, to cooperate with the ICC,' he said. Ukraine's prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova named 10 Russian soldiers allegedly involved in human rights abuses during the month-long occupation of Bucha. Venediktova also told German TV that that Ukrainian investigators had identified 'more than 8,000 cases' of suspected war crimes since Russia's invasion.", "a7c2ec71b55e4ae07fb2f9d7a4e81176c5ad94f6ddb7b6dec6418949": "Ukraine's prosecutor general has named 10 Russian soldiers allegedly involved in human rights abuses during the month-long occupation of Bucha. Iryna Venediktova also told German TV that that Ukranian investigators had identified 'more than 8,000 cases' of suspected war crimes since Russia's invasion, which included accusations of 'killing civilians, bombing of civilian infrastructure, torture' and 'sexual crimes'. Her comments came as the international criminal court (ICC) ramps up its investigation into alleged war crimes committed in Ukraine since the start of the war. The Dutch government will 'very soon' send a team of 'several dozen' forensic specialists to Ukraine on behalf of the ICC to gather evidence of human rights abuses, the ANP press agency reported on Thursday. Russian forces' retreat from Kyiv in early April left horrifying evidence of atrocities littered across the region's suburbs and towns, where scores of bodies in civilian clothes were found lying in the streets or buried in shallow graves. In a Facebook post on Thursday, Venediktova identified 10 soldiers - two sergeants, four corporals and four privates - who she said were all 'involved in the torture of peaceful people' during the brutal occupation of Bucha, a small commuter town 18.5 miles north-west of Kyiv. Venediktova said the soldiers were part of the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade, a unit based in the Khabarovsk region, on the Pacific coast in Russia's far east. 'During the occupation of Bucha, they took unarmed civilians hostage, killed them with hunger and thirst, and kept them on their knees with their hands tied and their eyes taped. [The hostages] were mocked and beaten with fists and the rifle stocks. They were beaten for information about the location of the [Ukrainian] armed forces ... and some were tortured for no reason at all,' she wrote. Venediktova appealed to the public to help gather evidence, and said that Ukrainian prosecutors and police officers are now investigating whether any of the men were also involved in homicides. Ukraine, together with a number of western countries and human rights organisations, has accused Russian forces of summarily killing civilians in Bucha. Stanislav Kozynchuk, the deputy head of the prosecutor's office for the Kyiv region, said that investigators are working with victims to identify the perpetrators of human rights abuses. 'Our suspects are military personnel from the Russian Federation,' he said. 'We understand who was there, what happened, and now we are looking into these military units which participated in the killings.' Some of the implicated soldiers have already been redeployed to fight in eastern Ukraine, he said. In a recent report, Human Rights Watch said that 'Russian forces committed a litany of apparent war crimes during their occupation' of the town, adding that   investigators 'found extensive evidence of summary executions, other unlawful killings, enforced disappearances and torture, all of which would constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity.' The Guardian has reported that dozens of civilians who died during the Russian occupation of Bucha were killed by tiny metal arrows from shells of a type fired by Russian artillery. Earlier this month, Ukraine's defence ministry identified Russia's 64th Motor Rifle Brigade as the unit that had occupied Bucha, publishing the names, ranks and passport details of all the soldiers. Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement in the alleged human rights abuses, while Russian state television has aired reports claiming that the images of dead civilians in Bucha were staged or the result of crimes committed by Ukrainian forces. During a meeting with the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, in the Kremlin on Tuesday, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said that 'Russian forces had no connections to Bucha.' 'We know who did it. We know who prepared this provocation ... We know who they are,' Putin added, without providing further details. Earlier this month, Putin awarded the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade the honorary title of 'guards' and praised the unit for its 'great heroism and courage'. 'This high distinction recognises your special merits, great heroism and courage in defending your Fatherland, and in protecting Russia's sovereignty and national interests,' Putin's statement said.", "1968db458872620a78e53ed432ef7c12a89e829280954dec8fab0512": "The government has acknowledged that processing problems within the Home Office have led to delays between the approval of visas for Ukrainian refugees and emailed notification that the visas have been granted - preventing many vulnerable people from swiftly making their way to safety. Politicians from all parties highlighted a variety of serious problems with the Homes for Ukraine visa scheme during an urgent question in the Commons on the Home Office's handling of the refugee crisis. Latest figures show that just one in five of those issued visas under the Homes for Ukraine scheme had arrived in the UK. MPs suggested that the relatively small number of people travelling was the consequence of visas not being issued to family units simultaneously, with approval of children's visas often taking several weeks longer. About 86,000 visas have been issued to people fleeing Ukraine under the government's two Ukraine refugee schemes (the Ukraine family scheme and the Homes for Ukraine scheme) but just 27,100 have travelled to the UK. Of the51,300 visas issued under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, only 11,000 have actually arrived in the UK. The Home Office minister Kevin Foster dismissed as nonsense reports that there was a deliberate Home Office policy to withhold children's visas. 'I am aware of the claims that have been made, the false claims I have to say, that there is a deliberate move to withhold individual visas. Those are absolute nonsense,' he told the Commons. But he admitted there were bureaucratic issues which meant refugees were not immediately receiving emails informing them that the visas had been granted. 'We have been aware of an issue with the way the current system is working, in terms of the decision being made and then needing to be dispatched,' he said. It has been clear for a number of weeks that there are serious delays between visas being approved and refugees receiving emails telling them they have permission to travel. This is understood to be the result of a workflow backlog between two separate teams of civil servants, with one group responsible for visa decisions and another group, based elsewhere, in charge of communicating those decisions. Foster said there was a separate team working on 'ensuring dispatch', but said the government was working on creating 'a fully online', automated system next month, which would 'resolve that particular issue'. The shadow Home Office minister Stephen Kinnock said there was widespread frustration at the speed with which refugee casework was being processed, adding: 'For too many, the hotline has gone stone cold.' Numerous MPs said delays in issuing visas were causing refugees to run out of money, exposing them to homelessness and a variety of other dangers while they waited for the UK government to grant their visas. Stuart McDonald, the Scottish National party's Home Office spokesperson, said the government had erected 'a massive wall of bureaucracy and red tape' which was 'causing totally avoidable misery for Ukrainians fleeing war', and called for the visa regime to be scrapped. Fellow SNP MP Deirdre Brock highlighted the case of Yulia, a primary school teacher from Kharkiv who has been waiting more than a month for her two-year-old daughter's visa to be granted. She was told earlier this week that the visa had been granted, and travel documents would be issued in a couple of days. 'But the child's mother had been phoned by mistake as it was, in fact, someone else's visa that had been granted, and it would take around another two weeks for the right visa to come through. These folks are, in effect, homeless,' she said. 'Each day the message that they are welcome in the UK fades a little more.' Andrew Saunders, who has offered to sponsor Yulia and her daughter, Diana, said: 'From start to finish it has been a staggeringly incompetent and inappropriate process - it was meant to take three to five days but we are more than a month in and we still await the visa for the two-year-old.' Yulia, who asked for her surname not to be printed, said she was puzzled by the need to conduct protracted checks before issuing a visa to a two-year-old. After a month in Germany, she said, she was running out of money, and her daughter was increasingly unsettled. 'I am feeling really upset and frustrated. We have already stayed in four places and we have to move again this weekend so I'm looking for a fifth place to stay. I feel powerless.' A government spokesperson said: 'We are processing thousands of visas a day - this shows the changes we made to streamline the service are working and we'll continue to build on this success so we can speed up the process even further.'", "3c439722a079f15777c948890b593f42eac1bd53341b0bae1398125c": "Just as Britain has positioned itself as the most munificent provider of weaponry to Ukraine, so it has adopted the most uncompromising of approaches to the terms for a final peace settlement with Russia. Judging by the near existential tone of the foreign secretary Liz Truss's speech on Wednesday evening, the UK is self-consciously now on the provisional wing of the small group of allies that are privately discussing the terms of how the war might end. Not all of it is in the public domain, but in her speech Truss made clear that Russia would be required to leave the whole of Ukraine, and so no longer retain its foothold in the Donbas in the east and Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. In this view she gained the support of the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, on Thursday. She also agrees with the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, that Russia must end the war so weakened militarily that it cannot repeat its threats not only to Ukraine but to Moldova and the Baltic states. For good measure there would have to be reparations - a payment to Ukraine for the damage Moscow had inflicted - in an echo of the principles followed by allied forces against Germany in 1919: punishment, payment and prevention. These terms may not end up as humiliating as the notorious Versailles peace treaty of that year, but they would leave little room for doubt that Putin had lost. The UK has long said that not only must Putin fail in his war, he must also be seen to fail. Discussions on how to define failure in any peace settlement are at an early stage in the cell of diplomats from 'the Quad' - the US, UK, France and Germany - discussing the issue. The discussions will evolve as the battlefield evolves. But it is possible that some of what Truss is canvassing is no more than an attempt to counterbalance what the UK fears will be the German or French proclivity to slip back into old dialogue patterns with Moscow. It may also be that Truss sees little political downside in being the coldest of cold war warriors inside the cabinet. But it is not all political calculation. The British position also stems from a thoroughgoing analysis set out in the speech of what it sees as being at stake in Ukraine, and how this must lead to a new security order in which Russia is marginalised. Truss sees this as a moment when the age of authoritarians ends, and in this sense Ukraine is fighting not just for its homeland but for the security of the west. By the same token, the speech was peppered with warnings to China that access to western markets is conditional. She also sent a message to Berlin, telling them the Wandel durch Handel - the assumption that economic integration and trade can drive political change - had been proven false. In dismissing this tenet she not only rejected the Ostpolitik of Germany's Social Democrats, but also the assumptions of successive German chancellors. Trading with Russia did not lure Moscow towards democracy, she said. Instead, Putin 'took the money from oil and gas and used it to consolidate power and gain leverage abroad'. It is mildly ironic that the German politician with whom Truss allies herself most in saying this is the Green foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock - not her natural political soul sister. But wars create novel alliances. Truss argues that this new approach melds hard security and economic security. Just as China should never have been given access to UK infrastructure or its telecoms network, so Germany should not have handed its ability to keep the lights on to Gazprom. Critics of Truss will say her rhetoric, including the promise to keep arming Ukraine, serves only to inflame Moscow and risks dangerous escalation. The UK's endorsement of Ukraine using its weapons to hit targets inside Russia, for instance, makes it more likely that Moscow will regard Nato forces outside Ukraine or Nato trainers inside Ukraine as proxies and legitimate targets. It encourages Putin's growing tendency to present his 'special military operation' not as a limited liberation of the Donbas, but as a systemic struggle with Nato in which Ukraine merely becomes the first military battlefield. Truss seemed prepared to answer that critique on Wednesday when she described the British as 'risk takers' with a history of standing up to bullies. Her allies point out that Putin has previously threatened but not carried through on a nuclear response to the crossing of Russia's red lines. She also seems optimistic that China ultimately will draw back from supporting Putin since it will not want to be on the losing side. India, too, if given modern western arms rather than old Soviet weapons, could end its hedging. With heavier weapons being delivered at a faster rate, Truss no longer thinks the war will last as long as five years - a view she held privately some months back. Yet that optimism does not reduce the risk in her calculus. In her speech Truss portrayed Putin as unpredictable and therefore qualitatively different from Soviet leaders for whom international reputation mattered, and with whom at least the Cuban missile crisis could be averted. But if Putin is the rogue Truss describes, and feels the only peace terms on offer are humiliation, he has little motive to sue for peace. If cornered, he may make good his threat to escalate by using nuclear weapons or lightning strikes on his true adversary, Nato. The more the stakes are raised, the more there is to lose. As the French prime minister Georges Clemenceau remarked in the context of 1918, sometimes 'it is easier to make war than peace'.", "8e30dadfec0c7b9d18cb923293f7a7b013932d6d283522d3d05a082d": "Moldova is facing 'a very dangerous new moment', the country's deputy prime minister has said, as he warned that unnamed forces were seeking to stoke tensions after a series of explosions in the breakaway region of Transnistria this week. In a briefing with journalists, Nicu Popescu said his government had seen 'a dangerous deterioration of the situation' in recent days, after grenade attacks on the 'ministry of security' in the breakaway region of Transnistria on Monday. The attacks with rocket-propelled grenades represented 'a very dangerous new moment in the history of our region,', he said, adding that Moldova's institutions had been put on high alert in response. Fears are growing that Moldova and Transnistria could be drawn into the Ukraine conflict. The predominantly Russian-speaking region of Transnistria in eastern Moldova has been controlled by pro-Russia separatists since 1992 after a short war when Moscow intervened on the side of the rebels. Last week a senior Russian commander said gaining control over southern Ukraine would help Russia link up with Transnistria, which shares a 453km border with Ukraine. Then on Monday came a series of mysterious explosions targeting Transnistria's 'state security ministry', a radio tower and military unit. 'Our analysis so far shows that there are tensions between different forces within the region interested in destabilising the situation and that makes the Transnistrian region vulnerable and creates risks for the Republic of Moldova,' said Popescu, who added that a majority of Moldovans, including those in Transnistria, wanted to stay out of the war. Moldova's government, which does not control Transnistria, was working through several hypotheses about the cause of the attacks, he said, adding that it could be a provocation or 'the result of some tensions of some forces inside this region'. He added: 'We cannot point exactly the finger or put the blame, but what we see is that indeed there are some forces inside the region that work towards the destabilisation of the situation inside this region.' According to Popescu, who is also Moldova's foreign minister, Transnistrian authorities announced last week they were stopping all men of fighting age from leaving the region, which he described as a sign that 'we are not yet out of the potential danger zone'. Moldova had received public and private assurances from Moscow 'that Russia continues to recognise the territorial integrity of Moldova', he said, adding that 'given the situation in the region, we remain very alert'. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed on Thursday that recent incidents in Transnistria were an attempt to drag it into the conflict in Ukraine. Transnistrian authorities have blamed Ukraine for the attacks, while Kyiv has pointed the finger at Russia, saying Moscow is seeking to destablise the region. One senior EU diplomat said the incidents were 'clearly prepared by Russia themselves', a view that was based on their analysis of the situation, rather than intelligence sources. 'We don't see that there will be an active conflict', the diplomat said, 'but you never know because they [Russia] have done crazy things'. One of Europe's poorest countries, Moldova is grappling with a large influx of refugees and the economic fallout of the war that has stopped nearly 15% of its exports. About 95,000 people fleeing the war in Ukraine have arrived in Moldova, equivalent to 3.5% of the population, according to the Moldovan foreign ministry. While the number has stabilised and even decreased recently, the former Soviet country is still adapting to the new arrivals, with Ukrainian refugees now accounting for one in 10 of the child population in Moldova. The war is also having 'major negative economic impacts', Popescu said as up to 14% of Moldova's exports, which had gone to Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, had 'virtually stopped'. Inflation had shot up to 22% and the price of Moldova's imports had gone up, as the nearby Ukrainian port of Odesa - the cheapest way to transport many goods - was no longer available. Moldova is seeking economic support from the EU, as well as eventual membership of the bloc. The government in Chisinau filed a membership application in March soon after Ukraine launched its bid to join the EU, and is busy answering hundreds of questions from Brussels about its readiness to join. Last week, Moldova's government announced it had submitted to Brussels an initial questionnaire answering 369 questions; it is now working through a second document covering 2,000 other queries on the country's compatibility with EU law. 'We are a country with a European history, a European identity, a European language - and our Romanian language is already an official language of the EU, so that makes things much easier,' Popescu said, adding that Moldova had proven it was adept at changing governments through democratic means. But even EU member states sympathetic to Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia's membership bids say these countries are unlikely to join anytime soon.", "bc47bb733694eb063932386883ca88e568268ee4f0d10cb6406cf200": "Energy companies in Germany and Hungary have confirmed they intend to comply with Vladimir Putin's demand that buyers of Russian gas pay in roubles. But the EU has said there is a risk the companies would be in breach of sanctions prohibiting transactions with Russia's central bank. The stakes are high because the Kremlin has already switched off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria. Putin said buyers from 'unfriendly' countries must start paying for their gas in roubles. Usually, the vast majority of buyers would pay in euros or dollars. Their bill from Russia's state energy group Gazprom would be deemed settled once the payment went through. Under decree 172, which Putin issued in March, buyers have to take part in a new payment system that requires the opening of two accounts at Gazprombank. Money would be paid into one account in euros and dollars before being converted by the bank into roubles and paid to Gazprom from the second account. Only at that point would the buyer be deemed to have fulfilled its legal obligation to pay for the gas. Hungary has said it is happy with the plan and, according to reports, three of Europe's biggest gas companies - Germany's Uniper, Italy's Eni and Austria's OMV - are also examining ways to comply with Putin's decree. Until this week it was unclear whether Putin would make good on his threat to cut off buyers who refuse his demand. But on Wednesday Gazprom suspended gas supplies to Bulgaria's Bulgargaz and Poland's PGNiG after they declined to pay in roubles. This is where it gets thorny. European leaders, including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, have said they will not do Putin's bidding. The EU's preliminary analysis, issued earlier this month, found that to do so would be a breach of sanctions imposed on the Kremlin. This is because the currency conversion process at the heart of it involves the Russian central bank, which is under sanctions. 'As the conversion process may take an undefined amount of time, during which time the foreign currency is entirely in the hands of the Russian authorities including the central bank, it may even be considered as a loan granted by EU companies,' the commission said. On Thursday, EU officials confirmed that any company agreeing to open a rouble account in Russia and pay for gas that way would be in breach of sanctions. Possibly. According to further guidance issued by the EU last week, the Kremlin's decree does not stop gas importers asking Gazprom to agree the purchase is legally complete once the first payment, in euros or dollars, has been deposited at Gazprombank. Any conversion into roubles would take place thereafter, meaning the buyer would not technically have breached sanctions. Another option, the guidance says, is for buyers to make a public declaration that they consider the purchase complete once their dollar or euro payment is made. The only obstacle to this, according to the guidance, is the need for 'confirmation from the Russian side' that all of this complies with decree 172. In other words, Gazprom - or effectively the Kremlin - has to be onboard. Gazprom and Gazprombank are not subject to EU sanctions, so buyers are permitted to negotiate such labyrinthine proposals without breaching sanctions. Tactics like these appear to be what the likes of OMV and Uniper are examining. Uniper said it was looking into 'concrete payment modalities' that would allow it to pay while complying with sanctions. This apparent legal loophole significantly clouds the picture over the true nature of compliance with Putin's demand. For instance, responding to reports that OMV was preparing to make rouble payments, the Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, insisted this was not the case. Putin's 'weaponisation' of Russian gas exports is part of a strategy designed to shore up the economy that was announced shortly after the war began. The decision by the west to impose sanctions prompted a sharp fall in the value of the rouble and increased the threat of hyperinflation. In response, Russia imposed strict capital controls under which exporting companies were forced to convert their foreign currency earnings into roubles. Liam Peach, an emerging market economist at Capital Economics, said the capital controls had made the rouble a one-way bet for currency traders, helping to explain why it had recovered to its pre-invasion levels against the dollar. Peach said this week's action against Poland and Bulgaria would not have a major economic impact on Russia. 'European importers will continue to pay Gazprombank in euros, which it will then convert into roubles. It doesn't make a big difference,' he said. 'Politically, Putin is trying to show Russia is standing up to sanctions and is able to apply a bit of pressure.' There are two possible explanations for this. The first is that payments in euros or dollars would add to Russia's foreign currency reserves, which have been frozen since the start of the war. Payment in roubles for Russia's gas supports the economy at a time when it is facing a deep recession. The second reason is that Russia has gradually been moving away from settlement in dollars and euros since it annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia has been seeking to increase payments in roubles and yuan for its energy, and the war in Ukraine has accelerated that trend.", "f1aa2713a8b7e7ca50675a7b55fe1239fd029d5e38d2158c74239b00": "The premier of the British Virgin Islands (BVI) has been arrested in a sting operation in Miami on charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and money laundering. The BVI governor, John Rankin, confirmed in a statement that Andrew Fahie had been arrested on Thursday morning, saying: 'I realise this will be shocking news for people in the territory. And I would call for calm at this time.' Oleanvine Maynard, the manager director of the Caribbean territory's port authority, and her son Kadeem were also detained in the operation. Court papers filed in Florida alleged Fahie, who was also referred to as 'head coach', was involved in conspiracy to import at least 5kg of cocaine and money laundering between 16 October last year and 28 April 2022. DEA agents allege in the documents that Oleanvine and Kadeem Maynard agreed with undercover agents - who were posing as members of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel - to set up a meeting between Lebanese Hezbollah operatives and Fahie in order to establish a place to store thousands of kilograms of drugs arriving from Colombia. The plan offered by the agents was to store the drug, bundled inside 5kg buckets of paint, in the BVI for one or two days before shipment to Miami or New York, the papers said. Fahie and Oleanvine Maynard were arrested at a Miami airport after being invited by undercover agents to see a shipment of $700,000 in cash that BVI officials expected to receive for their part in the alleged plot, the court papers alleged. Liz Truss, the British foreign secretary, said she was 'appalled' by the arrest. Truss said: 'This afternoon, the premier of the British Virgin Islands, Andrew Fahie, was arrested in the United States on charges related to drugs trafficking and money laundering. 'I am appalled by these serious allegations.' She said she had held talks with Rankin and stressed the importance of the recent inquiry into corruption on the Caribbean archipelago. Last year, the UK set up a commission of inquiry into mis-governance in the British overseas territory, which has heard allegations of systemic corruption, cronyism, jury intimidation and misuse of public funds. In his statement, Rankin said Fahie's arrest was the result of a US operation led by the US Drugs Enforcement Agency (DEA) and was not linked to the Commission of Inquiry (CoI) report. 'The remit of the Commission of Inquiry focused on governance and corruption, and was not a criminal investigation into the illegal drug trade. To avoid unnecessary speculation, I intend to move ahead urgently on publication of the inquiry report so the people of the BVI can see its contents and its recommendations in the areas it addressed,' he said. Addressing the commission of inquiry last year, Fahie denied that there was any corruption in the BVI. He said: 'The key to any country is its reputation, but so far, and thank God for that, there is no evidence provided in the CoI showing that the BVI is corrupt.'", "006e6e5354456e8fbb41c281467412ac060babaf99a90f053e94d5b5": "Elon Musk has sold $8.5bn (PS6.8bn) worth of shares in Tesla as the world's richest man raises cash after reaching a deal to buy Twitter. The Tesla chief executive has committed $21bn of his own money to the funding package for acquiring the social media platform, which he agreed to buy for $44bn on Monday. Since then Musk has sold 9.6m Tesla shares, or about 5.6% of his stake in the business, according to filings with the US financial regulator. Musk did not confirm the purpose of the sale but he took to his Twitter account late on Thursday to announce that he planned no further sales of shares in the electric carmaker 'after today'. Tesla stock had fallen sharply on Tuesday - wiping $126bn off the value of the company - amid investor concern that the world's richest man would offload stock in the company to help fund the all-cash deal for Twitter. After the latest share sale, Musk's Tesla stake is worth about $147bn and he remains the largest shareholder with a stake of about 15.6%. Alongside $21bn of his own cash, Musk is borrowing $12.5bn to fund the takeover. A bank consortium led by Morgan Stanley is providing a further $13bn. It was not immediately clear how the billionaire would raise the remaining equity financing. Musk holds a 43.6% stake in unlisted rocket company SpaceX, which is reportedly valued at $100bn. Musk's current wealth is about $250bn, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. The share sales were confirmed as it emerged that Elon Musk could charge websites a fee for quoting viral tweets from verified Twitter accounts if he completes the acquisition, according to a report. The Tesla chief executive is also considering a crackdown on executive pay and has a new chief executive lined up to replace the incumbent Parag Agrawal.  In an effort to convince banks to part-fund the takeover, Musk said he planned to grow revenue by developing new features such as charging for embedding or quoting popular tweets, said Reuters. This would involve charging a fee when a third-party website wants to quote or embed a tweet from verified individuals or organisations. Musk also told banks he could crack down on executive and board pay at the company, according to Reuters, as he sought to convince lenders that he could find the cashflow to service the debt underpinning the bid.  The report added that Musk does not have confidence in Agrawal and has an as-yet-unnamed candidate in mind to replace him. Agrawal replaced Jack Dorsey, Twitter's co-founder, in November last year but is to leave when the sale completes. Other changes to Twitter flagged by Musk in recent weeks include removing advertising from its premium service, Blue. Twitter makes 90% of its annual revenue of $5bn from advertising, although Blue is only available in a handful of countries including the US and Australia. The $13bn loan from banks is equivalent to seven times Twitter's 2022 projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. The sale of 9.6m shares, made at prices ranging from $872 to $999 a share, were the first by Musk since a spree late last year that raised more than $16bn, which came after he asked his more than 80 million Twitter followers whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla.", "8fd8fe012549424e807ca1e8d823986ec743ede1b1d4a54289fd1b05": "China's ministry of foreign affairs has accused Nato of messing up Europe and stirring up conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region, after the UK's foreign secretary told China it should 'play by the rules'. In a speech at Mansion House in London on Wednesday, Liz Truss renewed calls to boost Nato in the wake of the Ukraine war, and said the coordinated moves to isolate Russia from the world economy proved that market access to democratic countries was no longer a given. Truss also delivered a direct warning to China. 'Countries must play by the rules. And that includes China,' she said. On Thursday Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China's ministry of foreign affairs, dismissed Truss's comments and accused Nato of demanding other countries abide by basic norms while it has 'wantonly waged wars and dropped bombs in sovereign states, killing and displacing innocent civilians'. 'Nato, a military organisation in the North Atlantic, has in recent years come to the Asia-Pacific region to throw its weight around and stir up conflicts,' Wang said. 'Nato has messed up Europe. Is it now trying to mess up the Asia-Pacific and even the world?' In her speech Truss said Nato had to pre-empt threats in the Indo-Pacific and extend its outlook to democracies outside its membership, like Taiwan, which Beijing claims is a breakaway Chinese province it must retake. She suggested China's economic rise - now the world's second largest economy to Britain's sixth - could be targeted. '[China] will not continue to rise if they do not play by the rules. China needs trade with the G7. We [the Group of Seven] represent around half of the global economy. And we have choices,' Truss said. 'We have shown with Russia the kind of choices that we're prepared to make when international rules are violated.' China has refused to condemn the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, one of its closest allies, drawing criticism and urgings from European and other governments to use its influence on Moscow. A recent China-EU summit was reportedly strained as Chinese representatives rebuffed pressure by European counterparts to help end the war. Premier Li Keqiang said Beijing would pursue peace 'in its own way'. Beijing firmly opposes linking the Ukraine war to its relations with Moscow and has said it will defend the rights of Chinese individuals and companies. On Thursday Wang said China's position on the conflict had been 'consistent and clear'. 'We have always made independent judgments based on the merits of the case,' he said, adding no further detail. Truss has previously accused China and Russia being 'aggressors working in concert', telling Australian media she couldn't rule out China using Russia's invasion as an opportunity to launch its own act of aggression.", "5a96d3b0de48e25e12b4dff25208c14ecb929ac173b3429cbd6e1c02": "", "e0f1e90c6a7ead42662a1637972eb5065a1daa81e6b398bef54a857f": "Growing military tensions in the Pacific between China, the US and Australia do not address the most significant security threat to the region - climate change - former leaders of Pacific nations have warned. In a statement on Friday, the Pacific Elders Voice group, which includes former leaders of the Marshall Islands, Palau, Kiribati and Tuvalu, as well as Dame Meg Taylor, the former secretary general of the Pacific Islands Forum secretariat, said that 'the primary security threat to the Pacific is climate change', rather than geo-strategic tensions. 'The growing military tension in the Pacific region created by both China and the United States and its allies, including Australia, does little to address the real threat to the region caused by climate change,' it said. 'We are suffering from many insecurities in our region. It is time that the international community focus on these insecurities, particularly in the context of climate change. We call on all nations to respect the sovereignty of all Pacific Island countries and the right of Pacific peoples to develop and implement their own security strategies without undue coercion from outsiders.' Pacific countries have often been seen as the canary in the coalmine for the climate crisis, with the region suffering from king tides, catastrophic cyclones, increasing salinity, sustained droughts and the loss of low-lying islands to sea level rise among those most at threat from the climate crisis, with low-lying nations at risk from rising sea levels. Climate-induced migration has already begun from the Pacific, with people across the region forced to leave a number of island groups that are disappearing or becoming uninhabitable due to rising sea levels. Last year's report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said global heating above 1.5C would be 'catastrophic' for Pacific island nations and could lead to the loss of entire countries due to sea level rise within the century. Pacific leaders, including authors of the statement such as Hilda Heine Hilda, former president of the Marshall Islands, Enele Sopoaga, former prime minister of Tuvalu, and Anote Tong, former president of Kiribati, are among the strongest global leaders for climate action, and have pushed for ambitious action at international summits. The statement comes in the wake of news that China and Solomon Islands signed a secretive security agreement earlier this month. The deal has not been made public, but a draft of the deal was leaked online in March and provided China with the option to 'make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands', raising fears that it could lead to China establishing a military base in the islands. After news of the draft deal broke, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the US have all sent top-level delegations to Solomon Islands in ultimately unsuccessful efforts to persuade Solomon Islands' prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, not to sign it. After its signing, rhetoric has escalated, with the Biden administration saying the US would 'respond accordingly' if China was allowed to establish a long-term presence on the islands, while noting assurances from Sogavare that he had no intention of allowing a military base. Australia's prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia had 'the same red line' as the US when it came to China's involvement in Solomon Islands, and the defence minister, Peter Dutton, used his Anzac Day address to declare: 'Australia should prepare for war,' claiming that China was 'on a very deliberate course at the moment'. The former Pacific leaders voiced concerns that major powers including the US, Australia and Japan were developing policies for the region without consulting Pacific leaders, saying: 'The security and future of the Pacific must be determined primarily by Pacific Island countries and not by external powers competing over strategic interests within our region.' They also argued that major powers needed to address their own contribution to the climate crisis, which is an existential threat to many Pacific island states. 'These nations have done very little to address their own greenhouse gas emissions, despite statements of intent by the nations. Little has been done to address the impacts of climate change in the Pacific caused by their respective greenhouse gas emissions.' Some members of the Australian government have ridiculed suggestions that Canberra's unambitious climate policy may have contributed a loss of influence with Solomon Islands. 'That's a nonsense,' Morrison said last week. 'China has the biggest emissions and growing emissions in the world.'", "20f0837416837e947a857cdd813a3b3145be8d836b85dbf1b273ab9e": "Boris Johnson is under increasing pressure to take immediate disciplinary action against the Conservative MP accused of watching pornography in the House of Commons. The chief whip issued a statement on Wednesday suggesting the matter should be referred to parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), which deals with sexual harassment and other disciplinary matters. But senior Tories questioned why he had not taken action directly against the MP, whose alleged behaviour was witnessed by two female colleagues in recent months. The identity of the MP is known to party whips, it is understood, but sources denied suggestions the MP was himself a whip. One cabinet minister described the situation as 'madness all round', while Caroline Nokes, the chair of the women and equalities committee, said: 'I hope the chief withdraws the whip. In any other workplace they would be on gardening leave.' Chris Heaton-Harris, the chief whip, was present at a meeting of the '2022 committee' - a group of Tory women - earlier this week, when a series of incidents, including the MP watching pornography, were described. On Thursday the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, called on Johnson to bypass the potentially lengthy ICGS process, and discipline the MP directly. 'This is an unusual case because the Tory party knows who this individual is. I think that they should deal with it, and deal with it sooner rather than later ... They know who this is. They should take action now,' he said. Misogyny and sexism in parliament have come under close scrutiny in recent days, after a widely criticised Mail on Sunday story claimed Tory MPs believed Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, crossed and uncrossed her legs to distract Johnson at prime minister's questions. Asked whether the MP accused of watching pornography should lose the whip, the prime minister insisted on Thursday that the case should be investigated independently. It was 'obviously unacceptable for anybody to be doing that kind of thing in the workplace' but 'what needs to happen now is that the proper procedures need to be gone through, the independent complaints and grievances procedure needs to be activated and we need to get to understand the facts,' Johnson said. A spokesperson for the whips' office said: 'This is the best way of handling this, because they can look at everything fairly, independently. This is the best process that we could have in place to deal with this matter.' At least five cabinet ministers have expressed alarm privately or publicly about the reports. Earlier in the day, the attorney general, Suella Braverman, said some MPs behaved like 'animals', and talked about a 'coarsening' of behaviour in parliament and elsewhere. 'I think this is something that does happen in many, if not all, workplaces, where a small minority of men - and it is men - are behaving in an unacceptable way,' she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. 'I think that's actually a more worrying symptom of our society and our culture. How have we got to a place in our society where watching pornography on the tube, in public, in front of children, in parliament, in the workplace has become somehow normalised for some people?' Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, told the BBC: 'I've been around a while and I think it's actually getting worse [for female MPs] ... I always thought that, get more women in ... things will get better, but sadly I don't see that happening at the moment. I think we just need to have a majority of women maybe. So it's just disappointing.' Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said: 'There have been several instances of inappropriate and sexist behaviour recently in parliament. It is shameful. Parliamentarians are public servants and it is their duty to set an example of character and integrity. The culture of Westminster needs to change.'", "59b0df1fa9c5fcfcc4c8984da4bf2b639841d93a437b625d61d56d90": "Millions sweltered in a dangerous early summer heatwave across India and Pakistan that has led to power and water shortages as annual furnace-like temperatures hit South Asia. In New Delhi, a burning rubbish dump choked residents for a third day on Thursday as temperatures crossed 45C (113F) in parts of the region. Forecasters warn it will get even hotter this weekend. Heatwaves have killed more than 6,500 people in India since 2010, and scientists say climate change is making them harsher and more frequent across South Asia. 'This is the first time I've seen such horrible weather in April. Usually, we're prepared for this in May and onwards,' said 30-year-old Delhi housewife Somya Mehra, as she and her family thirstily searched for cold drinks. 'Today we stepped out because of our anniversary but otherwise I'm not stepping out at all. I've stopped sending my kid out to play.' The Indian states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh imposed power cuts on factories as consumption for air conditioning and fans rocketed. Media reports said power stations were also facing shortages of coal, the main source of electricity in the nation of 1.4 billion people. Many regions also reported falling water supplies that will only worsen until the annual monsoon rains in June and July. Water shortages will hit farmers hardest, including those growing wheat as India aims to boost exports to help ease a global shortage due to the war in Ukraine. Several parts of India should expect no relief in the coming days. 'Heatwave conditions are likely to prevail over the northern plains as well as the central parts of the country throughout this week' while 'severe heatwave conditions' were forecast for west Rajasthan on 1-2 May, the India Meteorological Department said on Thursday in a weather review. Temperatures are expected to be up to 8C higher than usual in parts of Pakistan, with the mercury peaking at 48C in parts of rural Sindh on Wednesday, Pakistan's Meteorological Society warned. Farmers have to use water sparingly in a country where agriculture is the mainstay of the economy and accounts for about 40% of the workforce. 'Public health and agriculture in the country will face serious threats due to the extreme temperature this year,' climate change minister Sherry Rehman said. Last month was the hottest March on record since 1961, the Pakistani met office said. Coming during the month of Ramadan, the heat makes fasting in both India and Pakistan even tougher for Muslims, who shun even water during daylight hours. 'Temperatures are rising rapidly in the country, and rising much earlier than usual,' India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, said on Wednesday, adding that India has seen 'increasing incidents of fires in various places - in forests, important buildings and in hospitals - in the past few days'. In New Delhi, a 60-metre-high (200ft) rubbish mountain has been ablaze since Tuesday, while firefighting teams battle it with lorry-loads of sand and mud. The inferno, belching toxic black smoke that engulfed nearby districts, was the fourth such incident at a landfill site in the megacity of 20 million people in less than a month. Pradeep Khandelwal, the former head of Delhi's waste management, said they were likely sparked by warmer temperatures speeding up the decomposition of organic waste. 'The dry and hot weather produces excess methane gas at the dumping sites that trigger such fires,' Khandelwal told AFP. 'Before human activities increased global temperatures, we would have seen the heat that hit India earlier this month around once in 50 years,' said Mariam Zachariah, from the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London.

While panic over inflation has led news agendas all over the world, the IMF's World Economic Outlook released this week estimated it would reach 8.7% in developing economies compared with 5.7% in rich countries. Experts fear millions more will be driven into poverty and that transport and food networks will be affected. Humanitarian efforts for refugees and populations already facing hunger crises could also struggle to cope with increased prices, at a time when many are already coping with reduced aid funding. 'The rising cost of getting aid into areas like north-west Syria, which is hugely dependent on humanitarian aid, means that it's the people who need help most who are suffering,' said Jessica Adams, head of communications at Syria Relief. 'Our costs in meeting the needs have gone up - petrol for trucking water into camps costs more, building homes for displaced Syrians in tents costs more as building materials have gone up. This is against a backdrop where donations to Syria are reducing - so in a conflict like Syria ... living has become unaffordable.' The effects of the Ukraine war on oil, and the energy sector as a whole, are being monitored by experts but prices have fluctuated wildly since Russia's invasion and there is concern about how much oil is being refined and exported as the products ordinary people need. Rising oil prices are being felt on the forecourts, with petrol up 63% in Sudan, 50% in Sierra Leone and 42% in Ghana compared with 9% in Britain. 'You cannot isolate oil from the other markets - gas prices are higher, coal prices are higher, food prices are higher and you have supply-chain bottlenecks. There are a lot of headwinds that are affecting economics all over the world,' said Bassam Fattouh, director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. 'If you look at it from a consumer's point of view, they are being hit left and right all over the world.' Oxfam has estimated that a quarter of a billion people face poverty this year because of rising food and fuel prices, calling it 'the most profound collapse of humanity into extreme poverty and suffering in memory'. The UN's agencies raised concerns about how rising food and fuel costs will affect their operations, predicting a $136m rise in operational costs in West Africa. In east Africa it has warned of refugee families getting into debt and selling off their belongings because they fear ration cuts. The UN warned last week of developing countries becoming 'collateral damage' of the Ukraine war. 'The developing countries are facing a perfect storm of soaring food and fuel prices with already limited fiscal space and high debt ratios. We need urgent measures to prevent great human suffering and the world tipping into an era of social and political unrest,' said Rebeca Grynspan, secretary general of the UN conference on trade and development (Unctad). The IMF said the war was derailing post-pandemic economic recovery and estimated global growth would slow from 6.1% last year to 3.6% in 2022. It also said the pandemic had increased debt because of response spending, making vulnerable countries reliant on oil and food imports. In Sri Lanka, the lack of foreign currency reserves has sparked a movement to bring down the government, which has struggled to import food, medicine and fuel, leading to blackouts and farmers struggling to transport crops. In Peru there have been anti-government protests over fuel and fertiliser prices, while Egypt has tried to avert similar anger with price controls, punishing non-compliant bakeries and retailers with closure. Living costs helped fuel the anti-government demonstrations that brought down Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019 and similar protests have emerged against the military rulers who took control in a coup last October. Kholood Khair, of Sudanese thinktank Insight Strategy Partners, said the rise in food and fuel prices is adding to the grievances being voiced by protesters. 'Gas prices have been rising steadily in the past few months at the same time as the government has been struggling to retain hard currency in the central bank to buy more ... the government has very acute supply problems,' said Khair, who added that many of the fuel subsidies have been removed since Bashir's exit.

Committing to a specific writing goal is a condition of admission, as is an understanding that leaving in a fit of pique is out of the question before the task at hand has been completed. The cafe charges 150 Japanese yen ($1.15) for the first 30 minutes and then 300 an hour after that. Although a few people have stayed past the official closing time, they have all eventually finished their work, the proprietor, Takuya Kawai, said. The snug, 10-seat cafe provides unlimited self-service refills of tea and coffee, high-speed wifi, docking ports and tall chairs that positively discourage slouching or nodding off. This week, my editors asked me to put the cafe's unique selling point to the test. Would I while away my two-hour session flitting between a near-empty Word file, email and social media sites, or, as I promised Kawai, make some headway with this article? Customers must write their name, writing goals and the time they plan to finish. They can also ask Kawai to nag them about their progress. Those who ask for the 'mild' option will simply be asked how they got on when they pay at the end of the session; others in need of a heavier dose of discipline can expect him to occasionally stand behind them, although he insists he makes no value judgments on the contents of their laptop screen. The mild-mannered 52-year-old, who is a technical writer when he is not cajoling his customers to buckle down, dismissed concerns among some social media users that his tactics were heavy-handed. 'Instead of monitoring them, I'm here to support them,' he said. 'As a result, what they thought would take a day was actually completed in three hours, or tasks that usually take three hours were done in one.' Seated to my left, Shizuku Kino conceded that she was struggling. The manga artist had arrived more than two hours earlier, but had so far drawn a blank. 'It's nothing to do with the environment, I just can't come up with any good ideas at the moment. It's not that I can't concentrate ... the fact that I haven't got anything done is my problem.' Uhyou Kitami, with whom Kino has collaborated on a manga series, was faring better. 'I've made quite a lot of progress,' she said of her first visit to the cafe. 'It's not that the atmosphere inspires you ... once you sit down you have no alternative but to get on with it.' Kawai, who opened the cafe earlier this month, believes its location on the corner of a busy street is perfectly suited to unleashing torrents of creativity. 'After we opened, I played jazz to drown out the sound of people tapping their keyboards, but in fact the noise from the traffic and people outside is at just the right level for that. You don't want the absolute silence of a library or home ... here people can draw on the energy of the neighbourhood.' After initial doubts about whether the concept would work in a city packed with themed cafes, he has been taken aback by the response. 'People were pleased when they told me they had met their deadline or word count for the day. And that made me happy too.' My two hours at the cafe flew past, mercifully free of the dreaded afternoon slump. My screen was filled with a draft - albeit a very rough one - of this article. As I left, I wished Kino luck with her deadline. She turned and nodded her thanks, but her hands didn't leave her keyboard. The ideas were finally flowing.", "c96ff95587f944b25cc3f906a009a2168168c464c6f246fa1e207cf3": "", "f11d5245f59ef53c5e67664a6f29a8db192a04b9a7b4fec217615aa4": "", "5e0d9c98fba5615ae6ce57fcb0fb7b6ab05b29159e5e71f325c34bba": "Nicknamed 'grey ghosts' for their lustrous silver scales, remarkable stealth and speed, bonefish can swim at up to 40mph. This species, protected by catch-and-release laws in the US, is revered by anglers around the world, many of whom visit Florida to seek the elusive fish. But evidence points to a steep drop in bonefish numbers in south Florida. Populations have fallen more than 50% over four decades, according to estimates by researchers. Dr Jennifer Rehage, a fish ecologist and associate professor at Florida International University (FIU), has spoken to many anglers about the fish's disappearance from Florida's seagrass flats: 'They've said to me: 'I've fished [bonefish] all my life and I can't find them. I haven't seen a bonefish in five years, and it's freaking me out'.' For the past three years, Rehage has been leading a study to find out why, and has discovered something that might help explain it: pharmaceuticals. Of the 93 bonefish she and her team sampled, all tested positive for at least one pharmaceutical, including heart medications, opioids, antifungals and antidepressants, according to the results of the study, published in February. In 56% of fish, researchers detected pharmaceutical quantities at levels 'above which we expect negative effects', according to the study. One bonefish sampled in Key West tested positive for 17 pharmaceuticals - eight of them antidepressants that were up to 300 times above the human therapeutic level. Pharmaceutical exposure in south Florida's bonefish was 'widespread and concerning', the study concluded. The researchers also studied 125 animals that bonefish prey on, including shrimp, crabs and small fish. Each contained an average of 11 pharmaceutical contaminants, indicating that the contamination is not limited to bonefish. While more is known about the potential impacts of pharmaceutical pollution in freshwater, marine impacts have been far less studied. There is still not enough information to directly link bonefish decline with drugs, but 'the potential for pharmaceuticals to be a problem [for fish in the sea] is formidable and concerning', Rehage says. Nearly 5bn medications are prescribed annually in the US alone, and the average American has about 12 prescriptions a year. Pharmaceuticals reach the water in various ways, including through manufacturing and rainwater run-off, but human and livestock wastewater is one of the main causes - especially what humans send down the toilet. The specific health consequences of pharmaceutical contamination on marine life are not yet fully understood but there is evidence of multiple negative effects. '[It] can provoke several consequences, mainly on the behaviour of fish, but it can also affect their ability to reproduce and their endocrine system,' says Elena Fabbri, a professor at the department of biological, geological and environmental sciences at Bologna University in Italy. In 2013, scientists from Umea University in Sweden - which partnered with FIU on the bonefish study - found that wild perch were less fearful and more antisocial when exposed to anti-anxiety medications, which could affect feeding and breeding. A 2016 study by the same university found salmon exposed to this medication swam faster and had riskier behaviour. Crayfishes' exposure to antidepressants has been linked to altered behaviour, increasing their boldness and the time they spent foraging, potentially making them more vulnerable to predators. There are three main ways wastewater ends up in the sea, says Rachel Silverstein, director of the environmental organisation Miami Waterkeeper: sewage spills, discharge of treated wastewater into the ocean and malfunctioning septic tanks. These have all been major problems in Florida. In 2020, 212m US gallons (800m litres) of sewage spilled into Fort Lauderdale's waterways. 'Though most contamination is screened out at sewage treatment plants, it's very hard to remove some of these pharmaceuticals from the water,' Silverstein says. In addition, more than half of the septic tanks in Miami-Dade county are not filtering waste properly due to rising sea levels, creating an environmental and public health hazard, she says. Silverstein sees FIU's study as 'further evidence that we need to make urgent changes to upgrade our infrastructure to continue living in this region and protecting our economic and environmental interests'. The problem is not limited to Florida. Experts say there is an urgent need to improve wastewater infrastructure globally to remove pharmaceuticals before they reach the ocean. Implementing an additional step in wastewater management known as 'ozonation' could help, Rehage says. The technique adds ozone to the water to help remove contaminants that are often missed by traditional wastewater treatment, including pharmaceuticals and pesticides. But not enough countries are retrofitting plants to incorporate this step, she says, pointing to Switzerland, Sweden and Germany as among the only countries 'that are actually dealing with this issue of pharmaceuticals'. Improved wastewater management is important, but the pharmaceutical industry itself also has a responsibility to tackle the issue by exploring greener alternatives, Fabbri says. 'We cannot ban these substances because we need them, but we could favour or push pharmaceutical industries to find greener alternatives.' This could include producing drugs that break down faster in the environment. There are political moves to understand more about the impact of drugs on waterways. In 2019, for example, the EU adopted a 'strategic plan' to address the risks from pharmaceutical pollution in the environment. But many such initiatives focus more on the impact on freshwater environments. As further research points to the impact of pharmaceuticals in the ocean, Fabbri says: 'We must continue publishing about this subject to inform regulatory agencies that there is a need for these regulations in marine environments as well.'  For now, researchers say there is a long way to go in the US. 'The control of chemicals entering our environment has always been reactive,' says Aaron Adams, director of science and conservation at the Bonefish & Tarpon Trust, the conservation organisation that commissioned the FIU study. 'No legal limits exist for the control of pollution from pharmaceuticals during manufacture, use nor disposal,' the report noted. Nick Castillo, a PhD student at FIU and co-author of the study, says standardised metrics are needed to assess the effects of drugs on exposed organisms. Currently, he points out, these 'antiquated' environmental regulations tend to ignore pharmaceuticals 'because they aren't lethal'. Studying the impacts of pharmaceuticals in waterways has always focused heavily on freshwater, Rehage says: 'This is one of the first studies to go into marine coastal environments and over a large area to show that pharmaceuticals are everywhere.'

At a press conference in Poland after a surprise visit to Kyiv, Lloyd Austin was asked if he would now define US goals differently from those set out soon after the Russian invasion. In response, he started out with the established administration line about helping Ukraine retain its sovereignty and defend its territory. Then Austin added a second goal: 'We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.' That meant Russia should 'not have the capability to very quickly reproduce' the forces and equipment that had been lost in Ukraine. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, estimated those losses on Monday as a quarter of Russia's pre-invasion strength, with more than 2,000 armoured vehicles knocked out, including at least 530 tanks, as well as 60 aircraft. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who travelled with Austin to see Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv, agreed with his formulation of US objectives, saying: 'I think the secretary said it very well'. The two officials were talking as the first howitzers from the latest tranche of US military supplies began arriving in Ukraine, and $165m in supplies of 'non-standard' ex-Soviet compatible ammunition was announced. The remarks suggested that even if Russian forces withdrew or were expelled from the Ukrainian territory they have occupied since 24 February, the US and its allies would seek to maintain sanctions with the aim of stopping Russia reconstituting its forces. It also indicated Washington is taking a position in an internal debate within Nato on whether to use the opportunity of Vladimir Putin's strategic blunder in Ukraine to try to hobble his ability to threaten other countries in the future. 'The balance in Nato itself has shifted,' Rajan Menon, the director of the grand strategy programme at the Defense Priorities thinktank, said. 'The argument now seems to be this is not just about Ukraine; it's about a larger problem, that is the threat that Russia poses to Europe as a whole. And if you look at it that way, then these comments begin to make sense.' 'The Russians are on the retreat, so you have this flush of optimism which has moved the goalposts,' Menon, professor emeritus in international relations at Columbia University, said. 'Once Washington says it, those in Nato who want the war to be about that are empowered, because what the US says matters.' A European diplomat said it was unclear whether the remarks reflected a new decision or 'a clearer articulation' of an existing position. 'I think it's fundamentally about trying to get on the front foot in this crisis. There's a lot of domestic criticism of the administration for being passive,' the diplomat said. 'All of this is swirling around at the moment in the administration, as they work out exactly how forward they want to be.' If the remarks do indeed represent the Biden administration's aims, there is a separate question of whether it was sensible to declare them so bluntly. It arguably weakens Russia's incentive to withdraw, reinforces Moscow's narrative that Nato is waging a proxy war in Ukraine aimed at weakening Russia and even regime change, deepening Putin's paranoia. 'If I was writing the secretary's talking points, I would prefer he said: our goal is that Ukraine wins, rather than our goal is to weaken Russia because they are two sides of the same coin, but one would have been much more aligned with what the administration has been saying,' said Alina Polyakova, the president of the Center for European Policy Analysis, said. 'Certainly this will be used by the Russian state media to double down on the narrative that we've already seen from the Russian government, that the US is 'out to get us', that they want to destroy Russia,' she said, but added: 'Frankly, I don't think we should worry too much about how this will be spun by the Russian media, because they can spin anything.' Ultimately, Polyakova said, Austin was voicing a widespread feeling about the long-term threat posed by Putin that is increasingly difficult to ignore. 'I think the secretary's comments were truthful in that it will be in the greater interest of global stability and European security not to have a military aggressive state, bordering Nato or bordering Europe,' she said. 'I think that's very obvious.'", "731615b978ddf636e3fa00c4367702e419a117f46e4421847b7ba505": "Whichever way you cut it - and as obvious as the observation may sound - the runoff vote that returned Emmanuel Macron to the Elysee Palace for a second term, with a score of 58.5% to Marine Le Pen's 41.5%, showed France to be a divided country. But it's complicated. Geographically, first. The vote for what was Jean-Marie Le Pen's Front National and is now his daughter's Rassemblement National (RN) has long been analysed this way, but the far-right party's gradual normalisation has made this less salient. France's post-vote map shows Macron broadly enjoying support in Paris, the west, south-west and centre of the country, while Le Pen won overwhelmingly in swathes of her north and north-eastern heartlands and the Mediterranean south. It's traditional also to note that the RN does better in struggling rural and outer suburban France, and Macron duly won the big cities, scoring more than 80% in Paris, Nantes, Rennes and Bordeaux and 70%-plus in Lyon, Strasbourg, Toulouse and Lille. But the president's vote held up pretty well in a lot of smaller towns, too, and in many parts of the countryside Le Pen - although her scores there were generally higher - only managed to draw level. It looks a more complex picture than it used to be. 'The biggest divides are above all generational and social,' said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling company. 'A look at detailed commune-by-commune map shows the rural-urban split really does not correspond to reality.' So what were those generational divides? Again according to Ipsos's data, the youngest voters, aged 18 to 24, voted 61% for Macron - although 41% in that age bracket did not vote at all - with the 25-34-year-olds and 35-49-year-olds following suit, but by smaller margins: 51% and 53%. The fiftysomethings - perhaps the generation most alarmed by Macron's pension plans - broke narrowly for Le Pen at 51%-49%, while the 60- and 70-pluses, with the most to lose from her economic policies, plumped 59% and 71% for Macron and turned out to vote in by far the largest numbers. 'So what we have is an older France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron, and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote,' the political analyst Jerome Jaffre said. 'It's a major sociological gulf.' In terms of income, the voting data broadly paints a picture of a wealthier, well-educated and contented France that voted for the incumbent, and a less well-off, less well-educated and discontented France that cast its ballots for Le Pen. According to the pollsters Elabe, 59% of voters who said they were 'struggling to make ends meet' voted for the far-right contender; 41% opted for Macron. Of those who said they had no financial struggles, 66% chose Macron and 34% Le Pen. Ipsos's data on employment reflects the same broad picture: 59% of independent professionals, 77% of senior management, 59% of junior managers, teachers and healthcare workers, and 69% of pensioners voted Macron, whereas 57% of regular employees and 67% of blue-collar workers chose Le Pen. Almost 75% of voters with a degree or other higher education qualification voted for the centrist incumbent, while more than 60% of those who did not have their baccalaureat, or secondary-school leaving exam, chose Le Pen. There was another divide: those who voted - including those who did so reluctantly - and those who, forced to choose between two candidates they disliked, did not. Turnout was just 72%, with abstentions at their highest in any second-round runoff vote in France since Georges Pompidou won in 1969. What's more, 8.6% of those who turned up at polling stations on Sunday went to the trouble of not casting a ballot for either candidate, with 6.35% voting 'blank' - not putting a ballot paper in their envelope - and 2.25% spoiling their ballot. Taken together that means more than a third of registered voters in France - about 15 million people - did not express a choice. A 72% turnout may sound high by British or US standards, but it means Macron was elected by barely 38.5% of the electorate, and many of those who voted for him did so mainly stop the far right winning. All of this makes Macron's second term even more challenging than his first. Often accused of being 'president of the rich', he must prioritise policies that rebuild ties with those voters who stayed away or lent him their vote solely to block Le Pen. It's not just about policies, though. France might also be somewhat less divided if it did not have a two-round electoral system that left large parts of the population feeling wildly under-represented - as they will, again, in June's parliamentary vote. To make it to the second round, candidate MPs must score at least 12.5%, a bar that in the last parliament saw Le Pen's party win just eight of the national assembly's 577 seats and Jean-Luc Melenchon's far-left La France Insoumise (Unbowed France) 17. That's plainly recipe for division and conflict. Macron has promised to look into introducing more proportional representation into France's politics, a measure that would necessarily promote compromise and consensus. Divided France's voters need, as much as anything else, political choice.", "c0a5680057c4124a89280d7cbe1e676b16f907ca25926e8849701893": "The buskers are out, hotels are full, archaeological sites are heaving, shopkeepers are smiling, and good luck if you want a table in a decent restaurant. It might be April but Athens is alive to the sound of tourists. In all his years keeping watch over 1st-century BC ruins, Stelios Ballas, who is in his 50s, can barely recall so many visitors picking their way through the scattered antiquities of the Roman agora. 'These past few weeks have been something else,' he says from his guard's cabin nestled under a plane tree. 'I talk to some of them and they seem to be from everywhere. The thing is, do they have money and are they willing to spend it?' Around the corner on Adrianou Street, the Greek capital's oldest commercial thoroughfare, restaurateurs are not asking that question - for now. Not since 2019, when Greece attracted a record 33 million holidaymakers, has business been as good. 'If it goes on like this we'll be talking about a brilliant year,' smiles Vassilis Stathokostopoulos, who runs the recently upgraded all-day bistro Ydria. 'Perhaps it's our new chef but people are not only coming, it's clear that after everything we've all been through, they want to have a good time. And for that they're willing to dig deep into their pockets.' In a country so dependent on tourism - the sector accounts for 25% of Greece's economic output and one in four jobs - the rebound has surprised even those who are in the business of being optimistic. Athens has seen more upheaval in recent years than other EU metropolises, hit first by a near decade-long financial crisis that made its streets synonymous with protests and riots before the coronavirus struck. The pandemic-induced hiatus resulted in tourist revenues dropping from EUR18.2bn in 2019 to EUR4bn in 2020 when, in a record slump, the nation logged only 7 million arrivals. Although earnings from the industry exceeded EUR10bn, better than expected, last year when Greece opened its borders in May, they were still well short of pre-pandemic takings. But this year, despite the unexpected spectre of war returning to Europe in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, industry figures are confident that recovery has finally come. For the first time since 2019 cruise ships are pulling into Greek ports - testimony, say industry officials, to the desire of travellers to put the pandemic behind them. Pre-paid flight bookings are also on the rise. 'All omens look positive,' says Andreas Andreadis, a former tourism boss and chief executive of the phenomenally successful Sani/Ikos group of luxury resorts. 'For a few weeks after the start of the war in Ukraine demand dropped but since the end of March it has picked up and is now excellent.' Holidaymakers, he says, are still less inclined given the spread of Covid to travel long-haul, preferring destinations in Europe. 'And the truth is there are not so many options with quality destinations,' he says. In an unprecedented step aimed at capitalising on the hunger of people to travel, the tourist season kicked off earlier in Greece this year. Last week, officials announced that pandemic restrictions, including the requirement of presenting an EU digital Covid certificate to enter the Mediterranean nation, would be lifted from 1 May and reviewed in September. What was seen as Athens' relatively successful handling of the pandemic last year has also helped revive the sector, despite public health authorities registering a sharp rise in Covid deaths since because of lower vaccination rates. 'The season has begun earlier than ever before,' says Vasilis Kikilias, the Greek tourism minister, noting that the first direct flight from the US, a key market for the economy, flew in on 7 March. 'It's a vote of confidence in our country.' The decision to open earlier appears to have paid off: bookings soared over Easter. As Greeks also prepare to mark the holiday - returning en masse to their ancestral villages for the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic to celebrate the most important religious event in the Orthodox calendar - authorities say they show no sign of tapering off. Airlines, says Kikilias, are not only competing over slots to Greece this summer, but 765 cruise ships are lined up to anchor in ports around the country, with popular island destinations such as Mykonos, Kos and Corfu already drawing crowds. 'It's a fact borne out by every study that people don't just want to travel, they need to travel,' says Eugenios Vasilikos, the vice-president of the Panhellenic Federation of Hoteliers. 'All the signs point to this being a very good year.' By 2023, the capital will have acquired an additional 5,000 hotel rooms compared with 2019 when a city once bypassed for the islands managed to attract 5 million visitors. The investment frenzy, evident in a construction boom now changing the face of downtown Athens, is also indicative of the hopes entrepreneurs have placed in the revival of Greece's heavy industry. But Vasilikos, at the hoteliers' federation, concedes there is little room for complacency. The glimpse of a carefree world that has revisited Athens as tourists amble through its sites and streets is also fraught with the dangers inherent in a cost of living crisis and spiralling inflation rates being felt globally. Unions representing Greeks who earn some of the lowest wages in the European Union have taken to the streets. 'A few weeks ago I might not have been so optimistic,' he says of reservations in the capital. 'All the data points to last-minute bookings in our hotels which while costs are rising also have some of the lowest price rates in Europe. People aren't sure of anything any more. They wait until the last minute, and, in the last minute, anything can change.'", "a16b5f7a9c3c0be6d3fd1394d94b92e33b02cbc616122344659be54d": "The number of coal-fired power plants under development around the world fell last year, but far too much coal is still being burned and too many new coal-fired power plants are planned for the world to stay within safe temperature limits. Coal use appeared to be in long-term decline before the Covid-19 pandemic, but lockdowns around the world and economic upheaval drove an increase in new coal projects in 2020, particularly in China. Last year, the total coal power capacity in development fell sharply again, by about 13%, from 525GW to 457GW, a record low for new plants under development, according to a report from Global Energy Monitor published on Tuesday. The number of countries planning new plants also fell, from 41 at the beginning of 2021 to 34 countries. But these encouraging signs were outweighed by a slowdown in older coal-fired power stations being taken out of service. About 25GW of capacity was taken out - roughly equal to the amount of new capacity commissioned in China - and the amount of electricity generated from coal rose by 9% in 2021 to a record high, more than rebounding from a 4% fall in 2020 when Covid first struck. The authors of the report concluded that 'coal's last gasp is not yet in sight', despite countries agreeing at the Cop26 UN climate summit last November to a 'phase down' of coal. Last year, the International Energy Agency warned that no new exploration of fossil fuels of any kind could take place if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The continuing use of coal comes despite ever starker warnings from scientists in the latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which concluded that the world would far exceed the 1.5C limit without rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Flora Champenois of Global Energy Monitor, one of the report's authors, said: 'The coal plant pipeline is shrinking, but there is simply no carbon budget left to be building new coal plants. We need to stop now. The latest IPCC report's directive for a fighting chance at a livable climate is clear - stop building new coal plants and retire existing ones in the developed world by 2030, and the rest of the world soon after.' The war in Ukraine has also taken a toll, pushing up gas prices and making coal cheaper by comparison, tempting companies and countries to burn more of the dirtiest fuel. But Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst for the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, and another co-author of the report, said there could also be an upside in that many countries - particularly in Europe - were looking to reform their energy systems to accelerate clean energy and emphasise energy efficiency. 'It's really important to note how much movement there has been towards clean energy and efficiency in response to the invasion,' he said. Weakening demand in China was also dampening the prospects of a further coal revival, he added. The country's response to the current resurgence of Covid-19, and to the uncertain global economy, would be crucial. 'The question is whether China does go for the high-quality economic growth that the leadership has been talking about.' China has commissioned more new coal-fired power than the rest of the world combined since the Covid-19 pandemic started, but the Chinese government's plans for increasing clean electricity production by 2025 should mean that less coal is used, even if new coal-fired power plants are built there. But the building of such plants must be controlled much more strictly, according to the report, or growing over-capacity could hurt the country's transition. Globally, there are still more than 2,400 coal-fired power plants operating in 79 countries, making a total of nearly 2,100 GW of capacity. Only 170 plants are not covered by an eventual phase-out date or carbon-neutrality target, but too few are scheduled to retire in time to stay within 1.5C.", "d53a386b0cfc0a2579b90acbc16fee5c42f97c1ca8f9665f64c69949": "In 2019, Ikea announced it had developed curtains that it claimed could 'break down common indoor air pollutants'. The secret, it said, was the fabric's special coating. 'What if we could use textiles to clean the air?' asked Ikea's product developer, Mauricio Affonso, in a promotional video for the 'Gunrid' curtains. After explaining that the coating was a photocatalyst ('similar to photosynthesis, found in nature'), Affonso is shown gazing up at the gauzy curtains while uplifting music plays. 'It's amazing to work on something that can give people the opportunity to live a healthier life at home.'Puzzled by these claims - how could a mineral coating clean the air? - Avicenn, a French environmental nonprofit organisation, investigated. Independent laboratory tests of the Gunrid textile reported that samples contained tiny particles of titanium dioxide (TiO2) - a substance not normally toxic but which can be possibly carcinogenic if inhaled, and potentially in other forms - which supposedly gives 'self-cleaning' properties to things such as paint and windows when exposed to sunlight. These tiny particles, or nanoparticles, are at the forefront of materials science. Nanoparticles come in all shapes - spheres, cubes, fibres or sheets - but the crucial thing is their size: they are smaller than 100 nanometres (a human hair is approximately 80,000nm thick). Many nanoparticles exist in nature. Nano-hairs make a gecko's feet sticky, and nano-proteins make a spider's silk strong. But they can be manufactured, and because they are so small, they have special properties that make them attractive across a range of endeavours - not just to companies such as Ikea. In medicine, they can transport cancer drugs directly into tumour cells, and nanosilver is used to coat medical breathing tubes and bandages. Nanos could direct pesticides to parts of a plant, or release nutrients from fertilisers in a more controlled manner. They also have more mundane uses. Synthetic nanos are added to cosmetics and food. Nanosilver is used in textiles, where it is claimed to give antibacterial properties to plasters, gym leggings, yoga mats and period pants.  But scientists such as those at Avicenn are concerned that when these household items get washed, recycled or thrown away, synthetic nanos are released into the environment - making their way into the soil and sea in ways that are still not understood. Some scientists believe nanoparticles could pose an even greater threat than microplastics. Synthetic nano particles of plastic have been found in the ocean and in ice on both poles. Nanoparticles from socks and sunscreen have been found to pollute water, and certain nanos have been shown to negatively affect marine wildlife including fish and crustaceans. As with antibiotics, resistance to antimicrobial nanosilver can develop - silver-tolerant soil bacteria have now been found. Little is known even about where nanoparticles are, let alone their effects on the environment. As they are so tiny, most experiments are conducted in labs, and it can be hard to pin down where they are applied. 'The main problem with these substances is that we cannot measure them - we know they are there but they're so tiny they're difficult to detect, which is why you don't hear as much about them,' says Nick Voulvoulis, professor of environmental technology at Imperial College London. He worries about the uncontrolled use of nanos in consumer products. 'If nanos are used properly in applications that are useful or beneficial, that's justified, but if they are used anywhere and everywhere because they have certain properties, that's crazy.' Synthetic nanoparticles are not inherently harmful. Like their natural cousins, many are metal-based, but they can be made of any substance. Crucially, unlike chemical compounds, they cannot be dissolved. Their tiny size gives them, paradoxically, an enormous surface area, which makes them behave differently to 'non-nano' versions of the same material. It can make them more mobile, more reactive - and potentially more toxic, depending on shape, size, type, how a substance is released into the environment and its concentration. And released into the environment they are, on a massive scale. According to Avicenn, the release of nanos is most likely during manufacture or disposal, but it can also happen when items are washed - which is known to occur with fabrics containing nanosilver. Sewage systems cannot trap them and they end up in the ocean: the OECD says even advanced wastewater-treatment plants cannot deal with nanoparticles. From a health perspective, inhalation is the most harmful route of exposure to nanos such as TiO2 for factory workers and consumers. Avicenn's tests concluded that the average particle size was 4.9nm, and all 300 particles analysed were below the official nano threshold of 100nm. Ikea insisted its own tests showed the TiO2 particles were 'properly bound to the fabric' and 'pose no risk' to customers, and said it took workers' safety extremely seriously. The firm has not referred to them as nanoparticles, and said that once integrated into textile surfaces there was 'no good standard method to measure the particle size distribution of a material', acknowledging that EU definitions of nanomaterials were under review. 'We recognise that the tests and measurements of nano-particles are complex, especially for materials containing particles that tend to form agglomerates,' it said. As for Ikea's curtains shedding TiO2 nanoparticles when washed or discarded, Ikea said it was 'confident that the treatment is properly bound to the fabric, and therefore we do not see a risk of inhaling the treatment', but acknowledged that 'as with any textile, parts of the textile can come off during use or washing'. Many nanos do not persist for long in the environment. However, because they are consistently being discharged, levels remain fairly constant. 'Nanos are 'pseudo-persistent' because they degrade quite quickly but they keep entering the environment,' Voulvoulis says. His main concern is whether nanos become carriers for other compounds, a subject of scientific debate. In 2009, Spanish scientists suggested nanos could bind to and transport toxic pollutants, and possibly be toxic themselves by generating reactive free radicals. If other toxic pollutants 'latch on' to nanos' surfaces, they argued, marine plants and animals could absorb them more easily. Other scientists suggest the opposite: that organic matter in sewage coat nanoparticles, rendering them less active. And others fear nanos could trigger 'toxic cocktail' effects - making them more harmful in combination than individual substances would be separately. So far, synthetic nanomaterials are relatively dispersed in the sea, and unlikely to significantly affect marine animals, says Dr Tobias Lammel of Gothenburg University, who has studied copper nanos. But he warns: 'It's possible that the concentration of some manufactured nanomaterials in the marine environment will increase ... It is important to keep an eye on this.' Given the huge question marks, Avicenn wants more stringent regulations on nanos, and more caution in product design. 'Companies are eager to sell innovative and fancy products, but they must thoroughly assess their benefits-risks balance at each step of the life-cycle of the products,' says Mathilde Detcheverry, Avicenn's policy manager. From August, the EU will ban use of TiO2 nanos in food (where it is called E171) and the European Commission recently announced that 12 nanomaterials would soon be prohibited in cosmetics.  Detcheverry says: 'As scientific knowledge about the environmental and health impacts of engineered nanos such as silver and titanium dioxide advances, we need to make sure nanos are only allowed for specific and essential uses in order to minimise any adverse effects at the source and [ensure they are] not released uncontrollably.'  Two years after the release of Ikea's Gunrid curtains, Avicenn tried to buy more for further tests, but they had been withdrawn from sale. Ikea told the Guardian that Gunrid remained 'safe to use as a traditional curtain' but it was withdrawn because 'the functionality was not as effective as expected'. If that's true - for example, that despite TiO2 having proven photocatalytic properties and being used in self-cleaning and air-purifying products, its efficacy on curtains could be localised and not powerful - then at the very least Ikea's experience suggests nanoparticles' benefits may not outweigh the potential and frequently unknown risks, Detcheverry says. 'Nanoparticles are often promoted as silver bullets against pollution or bacteria,' she says, 'but we must make sure that the cure is not worse than the disease.' Gunrid was just one product of many thousands that use nanoparticles. As Ikea's Affonso says in the video: 'What's so great about Gunrid is that this technology could be applied to any textile.'", "3f86dd8f76120b276542ce5825cc27d3d3a6c8d284211eb0fced9b64": "Elon Musk said Twitter must be 'politically neutral' in a comment posted last night after a wave of account deletions by left-leaning users on the social media network. In the days since Musk's $44bn (PS34.5bn) acquisition offer was accepted by Twitter's board, hundreds of thousands of users have closed their accounts on the site, the company confirmed, leading to a dip in follower numbers for left-leaning politicians and celebrities such as Barack and Michelle Obama, Taylor Swift and Jeremy Corbyn. Meanwhile, rightwing influencers such as the far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Boris Johnson and Ted Cruz have all had large gains as new users sign up for the service. In the latest of a series of tweets about the platform Musk hopes to take into private ownership, the world's wealthiest person suggested he would not seek to politicise Twitter. 'For Twitter to deserve public trust it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally,' he tweeted yesterday evening. In earlier comments, Musk has been outspoken about his desire to promote free speech on Twitter, saying that he is 'against censorship that goes far beyond the law'. 'If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect,' Musk added. 'Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.' His statements have been interpreted as criticism of Twitter's existing moderation policies, particularly those that have affected the US right. The former president Donald Trump was banned from the social network in 2021 for his role in encouraging the storming of the US Capitol, while Greene had her personal account permanently suspended after breaking the platform's five-strike rule. But Musk has argued that his changes would affect all users. 'Attacks are coming thick and fast, primarily from the left, which is no surprise,' he said, in a reply to the rightwing media personality Ben Shapiro. 'However, I should be clear that the right will probably be a little unhappy too. My goal is to maximise area under the curve of total human happiness, which means the ~80% of people in the middle.' The response to the acquisition is not equally distributed, however. Katy Perry, the pop star who is the site's third biggest user, lost 7,000 followers in a few days, while Obama, whose 132 million followers make the former US president's account the most popular on the site, lost 5,000 on Tuesday alone. Followers of the former first lady Michelle Obama are down by nearly 20,000. Cruz, the junior senator for Texas, added more than 60,000 followers, while Greene gained more than 100,000 followers in the last week, a tenfold increase in the normal rate. Followers of Johnson are up by nearly 10,000, but the Twitter account of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has lost just over 1,000 followers. Some speculated that the changes were the result of action from Twitter 'cleaning house' in preparation for the acquisition, but the social network said they were the result of 'organic' activity. 'While we continue to take action on accounts that violate our spam policy which can affect follower counts, these fluctuations appear to largely be a result of an increase in new account creation and deactivation,' a spokesperson said. Much of Musk's criticism for Twitter's moderation practices has been focused on a single employee, Vijaya Gadde, the company's chief legal officer. His tweets sparked tens of thousands of abusive messages targeted at the executive, and a public rebuke from a former Twitter chief executive, Dick Costolo. 'What's going on?' Costolo tweeted at Musk. 'You're making an executive at the company you just bought the target of harassment and threats.' 'Bullying is not leadership,' he added later, to which Musk replied, 'What are talking about? I'm just saying Twitter needs to be politically neutral.' The social media platform admitted in its first quarter results on Thursday that it had overstated its user numbers by nearly 2 million between the first quarter of 2019 and the last quarter of 2021. Twitter said the miscount in monetisable daily active users was down to an error in a feature that allowed people to link multiple separate accounts together to conveniently switch between them.  The company had 229 million daily users in the first quarter of the year, up from 214.7 million in the previous three months. The rise was slightly higher than analysts had expected. In what may be one of its final earnings reports as a public company, Twitter also announced its revenue rose to $1.2bn in the first quarter, up from $1.04bn a year earlier but slightly lower than forecasted. On Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission, is looking into whether Musk complied with an antitrust reporting requirement when he bought his stake in the Twitter earlier this month, Reuters reported, citing the Information. The inquiry is attempting to determine if Musk bought the stake to influence Twitter's management or if he looked to be a passive shareholder.", "e2401492d52d868495a0777199d6a89a35b425c69831dc4b8ea682ef": "They smell like sweet meat, destroy vacuum cleaners and are wreaking havoc across rural New Zealand. An unusually wet summer has brought joy to farmers and grief to residents, as a plague of cluster flies descends on homes in the Canterbury and Wairarapa regions. Cluster flies - which are larger, more sluggish and smellier than a common housefly - pose no risk to human health but can come as an unwelcome surprise to those whose houses they cluster in. One homeowner in Masterton told Stuff that it was the worst season for cluster flies in her 20 years living in the area, and that she needed to run multiple vacuum cleaners in multiple rooms twice a day just to clear the onslaught. 'At times it was so disheartening when you vacuum in the morning and by the evening they are back again,' said Lisa Urbani. 'You feel like you're fighting a losing battle. Once or twice I felt quite depressed about it all. I thought 'Oh my God, will it ever end?'' The infestation has meant good business for pest control workers, who have been swamped with requests for help. Daniel Highman   of Guaranteed Pest Control in north Canterbury has been working from dawn until dusk for weeks, and has needed to rope in his partner to keep up with demand. 'My alarm clock is basically my phone ringing in the mornings with clients in need of cluster eradication,' he said. 'It's been absolutely crazy.' Highman has never seen cluster flies in such numbers since starting in the industry six years ago. 'Reports I've had from farmers who have farmed in the district for longer than I've been alive say they have never seen them this bad ever,' he said. A bug expert warned that scenes like those might become more common as climate change gave insects longer breeding seasons. 'Insects like it when it's warm and they also like it when it's moist,' said entomologist Dr Paul Craddock. 'When you're seeing longer, warmer summer months, that means numbers may build up in certain years, and start coming into contact with people.' Patricia Hilton of Allpest Pest Management in Central Otago said she couldn't help but be impressed by the flying critters after a decade of working with them. 'They're so clever. They're so sneaky,' she said. 'They hang out in summer time just doing their fly thing. Then when it cools down they come inside and give off a sweet, meaty smelling pheromone, so they [other flies] know it's somewhere safe to hibernate for the winter. 'In the springtime, they leave the building and mate, laying their eggs in the soil. Then they hatch and hang out and have a lovely summer, and it all happens again.'", "50f2eb0c4b226eeec40a88fe3f26978644dc0cede5c64d059bce7334": "Time to wrap up... here's today's main stories: Goodnight, and best wishes for the bank holiday weekend if you're in the UK (and not working...).

Quite a contrast with New York, where the Dow Jones is now down 1.7% or 575 points at 33,340. David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital, says European shares pushed higher despite tensions around Russia have ticked up.  The pound is on track for its worst month against the US dollar in six years, amid worries that a recession could be looming. With only a few hours trading to go, sterling has lost 5.7 cents against the US dollar since the start of April to around $1.256, the biggest monthly drop since October 2016. The euro has had an equally grim month, down five cents to around $1.05, its biggest fall since 2015. The dollar has benefitted from expectations of sharp rises in US interest rates this year, as the Federal Reserve tries to rein in inflation, and hit a 20-year high agains a basket of currencies this week. As Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: The possibility of an end to Russian energy exports to Europe is also hitting confidence, he adds: The eurozone is heading towards a contraction as the cost of living squeeze and the Ukraine war hit the economy, warns BNP Paribas's Markets 360 team.

Russia's central bank chief has said the danger of an inflationary spiral have decreased, as she explained today's rate cut. Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said inflationary pressure stabilised in the second half of March, and pointed to stabilizing inflation expectations and improving savings sentiment among households. Nabiullina said (via Interfax): US consumer sentiment picked up in April. As anxiety over the economic outlook eased -- even as the economy went into reverse -- according to the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index. It rose to 65.2 for April, up from 59.4 in March. but still below 88.3 in April 2021. Most of the surge was concentrated in expectations, with gains of 21.6% in the year-ahead outlook for the economy and an 18.3% jump in personal financial expectations.  Richard Curtin, surveys of consumers chief economist, says confidence is still weak, though: Wall Street has dipped in early trading, as Amazon's shares slide after it reported its first loss since 2015. Amazon have fallen almost 12% to $2,547, their lowest since June 2020, after it reported a net loss of $3.8bn in the quarter.  It was dragged into the red by a fall in the value of its stake in electric vehicle maker Rivian. But revenue growth slowed to just 7%, Amazon's slowest growth rate in nearly two decades. Craig Erlam of OANDA says Amazon was the latest to catch Wall Street off guard, as it faced a multitude of challenges -- including the Ukraine war, the cost of living squeeze, and the end of lockdown restrictions. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down 1.3%, as is the broader S&P 500, with Amazon leading the fallers. The risk of Russia defaulting on its sovereign debt may be easing today, after Moscow made a number of already-overdue international debt payments in dollars. Moscow has said that dollar payments on two foreign bonds are progressing after sanctions held them up for weeks.  It has previously used roubles to cover the payments after US restrictions prevented them being made in dollars. Missing the dollar payments breached the terms on the debt, starting a 30-day grace period that ends next week. Russia's finance ministry said it had managed to pay $564.8m on a 2022 Eurobond and $84.4m on a 2042 bond in dollars - the currency specified on the bonds. The ministry said it had channeled the required funds to the London branch of Citibank, one of the so-called paying agents of the bonds whose job is to disburse them to the investors that originally lent the money to Moscow. We now wait to see if the money reaches the bond holders before the 30-day grace period expires on 4th May..... Britain's cost of living crisis, and the ongoing problems in the global supply chain, continue to hammer AO World, the online electricals retailer. AO, which sells kitchen appliances, computers, TVs and gaming consoles over the web, warned that its profits will dive this year as it faces falling sales. AO had previously been hit by global supply chain issues and a shortage of drivers. Now, customers are cancelling warranties on its products to save money amid the cost of living crisis, as my colleague Sarah Butler explains: Shares in AO have slumped 20% to 70p, a two-year low, having soared over $4 in January 2021 as the pandemic drove a boom in web shopping.

Berenberg Bank explains: My colleague Richard Partington says warning lights are flashing in the eurozone economy today, after France stalled and Italy shrunk in the last quarter. Here's the full story: Over in the US, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of consumer inflation has just hit a 40-year high. The PCE prices index rose by 6.6% in the year to March, the highest reading since 1982, with energy prices up 33.9% and food up 9.2% In March alone, the PCE rose by 0.9% in March, up from 0.5% in February. Despite rising prices, Americans kept spending last month. Consumer spending grew 1.1%, faster than expected, meaning real spending was up 0.1% after inflation Personal income rose 0.5% in March, as wages increased (but still lagged inflation), while the savings rate dipped to 6.2% from 6.8%. Deutsche Bank has been under pressure from authorities in recent years to improve its areas such as money-laundering controls, ahead of today's searches. Back in 2018, Germany's financial watchdog, Bafin, ordered Deutsche to do more to prevent money-laundering and 'terrorist financing,' and appointed KPMG as an independent auditor to assess progress. Three years later, Bafin ordered Deutsche to bring in tighter controls, and expanded KPMG's mandate. In 2020, Frankfurt Prosecutor's Office fined Deutsche Bank EUR13.5m for being slow to report suspected money laundering in more than 600 cases related to its work with Danske Bank, but dropped a money-laundering probe against Deutsche Bank managers. Seperately, in Janary 2021, Deutsche agreed to pay US authorities around $130m and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve allegations that it breached bribery and fraud laws. Last month, Deutsche admitted it had breached this DPA by failing to flag a whistleblower complaint over its environment, social and governance work - meaning the DoJ has extended its monitorship. Today's may add to a list of legal and regulatory issues looming over Deutsche Bank's CEO Christian Sewing, says Bloomberg: Prosecutors, federal police and other officials are conducting a search at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, the city's prosecutors have said. Germany's largest lender said the search involved suspicious transactions it had itself reported in relation to money laundering, and that it was cooperating fully. Reuters has the details:  Deutsche Bank's shares are down around 2%. Russia's economy is expected to contract by between 8% and 10% this year, the Bank of Russia warns. The decrease will be mainly driven by 'supply-side factors', it says -- namely the sanction imposed on Russia since the war began. That would be the worst drop since Russia's economy shrank for several years in the early 1990s, exceeding the 7.8% decline after the 2008 financial crisis. Anouncing today's rate cut, the Bank says the economy has already begun to decline It predicts that the Russian economy will begin growing gradually in 2023, amid a structural transformation: Russia's central bank says that inflation in Russia could be as high as 23% this year, a sign of the economic damage caused by sanctions imposed since the Ukraine war: Announcing today's interest rate cut, it says: Inflation is then seen at 5.0-7.0% in 2023, before returning to the Bank of Russia's 4% target in 2024.  Russia's central bank has lowered interest rates to 14%, a bigger cut than expected. At its regular meeting, the Bank of Russia lowered its key rate by 300 basis points to 14% from 17%.  Economists had expected a smaller cut to 15%, but this still leaves borrowing costs much higher than before the Ukraine war. Announcing the move, the Bank of Russia says that inflationary pressures have eased after the rouble recovered from its plunge when the Ukraine invasion began in February: In February, Russia's central bank more than doubled interest rates from 9.5% to 20% shortly after the war began, in an attempt to support the sliding rouble.  Russia's currency has since recovered to levels before the invasion, at around 70 to the US dollar, having hit a record high of 135 to the rouble in March.

Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), will accuse the government of an 'absolute failure of political leadership', which is leading to a breakdown in trust among young people. In a damning speech to the NAHT's annual conference on Friday, Whiteman will say that the prime minister's behaviour over Partygate is 'unforgivable', and that the government's failings are making it harder for schools to produce well-rounded young people who are ready to fulfil their role in society. 'The basics taught in school are not how to write and how to count,' Whiteman will tell delegates. 'The first things are self-regulation, good behaviour, decency, honesty and integrity. Things that are hard to observe in the UK government right now.'I am not that angry that we all obeyed the rules at the most desperate of times while our leaders partied,' he will tell NAHT members, who are gathering in Telford this weekend. 'In the grand scheme of things, the offence of having a glass of wine and a slice of cake is minor. 'But for the prime minister of the country to mislead us about it, repeatedly, is unforgivable, and clearly in breach of the standards of our democratic institutions,' Whiteman will say. 'If we cannot trust our leaders to tell the truth about cake, how can we trust that we will be told the truth about war? How can we trust that we will be told the truth about refugees, how can we trust that we will be told the truth about the economy, the progress of the pandemic ... or the government's ambitions for education? 'It matters because young people can see this playing out before their very eyes. And schools' efforts to make sure young people understand the basics of self-regulation, good behaviour, decency, honesty and integrity become so much more difficult against that backdrop.' Whiteman is also expected to attack the government's record on refugees and to reject recent ministerial interference over political impartiality and how schools discuss these issues with their pupils. 'Like the rest of us, young people see on the television every day the appalling scenes from Ukraine. And before that, the difficult scenes from Afghanistan and the difficult scenes from Syria. 'They see refugees, desperate humans, arriving on our shores in rubber boats from France. And they also see the complete lack of compassion, the complete lack of humanity demonstrated by our government in the way we deal with these issues. Young people are not stupid.'

Alongside this we are delivering on our manifesto commitment to raise teachers starting salaries to PS30,000.'", "30801b239d38decb2f99b9017a74edb2d98dc5eafbe576badeb91f37": "From sociable labradors to aggressive pitbulls, when it comes to canine behaviour there are no end of stereotypes. But research suggests such traits may have less to do with breed than previously thought. Modern dog breeds began to emerge in the Victorian era and are often physically distinct - for example, great danes are huge and chihuahuas tiny. But it has often been thought breed can predict behaviour, too. Now researchers say there's little sign that's the case. Dr Elinor Karlsson of the University of Massachusetts Umass Chan medical school, a co-author of the study, said research revealed a huge diversity of behaviours within each breed. 'Even if the average is different, you've still got a really good chance of getting a dog that doesn't match what people say that breed is supposed to be,' she said. Writing in the journal Science, the US researchers report how they analysed survey responses relating to the physical traits and behaviour of 18,385 pet dogs, almost half of which were purebred, with genetic data analysed for 2,155 of them.  Analysis of the survey results for purebred dogs suggested about 9% of behavioural variation was explained by breed. 'For the most part, we didn't see strong differences in breeds, but there are some [behaviours] that are connected to breed more than others,' said Karlsson. While no behaviour was exclusive to one breed, howling was more common among beagles, while pitbulls and retrievers were more 'human sociable', or comfortable with strangers. There were also some differences based on dogs' ancestral functions. For example, herding breeds were, among other traits, more biddable. But there was a high degree of variability between individuals, meaning it is difficult to predict a dog's behaviour based on its breed. To explore whether genetics explained the associations, the team analysed the behaviour of mutts that had different levels of ancestry from particular breeds. The results reveal some traits have a stronger genetic component than others. Labrador retriever ancestry was associated with mutts who had few qualms about getting wet, yet such ancestry appeared to have no link to human sociability. 'We'd expect that if Labrador retrievers are genetically more human social, we should see that mutts with more Labrador retriever ancestry to be more human social,' said Karlsson.  While the team's other analyses found human sociability is highly heritable, Karlsson noted the mutt results suggest the genetic variants involved do not appear to be more common in particular breeds. Instead, differences between breeds for this trait may be down to environmental influences, or even owners' perceptions. But not all behaviours were found to be heritable, including how easily a dog is provoked by a frightening trigger - a finding that suggests that how aggressive a dog is may have little to do with genetics. The team says the study has implications for owners. 'They should pay much less attention to all the stories about what their dog's breed ancestry says about their behaviour and personality, and pay attention to the dog sitting in front of them,' said Karlsson. Daniel Mills, professor of veterinary behavioural medicine at the University of Lincoln, who was not involved in the work, said genetics can give insights into populations but often reveal far less about individuals. Mills added that it was not surprising genetics played little role in canine aggression, and criticised breed-specific legislation. 'Potentially risky behaviours ... are unlikely to be controlled by simple genetic mechanisms since animals have to make judgment calls based on the much wider environment and their developmental history,' he said. The findings came as another study, published in Scientific Reports, revealed that different breeds have strikingly different life expectancies. The analysis of 30,563 records of dog deaths in the UK, collected between 2016 and 2020, showed that while jack russell terriers have a life expectancy of 12.72 years at birth, flat-faced breeds tended to have shorter lives, with French bulldogs having a life expectancy at birth of just 4.53 years. Such brachycephalic dogs are known to be prone to myriad health problems as a result of their extreme physical traits. Justine Shotton, president of the British Veterinary Association, said the findings of lower life expectancy for flat-faced breeds was concerning: 'While the study doesn't prove a direct link between these breeds' potential welfare issues and shorter length of life, the findings serve as a fresh reminder for prospective dog owners to choose a breed based on health, not looks.'", "d9c52b31e8a058f8f6ef228b0c96edbb37eef84dd2c48f1c91fd10f8": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol is expected to issue letters requesting voluntary cooperation from House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and around a dozen other Republican members of Congress, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The panel intends to issue a letter to McCarthy - the top House Republican - and is considering further letters to Scott Perry, Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Mo Brooks, Lauren Boebert, Andy Biggs, as well as some Republican senators, the sources said. Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chair of the select committee, is expected to authorize the list of Republican members of Congress caught up in the investigation potentially as soon as this week. The letters may come either this week or next week, the sources said. The scope and subjects of the letters are not yet finalized, and the sources cautioned that the members of Congress approached for cooperation may still change. On Thursday, Thompson said only that he would send letters to McCarthy and other Republicans. But the select committee's move to seek cooperation from some of Donald Trump's fiercest defenders on Capitol Hill - and for some members like McCarthy, Jordan and Perry, the second such request - marks a new gear for the inquiry as it reaches its final stages. The new letters are being discussed internally as a final chance for cooperation before the select committee considers ways to compel their assistance, the sources said: once reluctant to pursue subpoenas against members of Congress, the mood on panel is changing. The panel has a renewed interest in McCarthy's cooperation after new reporting this week showed he had told the Republican leadership days after January 6 that Trump admitted to him at least partial responsibility for the Capitol attack, the sources said. The select committee is particularly focused on whether Trump might have indicated to McCarthy why he believed he was culpable for the Capitol attack, the sources said, and whether the former president knew he may have acted unlawfully on January 6. Thompson is also considering letters to Greene and Perry and other Republicans who played an outsize role in the effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election and pressed the White House about Trump declaring martial law to stay in office, the sources said. The select committee wants to learn more information from members of Congress who were in constant text-messages communication with Trump's former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, described by one of the sources as 'those in the text message traffic'. A spokesman for the select committee declined to comment. Greene messaged Meadows on 17 January, according to one of more than 2,000 texts Meadows turned over to the investigation and obtained by CNN, that some members of Congress were calling for Trump to impose martial law to remain in power. 'In our private chat with only Members several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call Marshall [sic] law,' Greene said in the text. 'I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next.' Meadows did not appear to respond to Greene's text. But the messages Trump's top White House aide was receiving shows the extraordinary ideas swirling around Trump after he and his operatives were unable to stop the certification of Biden's election win on January 6. The newly-released text messages also show Perry, now the chairman of the ultra-conservative House freedom caucus, lobbying Meadows to replace the justice department leadership with Jeffrey Clark, a DoJ official sympathetic to Trump's effort to undo the 2020 election. Greene and Clark were among the leading Republicans determined to overturn Trump's defeat to Biden, according to the text messages - as well as testimony provided to House investigators by Cassidy Hutchinson, a Trump White House aide who worked for Meadows. The select committee appears to believe the time is right to request voluntary cooperation from the members, the sources said, capitalizing on the public outrage surrounding McCarthy's remarks and the texts sent by the Republican members of Congress. Thompson on Thursday confirmed to reporters that he would certainly issue a second letter to McCarthy to appear before House investigators, as well as to Jordan and Perry, but declined to name other targets or how he would proceed if the requests were rejected.", "859a4d9ab67b66ed7e459e34fdb5cab6d1cb63be3ff17a068ef85987": "A large kangaroo has kicked a woman to the ground and repeatedly stomped on her in an unprovoked attack on a Gold Coast golf course. The 69-year-old woman was playing golf at the Arundel Hills Country Club when the animal struck from the side without warning just after 9am on Friday, Queensland ambulance said. 'She's fallen to the ground at that first kick, and then when she's been on the ground, she's been stomped [on] a number of times by the kangaroo,' ambulance service operations supervisor Joel McEwan said. 'She was walking down the fairway, and the kangaroo's come from the side, and just attacked without warning.' The kangaroo then suddenly stopped its attack and moved away, leaving the woman lying on the ground with significant cuts to her face, head, arms and legs. The woman was still conscious and moved into a golf buggy after the attack, with paramedics arriving not long after. 'The patient was quite upset at the scene ... obviously it's a shock being attacked by quite a large kangaroo,' McEwan said. The woman was taken to Pindara private hospital in a stable condition, where she was being treated for her injuries. McEwan said the most serious cut is to her jaw and she may require stitches. The Queensland ambulance service has dealt with kangaroo attacks on humans previously on the Gold Coast, but McEwan said this was the first in about 12 to 18 months. 'They're not common, especially on the golf courses where they get quite a lot of kangaroos,' he said.", "a9db408c15e1d137d80b3b7e7066ca857bfda98877583eeaa1eda810": "A 77-year-old white South African farm owner has appeared in court after shooting and wounding a black woman he claimed he mistook for a hippopotamus. Paul Hendrik van Zyl, was arrested on Tuesday after 'firing shots in the direction of the woman', Ramokone Linah, who was fishing with her partner in a river in Lephalale town, northern Limpopo province. Van Zyl faces attempted murder charges, according to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). 'The arrested suspect alleged that he was shooting at the animals' police spokesperson, Mamphaswa Seabi, said in a statement. Linah, 38, sustained gun shot wounds on her arm, while her partner 'managed to hide' before informing police and emergency services, police said. The accused 'is the owner of the farm where the incident occurred', said Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, NPA spokesperson in the province. Police seized two rifles, one revolver, one pistol, and two airguns during the arrest. Deep racial divisions remain in South Africa 28 years after the end of white minority apartheid rule, and such incidents frequently cause outrage. According to one local media report, the victim was part of a group of local men and women who had been fishing in a river near Mamojela Park, an informal settlement outside the mining town of Lephalale, since mid-morning. The shooting occurred in the early afternoon. Witnesses said van Zyl had fired at the group from the other riverbank and had been heard to tell police that he had aimed at what he thought were 'hippos and monkeys'. A group of opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) supporters staged a protest about the granting of bail outside the court, according to the party's posts on Twitter. Hendrik was freed on 1,000 rand ($62) bail and the case was postponed for further investigations to 18 May. In a country where firearms are common, fatal accidents occur often, with about 250 people killed in 2018. According to 2019-2020 police crime statistics, more than 7,000 murders with guns were reported in South Africa. In a similar incident five years ago, a South African farmer was accused of wounding a farm worker with a pellet gun after 'mistaking him for a monkey'. The incident also took place in Limpopo province.", "315edfcb33d9dc182e11fca8a00d45c6e24c614dfa9604c486614c0e": "A vast blanket of foul-smelling toxic foam has overflowed a polluted river near the Colombian capital Bogota, covering homes and businesses, and sending residents fleeing from cloud-like fragments as they drift through the streets. 'The smell is terrible - [and] we've had to put up with this foam for a long time,' community leader Luz Mariela Gomez told local television channels. 'We're running a risk. Someone could fall down there and we won't be able to find them.' Photographs from the residential suburb Mosquera showed immense drifts of pungent foam burying pavements and towering over residents. One road to a school was blocked. Local environmental authorities said that the polluted foam - which has been seen in the town several times over the past few years - is increasing because of people dumping waste, chemicals and detergents into the river system. Heavy rains have added to the problem. The Mosquera mayor's office tweeted photos of the toxic foam, alongside town officials. The mayor, Gian Gerometta, claimed that the buildup of pollution was partly due to a blockage caused by plants in the river. 'We are aware of the risks that can arise due to this phenomenon,' he tweeted . Authorities also warned locals against getting too close to the foam, which is thought to cause respiratory problems and skin irritations. 'It is important that children are kept away as we do not yet totally know what this material is,' Edwin Garcia, a government environmental official, told local radio station Caracol, adding that a treatment plant in the region has been working to decontaminate the river since 2020. 'We will be monitoring and cleaning the entire river to prevent foam from continuing to accumulate.'", "574c124831c9e52c62dd18e15a009e2e4797cc8d54f685ec7e8412dd": "The Sun attempted to expose Jimmy Savile as a paedophile while he was still alive, only to have to back down because of Britain's tough libel laws, according to one of the journalists who investigated the case. Meirion Jones said the tabloid was ready to publish the story in 2008, which could have brought the entertainer to justice. The newspaper's reporters had signed affidavits from women who had been abused as children by Savile at the notorious Haut de la Garenne children's home in Jersey. In an article for the Guardian, Jones said the Sun's journalists and editors had confidence in the evidence that Savile had abused individuals on the island. However, the tabloid's lawyers were worried they would lose any subsequent libel case and be left with a PS1m bill, partly because the victims might not be believed in court. Jones said the newspaper knew Savile was highly litigious and if they published a story they 'would be facing the best QCs money could buy, representing a man who could potentially call Prince Charles, Margaret Thatcher, the heads of charities, the head of the BBC and the pope as character witnesses.' The journalist, who features in a recent Netflix documentary about Savile, said: 'The best guess of the lawyers was that a libel action could cost PS1m and the Sun would definitely lose. The story was canned and the journalists and editors were furious. But this wasn't the first or last time that Savile escaped because of our libel laws, which rewarded his deliberate targeting of vulnerable victims.' Instead, the Sun published a carefully worded article about child abuse at the Jersey care home, along with a picture of Savile on the premises - while repeatedly emphasising that the BBC presenter had no knowledge of what happened there. Despite this, Savile's lawyers still threatened legal action. A copy of a letter sent to the Sun in 2008, seen by the Guardian, was written on behalf of the presenter by Fox Hayes Solicitors, a Leeds business that is now defunct. Emphasising the 'huge sums' that Savile's charity work had raised for children, the lawyers demanded the Sun issue a prominent statement 'making clear that any visit to the home was entirely innocent', delete the article from its website, and pay Savile compensation 'for the injury to his feelings and reputation'. The legal firm said child abuse was the 'antithesis of everything he [Savile] has worked tirelessly to prevent'. They insisted the entertainer did not remember visiting children at the care home in the 1970s and that 'any such visit would have been unexceptional save for the pleasure it may have given'. After Savile's death in 2011, hundreds of his victims came forward. The public eventually learned that one of Britain's most famous light entertainment stars was also one of the country's most prolific paedophiles. Jones, now editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, helped to tell the victims' stories, but only after BBC bosses blocked his initial investigation from appearing on Newsnight, in one of the corporation's worst scandals. He is now urging the government to reform Britain's libel laws to make it easier for investigative stories to be published, warning they have been used by people ranging from Savile to major corporations and Russian oligarchs to avoid scrutiny. The justice secretary, Dominic Raab, is currently overseeing a review of the relevant legislation.

It stood in the middle of a traffic island, near a bin, a lamp-post and a bollard. I never questioned the presence of the phone box, just as I never questioned the presence of the bin, the lamp-post or the bollard. Often, when we passed, my daughter and I would play the phone-box game. I had to stand to one side and pretend to call the phone in the phone box, which didn't work. She would then pretend to answer, before making a series of further calls in a complicated unfolding of phone-related business that involved making plans, changing plans and then ringing everyone she had just spoken to again to tell them she was going to be late. It was fun, this game, and it became hard to pass the phone box without playing it. The phone box, to her, was the best kind of toy. It was a real object that no longer worked, and therefore had the gravitas of something adults had once used, but could now be deployed to her own imaginative ends. It also had an extra, loopy charm. A giant phone housed in its own little shelter outside in the middle of the street made absolutely no sense. A phone, to her, was a small, shiny rectangle that lived in my coat pocket. This outdoor cubicle with a handset on a cord and fat, squishy buttons was both hilarious and mysterious, as if it had landed from the sky. Walk round a city, a town, a village and you see them. The last phone boxes. Once you start seeing them, you see them everywhere. For a while, I became preoccupied by their contradictory presence, often standing proudly on a street corner, completely ignored. At their peak, in the mid-1990s, the British population of phone boxes was about 100,000. Now, there are just over 20,000 working boxes left, which still sounds like quite a lot, given it's hard to imagine anyone actually using one. And yet, they do. According to Ofcom, 5m calls are still made from phone boxes annually. Five million! It seems impossible. A number so surprisingly large it made me think there must be a lone guy in a box somewhere obsessively making one-minute calls all day to random numbers. Many of the phone boxes you still see are shells of their former selves: not working, not yet gone. Just there, a remnant of a former time, often used as a bin. Some have been repurposed. Since 2008, when BT launched its adopt-a-kiosk scheme, more than 7,000 phone boxes, mostly the old red ones, have been bought by local communities for PS1 each. Now, they house things such as mini libraries, art galleries and plant displays; many contain defibrillators, for ready access in a medical emergency. Those that remain occupy a particular place in Britain's idea of itself. On Oxford Street, I passed a tourist shop whose window display included a shelf of miniature red phone boxes sitting alongside its close relations: the doubledecker bus, the black taxi and an old-fashioned post box, all symbolic of a storybook, Enid Blyton-ish Britain. 'If you were to do a painting of an English village,' said Nigel Linge, professor of telecommunications at Salford University and probably Britain's premier phone-box expert, 'you'd have a duck pond, a church, a pub and I'd bet you'd have a phone box.' (Linge's first phone-box memory: calling relatives from the one on his estate in the mining village of Willington, County Durham; his family didn't get a phone in the house until the 1980s.) 'I don't think any other country is as passionate about their phone boxes as we are about ours,' he added. To understand this unlikely passion, I started going into every phone box I passed. Typically, there was broken glass, discarded cider cans, an unmistakable smell of piss. Not much to love. One old red box in Camden was a wreck - no door, plastic bottles and browned leaves carpeting the floor, a handwritten note in the glass advertising a hot blonde. I picked up the receiver and heard, unbelievably, the long tone of a line open for calls. An old, old sound. And then, a memory dump from a mid-1990s adolescence. Back then, out with friends, I used phone boxes quite a lot. They were near bus stops, outside tube stations. The odd reverse-charge call in a mishap, begging lifts or forgiveness. Now, the phone box is an object caught between existence and obsolescence. They seem pointless, and yet they endure, on our streets and in our culture, covered in creepers in the music video for Adele's song Hello; clambered all over by One Direction for the cover of their 2012 album Take Me Home; being stroked by Molly-Mae Hague, in beige shorts and waistcoat, for a recent Pretty Little Thing campaign. ('A lot of youngsters seem to want to be photographed near one,' noted Linge.) Thousands of people apparently still use them. I wanted to know who they were and why, when technology had long ago surpassed what a phone box could offer, they were still heaving open their weirdly heavy doors and making a call. People, remembering them in their prime, often talk about the smell. Cigarettes and cleaning fluid. A metallic odour on your fingers from the buttons. Once, there were phone directories on a shelf, then sex-worker cards wallpapering the door. In the early days, until the last manual switchboard closed in 1976, you spoke to an operator and told her - it was always her - what number you wanted to call. Often, there were queues. 'You'd have to walk round the corner shop and wait your turn,' said Martin White, owner of a company, X2 Connect, which repairs and resells old phone boxes that BT has removed. I visited White at his offices on an industrial estate in Newark, Nottinghamshire. His business has an inevitable limit, given the dwindling numbers of boxes. 'Another thousand or so will do,' White told me. 'Then that will be the end of that.' Surely White would know who was making all those calls. But no. He'd last used one 'six years ago?' His kids, aged 38 and 36, had never been inside one, as far as he knew. To one side of White's office was an open space that had been turned into a kind of phone-box purgatory, crammed with battered boxes awaiting their new life. Once refurbished, White sells them on to all sorts. Old people's homes to jog the memory of residents; private clients who fancy a bit of heritage in the garden; nostalgics embarking on a quest, like the old man who wanted to buy the box from which he'd called his wife when they were teenagers. They get plenty of overseas buyers, too, who want their own bit of British kitsch. White had recently shipped one off to a shopping mall in Dubai. In their weathered state, you could just about pick out a potted history of the British phone box. White didn't have the earliest standard model, the cream K1 (Kiosk One), which appeared in 1921, after the General Post Office had taken over the operation of phone boxes in 1912. (The link was logical: the Post Office and phone boxes were both a public good in the business of connecting people.) But there were plenty of the most common of the old red boxes, the K6, designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and introduced in 1935, in celebration of King George V's Silver Jubilee. (It was embossed with the Tudor crown.) And there were more than anyone could hope for of the unlovable 1980s version, dull grey and black with a boxy, flat-topped shape that abandoned all of the blazing-red, domed-roof chutzpah of the earlier version. No Dubai shopping mall was coming for those. Even in their heyday, phone boxes were problematic. 'They've never made money,' said Linge. The boxes - free to enter and full of cash - were like invitations to vandalism. But they were always heavily used. When BT became independent of the Post Office in 1981, and was then privatised in 1984, the company kept increasing the population of boxes until the 1990s. It was only when mobiles became ubiquitous in the early 2000s that BT began culling their numbers. The boxes, many now unused, were a cost whatever their state: the working ones needed maintenance, the broken ones required removal. In the year to April 2020, the company's net loss on its provision was PS4.5m. But even if it wanted to, BT can't just scrap them all. The company is under a 'universal service obligation' to provide phone boxes, regulated by Ofcom, which, as its director of connectivity Selina Chadha told me, has to ensure that 'everyone in the country can communicate'. BT can only remove a phone box if it has the approval of Ofcom and the local authority, and the box isn't in a location with no mobile signal, where there are frequent traffic accidents, if more than 52 calls have been made from the box in the past year, or if there are 'exceptional circumstances' such as the phone box being frequently used to call helplines. BT is therefore left in a bind, required to maintain thousands of phone boxes that dent its profits. James Browne, BT's 'head of street', assured me that it 'takes its responsibility to provide street-based telephony very seriously' and as such, the company has come up with a new ruse, the Street Hub 2.0 - a tall, flat screen wedged into the pavement offering rolling advertising space and, if you look closely enough, free wifi and calling facilities. (A small percentage of the ad space is given freely to councils and local businesses.) 'Yes, it's a commercial endeavour,' said Browne, cheerfully. Redundant as they seem, there are times when phone boxes prove essential. After Storm Arwen last November, which left thousands of people in the north of England and Scotland without power and mobile service, Chadha told me she had received reports from communities wishing they still had their phone box. According to Ofcom, from May 2019 to May 2020, 150,000 calls were made from phone boxes to emergency services. And then there are the other emergencies: the 25,000 phone box calls made to ChildLine that year; the 20,000 calls to Samaritans. Calls made by people who can't make them at home or on a mobile, for reasons too private or painful to know. The phone box in Seathwaite, in the valley of Borrowdale in the Lake District, is probably the most remote in England. It sits at the edge of a farmyard, next to a path that leads to Scafell, the country's highest mountain. Last August, a man made a 999 call from the box after his 13-year-old son fell and injured his leg on their way to the 140ft waterfall at Taylor Gill Force. The boy couldn't walk. The emergency operator alerted the Keswick mountain rescue team, who sent out nine volunteers to stretcher him off the mountain. Recently, when I stopped to pay my respects to the box that had so recently been of active service - one of the 5m calls! - I picked up the phone and heard the reassuring hum of the dial tone, surely a beautiful sound if you've just stumbled down a path leaving your child up there in pain. According to Freda Chapman, who has lived in Borrowdale all her life, BT had been trying to remove the area's four phone boxes for years. 'Each time we get consulted, and each time we have objected to their removal,' she told me. In one consultation in 2016, BT revealed that 378 calls had been made from the Seathwaite box in a year. 'Only one a day,' conceded Freda, 'but that is still one a day.' BT also suggested the Borrowdale villages - Rosthwaite, Seathwaite, Seatoller and Stonethwaite - adopt their phone boxes for community use, flowers or books, which as Chapman put it, 'is a nice thing to do if you don't need the phone box any more. But we said we'd rather have the phone box, actually.' Borrowdale's phone boxes vary. Rosthwaite's is the 1980s version, as is Seathwaite's, while the ones in Seatoller and Stonethwaite are the classic reds, objects whose decorative crowns and distinctive shape, modelled on Sir John Soane's family vault in St Pancras churchyard, are located in such arresting settings, backed by dry stone walls and rising dark hills, that any photograph of them looks like the kind of stock shot you find in a picture frame. Pretty as the villages might be, up there on the mountains, conditions can be rough. Walkers fall all the time. The Keswick mountain rescue team performed 126 rescues last year. Rob Grange, one of the team, told me that even if you're able to scramble down for help, half of the few cottages in the valley are holiday rentals and dark for most of the year. 'You come down off the fell,' said Grange, with a faraway look that suggested sleet and adversity, 'and there's nobody there.' When BT issued its 2016 consultation about the Seathwaite phone box, the Keswick team posted the news on Facebook and overnight prompted hundreds of complaints to Allerdale borough council. The Seathwaite box was saved, but in plenty of other villages in the Lakes there were boxes with blue BT posters tacked up next to the phone warning that the company was planning to remove it. In Chapel Stile, all that was left was a freshly tarmacked square where it had once stood, like an unmarked grave. Three hundred miles south of the Lakes, on a parade of shops in North Wembley, resides the Borrowdale quartet's perfect opposite: four unused and unloved boxes. 'Not the pretty red ones,' said local councillor Mary Daly, regretfully. Three of them are the 1980s boxes, each in varying states of disrepair. One is more contemporary, installed about five years ago, and the only one that works. 'I've never seen anyone use it,' said Katherine Cunneen, a local resident. 'Never.' As hard as the residents of Borrowdale campaign to keep their phone boxes, Cunneen is fighting to have the defunct boxes taken away. Cunneen has lived in North Wembley for nearly 50 years. When she moved to the neighbourhood from a local authority flat in Paddington, 'everyone said, 'You're so lucky''. She had a house, there was a Marks & Spencer, three cinemas. Over the decades, she told me, the good shops have left, replaced by endless takeaways. Rubbish is left on the streets. The housing stock has become run down. The phone boxes, she felt, were symbolic of the neighbourhood's decline. On a recent grey afternoon, she took me from one grotty specimen to another, the kind of boxes where no one wants to start a community library or pose in beige shorts. One had what looked like green algae spreading up its walls; another seemed to have been whitewashed on the inside, as if to obscure criminal activity taking place within, or just its regular use as a toilet. 'Would you see these in Richmond?' said Cunneen, pointing at a particularly bleak kiosk by the tube station. That one, she said, was mostly used by people straight off the train: she had seen a man walk out of it just the other day, zipping up his fly.  Phone boxes have always been an obvious location for a variety of crimes, being both easily accessible and oddly private. There was a stabbing in one in Bolton in February. In Littlehampton a few years ago, a sex offender used to regularly call a phone box to target passing schoolchildren. In Nottingham, some boxes outside the Bridgeway shopping centre had to be removed after it was reported in 2018 that more than 3,000 calls were being made from them a year, mostly by drug dealers. (At the time, a BT spokesman valiantly suggested the source of all the calls 'could well be tourists', but as a local resident countered, 'I don't think we tend to see an awful lot of tourists in the Bridgeway Centre to be quite honest.') In North Wembley, Cunneen took up the situation with her local councillor, Daly, who tried to raise the issue at the council, and convince BT to take them away. But there they remain. Ultimately, it was BT's choice to remove them or not. 'I don't accept that,' said Cunneen. 'They're on the pavement. They might own the structure, but they don't own the pavement.' Britain's most attractive phone boxes, meanwhile, have become such beloved and valuable commodities that they now get stolen. Last summer, there were reports of phone box theft from the villages of Chelford in Cheshire and Holtwood in Dorset. 'I drove past one day, and it had gone,' said Josh Pritchard, the manager of Holtwood Farm, a day centre for adults with learning difficulties. No one in the village could make sense of it. The box, next to the Methodist church, was about to be taken over by Pritchard's farm and turned into a mini library. It's not easy to steal a phone box. They have power cables that run into the ground and are locked in place on a concrete base. A thief would need a lorry-mounted crane to yank it out of the earth and drive it away. They must have come at night, said Celia Moore, chair of Holt parish council, who sounded both mystified and mournful at the loss. 'It was just always there,' she said. 'It's a bit disappointing for the community,' added Pritchard. 'There's a church, a post box and a phone box. That was it.' That painting of the village, now missing its most colourful feature. The parish council informed the police, who didn't seem particularly moved by their case. Phone-box theft is not an urgent crime. Still, the villagers wondered why someone would bother. 'Obviously there's a market out there for them,' said Pritchard, 'so someone decided to make a few quid.' The phone box market has several dimensions. There is the BT-approved market in the form of companies that sell them on, and the eBay market where you can buy a box with mysterious provenance for PS3,000, and then there's another kind of market in the form of a company called RKC Estates, run by Eddie Ottewell, who around a decade ago bought a load of old red boxes from BT for PS1 each through a charitable venture called Thinking Outside The Box, and then appeared to change tack and started auctioning business leases for the boxes online. (Ottewell did not respond to a request for an interview.) According to Mat Harris, who knows Ottewell and runs the site that auctions his boxes, Ottewell bought up listed boxes in good locations - Brighton, Greenwich, Hampton Court, Hampstead - where his clients knew that their business selling coffee or sandwiches, or whatever else they could flog from a tiny box, would have plenty of passing traffic. In Hampstead alone, Harris estimated RKC Estates owned five or six boxes, which, according to RKC's website, are rented out for PS400 a month after an initial fee of somewhere between PS1,500 and PS4,200. A couple of well-positioned boxes near Brighton pier were put up for sale for PS10,000 each. The one in Greenwich, meanwhile, Ottewell was apparently keen to hold on to, 'unless he gets a really silly price'. 'His 100 quid investment is worth PS1m now,' added Harris, confirming the final stage of the phone box's peculiar arc, from public service via privatised anachronism through patriotic iconography to profit-making commodity. All that from a box. But the question still burned. Who, who, was making all those calls? I spent so long lurking suspiciously around phone boxes, hoping, always hoping, that I might catch someone in the act. In the end, the only call I witnessed was the one I made myself, to the payphones hotline - a small team in a call centre in Wales - to report on the decrepit state of the Camden phone box in which I was standing. The only time I even saw someone else step inside one was when I happened to spot some engineers working at an electrical cabinet next to a box. One went in, lifted the phone and shouted in amazement: 'It works!' I'd listened to plenty of nostalgic stories, though. Like Martin White, ringing his future wife. Or Freda Chapman's mother, whose only way of getting a message to her husband while he was at work was by popping down to the village box. Or Andrew Hurley, the phone-box curator whose mother would go to the local kiosk every Sunday night at 8pm to talk to his father while he was fighting in the second world war. The most devoted phone-box user I heard about, however, was Eric Dewhurst of Bretherton, Lancashire. Dewhurst lived alone, opposite an old red box which he used as his personal phone. Most days, he'd take his bag of 20ps across the road and install himself for his daily calls, often to his older brother, Bill, or to his nieces, Carole and Elaine. They once bought him a mobile phone, but he refused to touch it. 'He didn't like change,' Elaine told me. (They tried to give him a duvet once, but he preferred to stick with having 'hundreds of blankets' on his bed.) If it was wet and cold, Dewhurst would be in there wearing boots and several coats, including a mackintosh tied up with twine. People would call him in the box, too. Everyone in the village knew it as Eric's phone, so if someone passing heard it ring, they'd answer, then pop across the road to his bungalow and tell him he was wanted. When Dewhurst died in 2019, the phone box in Bretherton stopped being used - it was a one-man box - but the village decided to fill it with books and keep it in his memory. His name won't mean much to a newcomer, but any Bretherton longtimer can picture Eric out there in all weathers, bulky in his coats, a bag of silver in one hand, chatting. I wondered what Eric would have made of the new Street Hub 2.0. No shelter from the rain in one of those. You can't get in it at all. I found a few newly installed around the corner from the old Camden box, all giving off a low hum from an internal fan. Close up, I realised they simply resembled giant smartphones - a black rectangle with a massive screen, with a keypad and ports for your charger and headphones. It was hard to imagine someone standing there, all plugged in, casually ringing a mate. But then I remembered the father in the Seathwaite box, all those emergency services calls, the calls to ChildLine and Samaritans, the people after Storm Arwen who wished they still had their phone box, all the other Eric Dewhursts who must be out there, living alone, suspicious of mobiles. As Selina Chadha put it, 'Some payphones are a lifeline.' When all else has failed, a rope thrown into the water connects one troubled hand to another. A cable from a phone box links voice to voice. Human connection can be an act of rescue in itself. I started to think that Ofcom, in its touching insistence that a private company continues to provide the population of a country the chance to make a call from a box on the street, was on to something. As we look at a future where storms descend with greater frequency, where energy sources are compromised or unaffordable, where power is no longer something we can assume we will always have in our homes - perhaps Ofcom knew just how essential phone boxes may still be. At the end of my wayward quest, I decided that if I couldn't see someone make a call from a phone box, I could at least hear one ring. They must have rung so often, once. All those queues; a time slot long arranged for a parent to call a child who'd moved to the city; lovers waiting to hear each other's voices. I texted my mother. Call me on this number! I'm in a phone box! She didn't reply, probably busy. I waited for 10 minutes until the awkwardness of standing in a phone box doing nothing became overwhelming. I texted her again and told her not to worry - the combination of technology and communication once again proving itself to be an imperfect work in progress. To scratch the itch, I ended up ringing the phone box from my mobile, and there it was, the tinny little sound of potential connection, drifting into the street.

But on Monday I met her in person for the first time. We were meeting just days after prosecutors announced they were dropping criminal charges against her, cancelling a scheduled court appearance where she was set to find out if they would retry her case. Even so, Moses insisted that she take me to visit the hulking criminal courthouse in downtown Memphis, a building simply known by its address, 201 Poplar. We went through security and walked downstairs into one of the courthouse's main waiting areas, where electronic screens on the wall showed defendant names and where they stood on court dockets for the day. It was mostly empty, but on a normal day, Moses said, it's crowded with Black people waiting to get their cases heard. She walked past a line of people waiting at a clerk's office and asked a teller if a judge she knew was still around - he wasn't. We took the elevator up to the seventh floor, which houses the courtroom where Moses' case took place. When the doors opened, a sheriff's deputy beamed, gave her a hug, and congratulated her on beating the case. 'This man tried to kill me the first time he met me,' Moses said, laughing. She would later tell me he was one of the officers who took her into custody when the bail in her voting case was abruptly revoked in December. Now, she said, they were cool with each other. Back downstairs we ran into Kenneth Brashier, a lawyer Moses has known for a long time. He was beaming too and congratulated her. 'Usually you have a cigar when you take a victory lap,' he told her. Moses said she'd take a victory lap once she changed Tennessee's law around felon disenfranchisement. It was raining, so Moses and I spent the rest of the day driving around Memphis in her car. Waiting to pick up her son Taj from school, we talked about the case of Crystal Mason, the Texas woman appealing a five-year prison sentence for casting a provisional ballot while ineligible in 2016. Moses was stunned to learn Mason's vote wasn't even counted. She walked me through several of the criminal and other legal cases she's been involved in, rattling off an encyclopedic knowledge of judges, lawyers, and other county officials. She's outspoken and embraces her reputation as a bit of a troublemaker. 'I'm like Rocky Balboa,' she said at one point with a laugh. When I asked her what would come next for her now that the voting case was over, she didn't miss a beat. 'I'm working on getting a man of out of prison who's been there for 25 years,' she said. In her yard, she still has a sign up from her long shot 2019 mayoral campaign. It was that effort that prompted election officials to start investigating her voting eligibility. Earlier that morning, Moses had held a press conference at the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine motel, where Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated. It was the first time Moses had spoken about her case since the charges were dropped. Taj, 13, a tech whiz, helped set up two iPhones to stream the press conference. 'I am so lucky to be here with my mom because I am blessed. Other children are not as fortunate as me to have their parents released and have their charges dropped,' he said. Moses said Tennessee should get rid of the form that people with felonies have to fill out if they want to vote, the document at the center of her case. Tennessee has one of the most confusing and harshest felon disenfranchisement policies in the country - more than 450,000 people, including more than 20% of the Black voting age population, can't vote because of a felony conviction, according to an estimate by the Sentencing Project. She told me she saw her case as an effort to intimidate Black voters. 'When it comes to Black people in the south, whatever we do, if it's wrong, you've got to pay for it,' she said. 'If there was a white person and I got treated the way I did, I would be just as upset, but you don't see white people getting treated like that.' Moses also rebuked Amy Weirich, the district attorney who prosecuted the case. Weirich put out a statement on Friday suggesting Moses bore responsibility for her long sentence because she did not take a plea deal. Moses said the statement showed how the prosecutor was determined to get a conviction: 'It showed who she is: arrogant, wants to be right. I think it just sounded like she wanted to win.' A Weirich spokesman declined an interview request. Moses urged people to vote in the Democratic primary for district attorney, which is going on right now (two of the candidates, Linda Harris and Janika White, watched from the audience). Afterwards, during a lunch at a barbecue restaurant across the street, Moses encouraged other Tennessee voters to talk to Harris. At the press conference that morning, she mentioned that she had considered committing suicide while she was in jail last year. Later she told me it was connected to the shock of being abruptly taken into custody. 'Going to jail is not a bad thing for somebody who's been before. It's a bad thing when you're not expecting it,' she said. Snacking on a steady stream of Jolly Ranchers from her front cupholder as we drove around that afternoon, she pointed out what she sees as deep inequalities in Memphis. Near Graceland, we drove by what looked like a busy voting precinct. People vote there, she said, because there's money and tourism. Further down the road, Moses pointed out the neighborhood had changed: many of the buildings were abandoned, a consequence, she said, of white flight. 'There's so many things wrong in Memphis,' Moses said. 'How dare you waste our tax dollars, waste our time, waste our manpower, how dare you do that? That's what most people can agree on.'", "363faadfcdf936cb8e8a4189711d5a20b0b32c5e769d1efaa6fcbac6": "On a spring morning three years ago, a new recruit to a loyalist Syrian militia was handed a laptop belonging to one of Bashar al-Assad's most feared security wings. He opened the screen and curiously clicked on a video file, a brave move given the consequences if anyone had caught him prying. The footage was unsteady at first, before it closed in on a freshly dug pit in the ground between the bullet-pocked shells of two buildings. An intelligence officer he knew was knelt near the hole's edge in military fatigues and a fishing hat, brandishing an assault rifle and barking orders. The rookie militiaman froze in horror as the scene unfolded: a blindfolded man was led by the elbow and told to run towards the giant hole that he did not know lay in front of him. Nor did he anticipate the thud of bullets into his flailing body as he tumbled on to a pile of dead men beneath him. One by one, more unsuspecting detainees followed; some were told they were running from a nearby sniper, others were mocked and abused in their last moments of life. Many seemed to believe their killers were somehow leading them to safety. When the killing was done, at least 41 men lay dead in the mass grave in the Damascus suburb of Tadamon, a battlefront at the time in the conflict between the Syrian leader and insurrectionists lined up against him. Alongside piled heaps of dirt that would soon be used to finish the job, the killers poured fuel on the remains and ignited them, laughing as they literally covered up a war crime just several miles from Syria's seat of power. The video was date-stamped 16 April 2013. A paralysing nausea took hold of the recruit, who instantly decided the footage needed to be seen elsewhere. That decision has led him, three years later, on a perilous journey from one of the darkest moments of Syria's recent history to the relative safety of Europe. It has also united him with a pair of academics who have spent years trying to get him - the prime source in an extraordinary investigation - to safety while identifying the man who directed the massacre and persuading him to admit his role. It is the story of a war crime, captured in real time, by one of the Syrian regime's most notorious enforcers, branch 227 of the country's military intelligence service that also details the painstaking efforts to turn the tables on its perpetrators - including how two researchers in Amsterdam duped one of the most infamous security officers in Syria through an online alter ego and seduced him into spilling the sinister secrets of Assad's war. Their work has cast an unprecedented light on crimes previously believed to have been widely committed by the regime at the height of the Syrian war but always denied or blamed on rebel groups and jihadists.  Nine years later, as war rages in Ukraine, a playbook of state terror on civilian populations rehearsed in Syria is being redeployed by Russian forces, as Vladimir Putin's so-called special military operation turns into a brutal occupation of parts of the east of the country. Military intelligence units there have been at the forefront of savagery, instilling fear into communities through mass detentions and killings of the type that characterised Assad's brutal attempts to claw back power. Trained by Soviet and Stasi officers in the 1960s, Syria's security agencies learned well the art of intimidation. Often, the allegiance of those snatched at checkpoints was of little consequence; fear was the regime's most lethal means to cling to power and it used every means available to instil it. In this case, the victims were not insurrectionists but civilians who were unaligned to either side and had accepted Assad's protection. Their murders were widely seen in Tadamon as a message to the whole suburb: 'Don't even consider opposing us.' In leaking the video, first to an opposition activist in France, and then to the researchers, Annsar Shahhoud and Prof Ugur Umit Ungor, from the University of Amsterdam's Holocaust and Genocide Center, the source had to overcome the fear of being caught and probably killed and the distress of potentially being cast out from his family - prominent members of Assad's Alawite sect, which holds the main levers of power in what remains of Syria. He would eventually learn that even as hundreds of people around the world worked to bring Assad to justice for war crimes, the video would end up being a standout piece of evidence in the case against the Syrian leader. But first, Annsar and Ugur needed to find the man in the fishing hat, and they turned to the only thing they believed could help: an alter ego. Annsar had been a vocal critic of Assad since the outbreak of the Syrian war. Her family were members of a community that had largely retained good relations with Assad, but the conflict and the ensuing economic collapse strained alliances and Annsar increasingly found herself determined to hold Assad to account, no matter the personal price. She moved to Beirut in 2013 and then to Amsterdam two years later, where she met Ugur in 2016. Both shared a drive to chronicle what they believed to be a genocide being committed in Syria. Piecing together the stories of survivors and their families was one way to do it. Speaking to the perpetrators themselves was another. Breaking the omerta code of the regime, however, was a task thought nearly impossible. But Annsar had a plan: she decided to turn to the internet, and find her way into the inner sanctum of the regime's security officials by pretending to be a fangirl who had fully embraced their cause. 'The problem was that the Assad regime is very difficult to study. You don't just walk into Damascus, waving your arms, saying well, 'Hey, I'm a sociologist from Amsterdam and I would like to ask some questions,'' said Ugur, in the grand dark wood drawing room of the Holocaust and Genocide Centre. 'We came to the conclusion that, actually, we need a character - and that character should be a young Alawite woman.' Annsar established that Syria's spies and military officers tended to use Facebook, and despite their secretive work lives, they tended not to make their social media settings private. She decided on an alias, 'Anna Sh', and asked a photographer friend to shoot an alluring glimpse of her face. She then turned her homepage into a glowing tribute to Assad and his family and set about trying to recruit friends. Day and night for the next two years, she scoured Facebook looking for likely suspects. When she found a taker, she told them she was a researcher studying the Syrian regime for her thesis. Eventually, she got good at it. She learned the regime mood of the time and, together with Ugur, tailored jokes and talking points that might help with an approach. Soon, Anna Sh became known among the security services as an understanding figure - and even a shoulder to cry on. 'They needed to talk to someone, they needed to share their experience,' she said. 'We shared some stories with them. We listened to all the stories, not focusing only on their crimes.' 'Some of these people got attached to Anna,' Ugur continued. 'And some of them started calling in the middle of the night.' Over the next two years, Annsar lived and breathed her new persona. At times she recoiled from who she had become - someone who had got into the minds of her prey and could at times understand them on a raw human level that eclipsed the clinical boundaries of her research. But the snap back to reality was usually sudden. Many of those she had spoken to had been active parts of a killing machine, others were willing parts of the cabal that enabled them. Her health took a toll, as did her social life and her sanity. The prize was worth it, however. If she could find the gunman in the video, she could start to bring justice to the families of those he killed. And, maybe, she could start what few others had managed in the decade-long conflict: begin a process that irrefutably linked the Syrian state to some of the war's worst atrocities. In March 2021, the breakthrough finally arrived. Anna Sh's Facebook following had by then won the confidence of more than 500 of the regime's most devoted officials. Among her trawls of their friends and photos, a distinctive moon face with a scar and facial hair stood out. He called himself Amgd Youssuf, and he looked very much like the gunman in the fishing hat that she had exhausted herself looking for. Soon afterwards, Annsar, or Anna Sh - by now it had become difficult to distinguish the two - received corroboration from a source inside Tadamon that the killer was a major in branch 227 of the Syrian military intelligence service. 'The relief was indescribable,' she said. 'Here was someone who held the key to it all. And now I needed to make him talk.' Annsar remembers well the moment she hit send on her friend request, and the excitement she felt when her prey accepted. After all this time, the bait had been set. Now she needed to reel him in. The first call was fleeting; Amjad was suspicious and ended the call quickly. But something in that initial conversation had whetted his curiosity. The hunter had become the hunted. Was it the thrill of talking to a strange woman, the need to interrogate someone who dared to approach him, or something else? Either way, when Amjad video-called three months later, Annsar pressed record, and 'Anna' answered the call. After all these years, there he was; stern at first, very much in character as a spy who controlled all his conversations and readily deployed stony silence as a weapon. He uttered few words, and when he did speak he mumbled, forcing his listener to strain to hear him. Anna Sh did all she could to disarm Amjad, grinning sheepishly, giggling and deferring to him as he peppered her with questions, all delivered on his terms. Gradually his frozen face begins to relax, and Anna won the floor. She asked him about Tadamon. And then she asked a question that changed the tone of the whole conversation: 'What it was like to go hungry, not to sleep, to fight, to kill - to fear for your parents, for your people. It's a huge responsibility - you carried a lot on your shoulders.' Amjad sat back in his chair, as if to acknowledge that somebody had finally understood his burden. From then on, he was in the interrogation seat. The conversation was no longer his. Anna had an answer for every one of his replies; building him up, putting him at ease and puffing his ego. Much like Jennifer Melfi was to Tony Soprano, she had become to him a therapist, a sounding board, a trusted woman that could get to know his mind without, it would seem, passing judgment. 'I don't deny that I was excited talking to him,' said Annsar. 'So I was smiling. Because wow, you're talking to him. But to know their stories, we need to convince them that we are just researchers. So they open up. It's not a result of one interview - it's a result of four years undercover. Gradually, I learned to dissociate myself. I created this girl who is really admiring their deeds. It's tough. After you close the laptop, you feel like it's heavy stuff, but it's needed. And I wanted to see him as a human.' Throughout the summer of last year, Annsar and her alter ego, with Ugur often sitting just off screen, tried to persuade Amjad to talk. Getting inside the head of a killer was one thing, but gathering real information about why he did and extracting admissions was another. They trawled his Facebook profile for clues, and came across a photo of a younger brother, and poems Amjad had written after his death in early 2013, three months before the Tadamon massacre. Anna kept pestering him for another call, but he remained elusive. Then late one night in June, her Facebook messenger lit up. It was Amjad. Here was her chance to nail him down. Amjad was more relaxed this time, dressed in a singlet with perhaps a drink or two on board. The floor was now his, or so he thought, and he began with small talk, trying to feel Anna out. She seized her moment and asked about his brother, and the feared killer and enforcer started to weep. Anna switched to Melfi mode as he told her he had to stay in the military despite the risk of his mother being forced to grieve another son. 'You did what you needed to do,' he said. And then came Amjad's first real admission. 'I killed a lot,' he said. 'I took revenge.' As if to recognise the gravity of the moment, Amjad shut down the conversation and ended the call. Over the next few months he was difficult to find, responding only on chats and asking when Anna was returning to Syria. Who was this woman who had gotten under his skin? When would he get the chance to interrogate her on his own turf and terms? Amjad started to play the role of the jealous boyfriend, asking who Anna was with, whether she drank and where she was. Annsar, meanwhile, was starting to feel that her alter ego had reached the limit of her powers, and that Anna Sh needed a rest, just as she did. The character had spoken to up to 200 regime officials, some of them direct perpetrators in murders, and others part of a community that had aided and abetted Assad's increasingly brutal attempts to cling on to power. They had started to speak among themselves about the mystery woman in all of their inboxes. Late last year, after Annsar had spoken to a woman who accused Amjad of assaulting her, she had had enough. All this empathising with perpetrators had started to seep into her soul. So, too, was living a character. 'Annsar also deserves to live,' she said. 'And then the question was, where is Annsar? Who is Annsar now? Lost in the research? Anna was able to pretend in life and as an Alawite, pretend for hours here in Amsterdam. And I think Anna went so far, it's not only a digital identity. Where is the original person in all of this? Where is Annsar? So I decided to execute Anna.' On a cold morning in January this year, Ugur and Annsar packed a small box with a printout of Anna's Facebook profile, a sword used as a symbol by the Assad regime and some trinkets and drove to a nature reserve outside Amsterdam. There, they dug a hole and buried the character, with a startled dog walker the only other person to bear witness to the demise of a digital sleuth whose body of work would have made any real spy proud. 'I mean psychologists and therapists will tell you that if you have a particularly difficult period, you can mark that period with a ritual,' said Ugur. 'So ritualising something actually helps you put it behind you. I thought, actually, good riddance.' It was time for the two researchers to start focusing on the material they had collected and had not been able to process while so deeply immersed in the character they had just buried in a forest with a minute's silence 'I laugh about her all the time,' reflected Annsar. 'We always remember Anna.' But there was one more thing they needed to do; confront Amjad with what they knew about him. 'Because how long do you want to go on courting a mukhabarat [intelligence] officer,' asked Ugur. 'I think that the moment where he opened up about his brother, and that he committed revenge, that's as close as you can get in this particular context.' Over Facebook messenger, Anssar, using her real identity this time rather than 'Anna', sent Amjad a 14 second sequence of video. 'His first question was: 'Is that me in the video?' I said: 'Yes it's you.' He said: 'Yeah, it's me. But what does this video tell? Nothing. I'm arresting someone, and that's my job.'' Realising the consequences of what he had just been shown, Amjad then railed against members of the National Defence Front, the militia that the rookie who had leaked the video had belonged to. He described them as thugs and killers and said he was not like them. Then the subterfuge stopped, and Amjad defiantly embraced what he had done. 'I'm proud of what I did', he wrote in a message, before threatening to kill her and her family. Neither Annsar nor Ugur have responded to Amjad since February and have blocked him from their social media accounts. However, he has tried to reach out several times. He is clearly nervous about what lies ahead, as well he may be. War crimes prosecutions in Germany have started to break the armour of impunity that has shrouded the Assad regime in Syria. Yet those court hearings do not contain the same overwhelming evidence as depicted in the Tadamon massacre video. Before this story could be told, however, one man needed to get to safety - the person who had leaked the video to a friend in France, and then to Ugur and Annsar. Some time in the last six months, he started his dangerous journey. Leaving the regime in Syria is never easy. Anyone hoping to travel to other parts of the county, or especially abroad, faces a long process of questioning before being allowed to do so. Although Assad retains power, the area he controls has shrunk, and two powerful overlords, Iran and Russia, have veto over many state decisions. Opposition groups retain control of the north-west, and the Kurds have aegis in the north-east. Syria remains broken and unreconciled; a place where even family members can be suspected of being traitors in waiting. And that is how it was when a young man set off from the Syrian capital for Aleppo in the past six months on the first leg of a journey that would take him to the opposition-held north, then to Turkey and onwards to Europe. The drive to Aleppo was a nervous one. He had been allowed to leave, but would the dreaded intelligence units catch up with him before he made it beyond their clutches? On Aleppo's northern outskirts, a colonel from the 4th division of the Syrian army pocketed a $1,500 (PS1,187) bribe in return for allowing the man across the no man's land separating both sides. The journey was delayed a day, as a Captagon shipment was readied by the 4th division to cross the same route. Shortly after, a truck carrying dozens of kilos of the stimulant, made and distributed by the regime and exported across the Middle East, made its way to the opposition-held north. The source soon followed. Several weeks later, Annsar met him in Turkey, where gaps in the story of Tadamon were filled in over weeks of discussions, and notes for a war crimes prosecution steadily put in order. In February, Ugur and Annsar handed over the videos and their notes, comprising thousands of hours of interviews, to prosecutors in the Netherlands, Germany and France. In the same month in Germany, came the first ever prosecution of another Syrian military intelligence official, Anwar Raslan, for his role in overseeing the murder of at least 27 prisoners and torture of at least 4,000 others. He was convicted of crimes against humanity and has been imprisoned for life. Annsar remains estranged from her family and in her words, is not the same person she was before she started this project. 'But it was worth it,' she said. 'It was exhausting, but I hope our work will help bring justice.' Tadamon these days is a bustling part of the capital that looks like war never darkened its doorsteps. Much of the damage and the atrocities have been covered over by buildings, carparks, or piles of the flotsam and jetsam of conflict. Annsar and Ugur remain convinced that many more massacres took place there and have been piecing together locations and the names of those who went missing in the savage tussle for control of the suburb. 'The locals blame the regime,' said Ugur. 'They know who killed their loved ones. The strange thing is that the people who were killed in this video were not dissidents, they were onside with the regime. You can see they are not malnourished. They are straight from checkpoints, not dungeons. They were killed as a warning not to consider crossing sides. Their families deserve justice.' The source, meanwhile, is safe outside Syria. In fleeing his surroundings - the innermost circle of the Assad regime - he has condemned himself to a life of exile. 'He is happy with his decision,' said Annsar. 'Sometimes people just want to do the right thing. If I've learned anything out of this, it's that there's good in people. That truth can still eventually see the light.'", "9062bea59c7036fce8e70e2c94f1bc0cdb7baece8fc19c3a40c820bb": "Jose Moreno and Katerin Huertas have walked and hitchhiked hundreds of miles. Moreno, 20, wears beach sandals and carries a backpack stuffed with baby clothes, nappies and oat milk. Huertas, 22, carries their seven-month-old son, Kylean, strapped to her chest. They cross a knee-deep river and scramble up a muddy slope in the sweltering heat. But the worst of their journey is yet to come. Ahead of them lies one of the most dangerous border crossings in the world: the Darien Gap, a lawless, roadless region of mountainous jungle, venomous snakes, fast-flowing rivers and murderous drug traffickers that connects South and Central America. According to official data from the Panama government shared with the Guardian, more than 13,000 people illegally crossed from Colombia into Panama via the Darien Gap in the first three months of 2022: nearly triple the number during the same period last year. About 133,000 people made the journey in 2021 - the highest on record for any year by far. The latest figures have alarmed human rights organisations and UN officials, who fear numbers will continue to rise. They warn that the combination of wars and conflict, the climate crisis and the fallout from the Covid pandemic is sending a constant flow of tens of thousands of desperate, vulnerable people from around the world through the Darien Gap - which only a few hundred migrants a year would have braved a decade ago. 'There is serious concern that the numbers could go up very significantly,' says Michele Klein Solomon, regional director for the UN's International Organization for Migration. 'We don't see this abating.' Many of the migrants are robbed, raped and murdered by traffickers and armed groups. Women sometimes give birth along the way. About a quarter of those making the journey are children, most of them under five.  'There's no such thing as a safe route through the Darien,' says Klein Solomon. At least 51 people died trying to cross the region in 2021, she says, adding: 'We know that's a very significant underestimate.' The Guardian accompanied migrants as they set out from Capurgana - a small beach town popular with Colombian tourists on the south-eastern edge of the Darien, accessible only by air or sea - into the jungle. So far this year, about a third are from crisis-torn Venezuela, with nearly as many from Haiti. Others come from as far as Senegal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Bangladesh, Uzbekistan and China. Most are groups of young men, or families with children. Moreno and Huertas are part of a group of about 20 people heading north, 'for a better future for our children', says Moreno. 'Getting to the United States, American soil - the American dream.' The situation back home in Venezuela is 'terrible', he adds. 'Crime is rising, the cost of food is rising, and salaries aren't going up.' He worked for nine months selling fruit on the street in Chile and Peru.  Not far behind the Venezuelans on the trail is a group of seven people - including three children aged between one and three - from Haiti. Shiller Rebi, 50, and Herold Louis, 41, spent three years working on construction sites in Santa Catarina, Brazil, to raise enough money for the trek north with their families. 'Haiti is in many crises,' says Rebi. 'Economic crisis, a presidential crisis ... We don't have work, we can't earn money to eat, to pay for school.' They hope to reach Mexico and then, maybe, the United States. Also making the journey are two families from Angola. Nine months earlier, Simao Vieira had fled from the African country, and his job at a telecoms company, after he was attacked during an inter-ethnic conflict. 'They were going to kill me,' he says. In Brazil, he had life-saving surgery. But his family experienced racism and struggled to make a living. Vieira, his wife, Ruth and their daughter, Jacira, 12, are now bound for 'any country that receives us and treats us well'. Back in Capurgana, taxi drivers shuttle migrants to a camp on the outskirts of town as soon as they step off the boat. 'We want to help them,' says Carlos Ballesteros, president of a local civic group. The rudimentary compound of breeze blocks will soon include a campsite, a kitchen and a shop, ready to cater to 1,000 people daily. 'Everyone's earning a little bit of cash,' he says. Here, migrants are told what to expect in the jungle - and encouraged to travel light. 'In the jungle you will get to know the dark side of everyone. You have a dream, but you are not obliged to go,' one local organiser tells a subdued group of Venezuelans, including Moreno and Huertas. Then they are left to haggle with some of the 180 local people working as porters and self-described 'guides', who charge as much as $120 (PS95) for each person. The Venezuelans insist they can only scrape together 400,000 Colombian pesos (PS80) in total, but convince someone to take them as far as the border with Panama. There, they will be handed over to indigenous Guna guides. 'I'm not doing harm to anyone,' says Herman Colina, a farmer in rubber boots with a machete at his hip who has grudgingly agreed to accompany the group. He had himself fled poverty and violence elsewhere in Colombia - four of his brothers were killed by guerrillas, he says. According to Colina, the route has become more organised, safer and quicker, in contrast to chaotic scenes last year, when tens of thousands of migrants were camped in nearby towns. It now takes four or five days, down from more than a week. Colina claims that he has rescued migrants with broken bones and dispatched them to faraway hospitals free of charge. But UN officials and local rights organisation workers say that such activities amount to human trafficking - and that guides often extort, sexually assault and abandon their clients. Katiara Mesa, an official in the mayor's office in Capurgana, says they have received no reports of such abuses - but concedes that migrants have no way of raising the alarm. An alternative route by sea to Panama also carries deadly risks. In October, three people died and at least six disappeared - including three children - after an overloaded boat sank while carrying about 30 people from Haiti, Venezuela and Cuba. Several of them were buried in an overgrown corner of the local cemetery. Those that make it to Panama still face a journey of 2,000 miles across half a dozen borders to reach the US. In March, US authorities arrested 210,000 people at the border - the highest monthly total in 20 years. Half of those were deported. The US should make it much easier for refugees and temporary workers to get visas in their home countries, say experts. 'You shouldn't have to make it all the way to the US to claim asylum. It's insane, and only benefits the smugglers,' says Adam Isacson, of the Washington Office on Latin America (Wola), a US human rights organisation. Panama also bears responsibility for the lawlessness of the Darien, says Isacson. 'It's 60 miles of trail. Why is there not a single policeman there? You can't leave people unprotected for that long.' Klein Solomon says Panama and other host countries such as Brazil, Colombia and Chile need more international funding to receive and integrate migrants. 'They haven't got the resources,' she says. None of the many dangers - or the risk of deportation at their destination - deter the group of Venezuelans from the journey. 'We hope all this effort isn't in vain,' says Huertas, hoisting her backpack again and checking on her baby. 'To have the opportunity to get ahead, to work, to give the kids a good future. That's the most important thing, right?'", "e0eb9b0359f9fc3728d0ead837c4e5204a6e8e62056ed897651cd995": "", "afd2ef29b41b4b267ae5467ced52694aa17ebc13db4707dae4e6cb91": "Charles McCrory is haunted by a memory from his 1985 trial in which he was accused of murdering his wife, Julie Bonds, in a bloody attack at their home in Andalusia, a small town in deepest Alabama. What haunts him is the look on the jurors' faces as they listened to the testimony of the prosecution's star witness, a dentist named Richard Souviron. He was a founding father of a cutting-edge branch of forensic science known as bite-mark analysis, which claimed to be able to identify violent criminals by matching their unique dental patterns to the bite wounds on victims' bodies. McCrory was expecting Souviron's evidence to be nuanced. In his initial report, the dentist had been cautious about what could be deduced from two puncture marks found on the upper right arm of Julie's body, saying that the injuries were insufficiently distinct to allow a positive match with the perpetrator. But that was not what he told the jury. When Souviron was asked whether the two marks were teeth marks, he said: 'Yes.' Then the prosecutor asked him: 'In your expert opinion, based on the evidence presented to you, were these teeth marks made by Charles McCrory?' 'Yes,' the dentist replied. McCrory remembers vividly the sinking feeling he experienced in that moment, given the glaring contrast between Souviron's initial report and what he was now saying in court. 'I was in disbelief at his testimony being so different,' he recalled. 'I knew it was extremely damaging to our case. You could see it in the eyes of the jurors.' McCrory shared his recollections of that critical instant in a handwritten letter he sent to the Guardian earlier this month. It was composed from an Alabama prison cell where he is serving a life sentence, still protesting his innocence, 37 years after the jury returned a guilty verdict based on that one simple word: 'Yes.' McCrory's current lawyer is Chris Fabricant. Together with co-counsel Mark Loudon-Brown, Fabricant is representing the prisoner in an epic battle to clear his name almost four decades after he was identified as the source of those supposed teeth marks on his wife's body. For Fabricant, this is much more than a routine criminal case. It is the latest chapter in a personal voyage that began 10 years ago, when he embarked on his exploration of the murky waters of forensic science. Fabricant is director of strategic litigation at the Innocence Project, the formidable New York-based non-profit that for 30 years has used DNA evidence to overturn hundreds of wrongful convictions. He is an authority on the perils and limitations of science as it has been applied to criminal justice. In that role, he has become one of forensic science's most piercing critics. He has highlighted the part played by 'expert witnesses' - forensic dentists, ballistics experts, FBI laboratory agents, lie detector examiners, blood stain investigators  - in inadvertently putting innocent people behind bars. He has a word for it: junk science. In his new book, Junk Science and the American Criminal Justice System, Fabricant explains what he means by the term. 'Junk science sounds like science,' he writes, 'but there is no empirical base for the 'expert opinion'; it is subjective speculation masquerading as science.' The world of junk science took off in the late 1960s and 70s - an era in which confidence about the ability of scientists to propel humanity to giddy new heights was unbound. If science could put a man on the moon, then surely it could do the much more mundane job of nailing violent criminals? Fabricant told the Guardian that there were problems with the new forensic science techniques from their inception. The methods did not arise out of the usual scientific method that starts with a problem, develops an hypothesis to solve it, then tests it via empirical methods. Rather, it turned the formula on its head. Start with a desired solution - banging up criminals - then work back to the science that would support it. 'Most of the new theories emerged not from a scientific laboratory but from a crime scene,' Fabricant explained. 'An enterprising investigator would think, 'Maybe I could match this suspect's teeth to the bite on this victim's nose - that would prove the suspect is the murderer'. Then off they'd go and find an expert witness who could back the theory up.' The explosion in junk science began with forensic pathologists who, with the enthusiastic encouragement of the FBI's legendary crime laboratory, began to invent a plethora of new forensic practices. The new generation of techniques had this in common: they all claimed to be able to identify an individual perpetrator through forensic analysis of various types of crime scene evidence. There was 'hair microscopy' - the idea that a single hair retrieved from the scene of a murder could be put under the microscope and matched with high degrees of certainty to the suspect's hair. There were lie detector tests sold under the portentous title 'polygraphs'; voice spectrometry to identify a criminal through forensic deconstruction of their speech; 'toolmark' analysis that sought to link marks found at a crime scene to a specific object - a pipe, perhaps, or hammer; and comparative bullet lead analysis that professed to be able to match a bullet found at the scene of a killing to the single box of bullets from which it originated. As use of the new techniques began to spread across the US, the reputation of forensic pathologists soared. They were invited to attend specialist conferences around the world, and lauded as 'medical detectives'. Celebrity status wasn't far behind. One of the earliest stars of the genre, New York's medical examiner Dr Milton Helpern, was called 'Sherlock Holmes with a microscope'. His successor, Dr Michael Baden, was given his own HBO TV series in the 1970s. Autopsy showcased a new forensic technique each week, highlighting the wonders they performed in solving gruesome and knotty crimes. Baden later went on to be involved in high-profile cases such as the OJ Simpson trial and the autopsy of Michael Brown, the unarmed Black teenager shot dead by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Following the rise of such celebrities, it was but a step to forensic science becoming infused into the popular imagination. TV shows that had lionized vice cops and FBI special agents now began to switch their soft-focus lenses on to forensic pathologists. Forensic Files aired from 1996 to 2005. CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, a formidably popular show aired between 2000 and 2015, looked at how forensic scientists cracked the hardest criminal cases. Once this glowing view of forensics had taken hold of the small screen, it was inevitable that it would seep into the mindset of juries. 'These TV shows depict an unrealistic infallibility of forensic sciences which became part of our popular culture,' Fabricant said. 'Jurors walk into court believing that if it is forensic science that ties this defendant to the crime, then the likelihood of their guilt is overwhelming.' With forensic pathologists soaking up so much glamorous TV coverage, it was only a matter of time before dentists wanted in on the game. By the late 1970s, as Fabricant chronicles in his book, 'forensic odontology' was starting to emerge, pioneered by a small number of individuals who were portrayed as 'swashbuckling crime fighters, handsome, fit, bawdy, prone to ghoulish humor, comfortable with dead bodies, brilliant. Men's men.' Fabricant quotes the Los Angeles Times remarking admiringly that one of those pioneers, Dr Gerald Vale, hadn't fixed a tooth in years. 'His job is to fill jail cells, not cavities,' the paper gushed. An industry newsletter said about Vale: 'Instead of tracking down decay, he tracks down people!' What united the group of 12 'founding fathers' of forensic odontology was the belief that bite mark evidence could be used as a new tool up there with fingerprints, toxicology and other established methods. But to be taken seriously, the pioneers needed to establish their reputation, and for that they needed to be recognized as a scientific specialism as worthy of respect as any pathologist. They began in 1976 by forming an 'odontology section' within America's top professional forensics body, the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. Not content with playing second fiddle, they then created their own organization, the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO). As icing on the cake, they granted themselves a fancy title: 'diplomates', they called themselves, signaling their specialist status as trained and authoritative experts. So when Souviron travelled the country to appear as a star expert witness in criminal cases such as McCrory's murder trial, he did so not as Richard Souviron, dentist from Florida, but as Dr Richard Souviron, board-certified diplomate and member of the ABFO. How could a jury resist that? 'This was 1985, when to fly an 'expert' witness in from Florida was practically unheard of,' McCrory wrote in his letter to the Guardian, referring to his own trial. 'No jury, as lay people, have the ability to genuinely question a supposed expert, especially back then.' The problem was, bite mark analysis, like many of the new forensic techniques, was founded upon so much hot air. There are two stages involved in matching a wound to an individual perpetrator, and both of them are flakey. The first is categorically to confirm that the wound is caused by someone's teeth and not by some other sharp object. The second stage is to link the alleged bite mark to the dental pattern of the suspect, by taking a mould of the suspect's teeth and comparing it to the wound. Analysis in both those stages, contrary to the scientific method, is subjective. A study published in 2009 by New York scientists tested whether skin could accurately record the impressions left by teeth - the 3D-equivalent of a fingerprint - and found that it could not. The scientists simulated 23 identical bites on a single piece of un-embalmed cadaver skin. They discovered that the bites produced 23 entirely different marks, each one bearing little resemblance to the rest. A more detailed study in 2015, carried out by ABFO-certified forensic dentists themselves, asked 38 of their fellow 'diplomates' to review photographs presented in real criminal cases where bite mark analysis had been used. Of the 100 cases they examined, the analysts reached unanimous agreement in only four. These two experiments effectively toppled the entire house of cards upon which bite mark analysis had been erected. In his book, Fabricant concludes that when forensic dentists presented juries with a 'near certain' match between the marks on a victim and a suspect - as Souviron did at McCrory's trial - all they were doing was expressing their own personal opinion. It is a paradox that it took science to overcome junk science. 'Nothing else could have challenged it other than DNA evidence, because a clean DNA sample is indisputable,' Fabricant said. 'DNA was like a truth serum that the justice system had never before been exposed to.' Over the years, DNA analysis has demonstrated itself to be blessed with all the qualities that junk science claims to enjoy but lacks: reliability, certainty, accuracy, indisputability. The DNA revolution was launched in 1992 when two young lawyers in New York City decided to take on the combined might of the criminal justice system just as it was getting into its mass incarceration stride. Barry Sheck and Peter Neufeld founded the Innocence Project to take on cases where crime scene evidence allowed DNA testing to be carried out. They used it to expose wrongful convictions and secure exonerations - more than 200 to date attained by the Innocence Project alone. As time passed, the group's crack team of lawyers observed that in so many of the wrongful convictions, the prosecution had relied upon the testimony of forensic scientists. Almost half of the total of 375 exonerations that have been achieved by the Innocence Project and other groups using DNA evidence involved the misuse of forensic sciences. The dawning realization that junk science might have put a vast mountain of innocent people behind bars has inspired the Innocence Project to make a historic revision of its mission. As it approaches its 30th anniversary this year, the organization has decided to widen the net of cases that it takes on to include those where no DNA evidence is available. That's a big change in focus. Up to now, the Innocent Project has pinpointed its energies almost exclusively on DNA. But what about people who cannot call on DNA to prove their innocence, maybe because there were insufficient crime scene materials, or maybe because such materials were destroyed post-trial? Are those people to be abandoned with little hope of ever receiving justice? 'Those who can be exonerated with DNA evidence represent just the tip of the iceberg,' Christina Swarns, the executive director of the Innocence Project, told the Guardian. 'Going forward, the Innocence Project will begin to accept non-DNA cases and we will approach them with the same tenacity, innovation and client-centered approach we brought to our DNA work.' This is a significant paradigm shift for an organization that put the concept of wrongful conviction on the map, both in the United States and around the world. By widening its focus to include non-DNA cases, Fabricant believes it will herald 'a new era of innocence litigation that will involve undoing the legacy of junk science'. Which prompts the question: how many innocent people are out there? 'I shudder to think,' Fabricant said. 'There are 2.3 million people incarcerated in this country. Even if the wrongful conviction rate were 1% , and that's conservative, you are looking at tens of thousands of people.' Fabricant is convinced that McCrory, who is now 62, is one of them. 'Mr McCrory is obviously innocent, and he would be out right now if we had DNA evidence.' Julie Bonds was murdered on 31 May 1985 in her home in Andalusia, south Alabama. McCrory was not living in the house at the time - the couple had recently separated after 10 years of marriage; they had one son together. McCrory and his father discovered her body after they called on the house, worried that she was not answering the phone. She had been badly beaten, and had a deep wound to her skull. The 1985 McCrory trial was held just before DNA analysis came on stream - the first time DNA was used to convict someone was in Florida in 1987, while the first DNA exoneration followed two years later in Chicago. Because it was presumed to serve no further useful purpose, all the crime scene materials collected in the Bonds murder investigation were destroyed  - a routine event in pre-DNA days. That left no biological samples to test once DNA was commonplace.  Detectives investigating the Bonds murder actually found hairs clutched in the hand of McCrory's murdered wife that conventional examinations conducted at the time ruled out as having come from him. But the hairs, along with everything else, were binned. Other evidence also pointed to McCrory's innocence. At the time of Bonds' killing, a construction worker was being employed on a building project in the house next door. He wore a red bandana. Five weeks after Julie Bonds was murdered, that same man was arrested for breaking into a different home and raping the owner. He served 20 years in prison. At that crime scene, officers found a red bandana. Despite the inconsistencies in his case, McCrory was at a powerful disadvantage. Without the benefit of DNA to clear his name, he languished in prison for decades. Meanwhile, however, bitemark analysis was beginning to unravel.  In 2009 - by which time McCrory had spent 24 years in prison - the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) released a 300-page report on the use of forensic science that sent what Fabricant called a 'thunderbolt' across the criminal justice system. It was searingly critical of 13 forensic techniques that were routinely being used in criminal trials. It reserved its most scathing denunciation for bitemark analysis. The report's authors noted that the claim that dentists could positively identify a perpetrator by matching their dental patterns to marks on victims' bodies had never been supported by any scientific study. Indeed, 'no large population studies have been conducted'. In other words, bitemark analysis was an unsubstantiated whim on the part of its inventors. The report concluded that there was 'no evidence of an existing scientific basis for identifying an individual to the exclusion of all others'. The combined impact of the NAS report and DNA evidence led to a renewed focus on criminal cases where bitemark analysis had been critical to the prosecution. Scientific certainty began to crumble. Exonerations mounted up. Today, the tally of people who have been exonerated after wrongful indictment or conviction involving bitemark analysis stands at 35. They include several of Fabricant's clients: Keith Allen Harward, exonerated in 2016 after spending 33 years in prison for a rape and murder he did not commit; Stephen Chaney, exonerated in 2019 after 28 years behind bars; Eddie Lee Howard, exonerated in 2020 - 26 years inside. They were the lucky ones. David Wayne Spence was convicted of murdering three teenagers in 1982 after his teeth were matched to bite marks on the victims' bodies. On 3 April 1997, he was strapped to a gurney and lethal drugs injected into his veins. He went to his death insisting he was innocent. In December 2019, Souviron recanted his testimony. He had taken another look at the evidence in the case, considered it alongside the criticisms raised by the NAS report, and went on the record to say he had been wrong. 'While this testimony was understood by myself and others within my field as scientifically acceptable at the time of trial, I would not give [it] today,' he said in an affidavit. 'As a forensic odontologist I no longer believe the individualised teeth marks comparison testimony I offered in his case was reliable or proper. I therefore renounce that testimony.' The Guardian reached out to Souviron to ask him how he came to change his thinking so radically, but his office said he was not available. The dentist's reversal was sweet music to McCrory's ears. 'We knew a recantation from the state's own witness, their only forensic witness, would eviscerate their case. At that point the only fair way forward would be a new trial,' the prisoner wrote. McCrory duly petitioned for a new trial. With no forensic evidence of any sort, and with no other substantive evidence to rely upon, the state's tank was running on empty. Even the prosecutors admitted that McCrory posed no harm to the public. In April last year, on the eve of a court hearing to determine whether a new trial should be granted, the prisoner was offered a plea deal. He could walk free, that very same day, on one condition. He had to plead guilty to his wife's murder. He declined the deal, opting to stay in his cell. 'That was an easy decision,' he wrote in his letter to the Guardian. 'I did not murder her ... I didn't do it, and I'm not admitting to it.' He added: 'Someone murdered Julie. Someone knows who it is. We are seeking the truth, not falsely confessing to a crime I didn't commit.' Many people would find McCrory's rejection of a deal that would have instantly set him free hard to comprehend. Fabricant is among them. 'I can understand it in an intellectual way, but as a human being I think after 36 years I'd want to go home,' he said. McCrory still hasn't gone home. It has now been 37 years and counting. The bitemark case against him has been thoroughly debunked, but it turns out that doesn't matter. Junk science proves to be scarily resilient - an invasive weed that grows rampant across the country, poisoning the criminal justice system as it spreads. A few days after McCrory turned down the plea deal, an evidentiary hearing was held in front of Judge Charles Short in Andalusia, Alabama, to discuss the request for a new trial. Souviron's recantation was presented to the court, as was the testimony of three other forensic dentists who not only confirmed that the marks on Julie Bond's body could not be matched to the prisoner, they said that the marks were not even caused by teeth in the first place. Judge Short listened to this devastating argument, took in all the other evidence of McCrory's innocence, then issued his ruling: there would be no new trial; McCrory would remain in prison. Fabricant was uncharacteristically lost for words when he tried to describe his reaction to the judgment. 'How can that be? How can that be? It's preposterous. We are in 2022 and a judge is refusing a new trial even when the scientist in question has recanted. He is keeping an innocent man in prison based on nothing.' Despite the knock-back, McCrory says he is keeping his spirits up. 'I'm optimistic that justice will prevail,' he wrote at the end of his letter. 'Every time we have run into a seemingly dead-end, a door has opened. We will not stop until we have the truth.' This will be scant comfort to McCrory, but he is not alone. Fabricant points out that bitemark analysis is still admissible in all 50 states of the union. Three of the most influential bitemark cases where marks were matched to 'guilty' perpetrators have all ended in exonerations. Yet the cases retain their status as 'good law' and continue to be cited as precedent in court to this day. In the wider world of junk science, not only do discredited techniques continue to be used, but new techniques keep popping up. Fabricant rattles off three examples of forensic innovations that are beginning to ring alarm bells. There's forensic podiatry, where foot doctors claim they can identify a perpetrator from their gait; cadaver dogs which are supposedly able to sniff out the presence of a human corps even years after the body may have been present; and ShotSpotter, an audio system that purports to be able to isolate the sound of gun shots from other noise in urban areas. If that all sounds depressingly familiar, that's because it is. 'Our goal in the Innocence Project is to go out of business - we aspire to become unnecessary,' Fabricant said. 'It appears we are going to be around for a very long time to come.'", "aae38720ce67fe4a58e958775e4953c886c5ad95d51e97fed8c69c0e": "While the United States formally recognizes a constitutional right to abortion, state-level restrictions have placed this right out of reach for many.

'We've been preparing for a very long time for these elections,' said the acting party president, Jordan Bardella. 'It's essential our ideas are defended in the assembly.' He said his party would take a stand on security, immigration and French identity issues in parliament, as well as taxes. 'People have to vote,' he said on the CNews TV channel. 'We need an opposition.' Le Pen was beaten by the centrist Emmanuel Macron in Sunday's presidential election by 58.5% to 41.5%, but she gained a historic score for the far right, with more than 13m votes. She will run again in the parliamentary elections in June and is likely to keep her seat in the Pas-de-Calais area in northern France. Her party has in the past struggled to translate its high number of votes in the presidential election into seats in parliament. This is partly due to a two-round parliamentary voting system that does not favour small parties, as well tactical voting to keep out the far right. Abstention is also traditionally far higher in parliamentary elections than in presidential elections, which has had a negative impact on the National Rally's results. In 2017, the year of the last parliamentary election, Le Pen won more than 10m votes in the presidential final against Macron, but weeks later her party and its associated lawmakers won only eight seats in the 577-seat parliament. The party believes its chances are better this June because last Sunday's presidential vote showed Le Pen had expanded her support across a greater geographical area, including a strong showing in the south-east as well as the north and north-east. 'We're in a very different situation this time because we arrived first in 159 constituencies [in the presidential vote] compared to 45 in 2017,' said Gilles Pennelle, a party delegate who is expected to be a candidate in Brittany. The party has not fixed a public target of how many seats it wants to win. Several party figures have said they hope to win at least enough to form a parliamentary grouping, which would mean at least 15 seats. A National Rally parliamentary grouping, if headed by Le Pen, would give her a bigger platform and higher visibility, useful if she decides to run for a fourth time for the presidency in 2027, which is not yet clear. In recent parliamentary elections that follow the presidential vote, the party of the newly elected president has always won a majority. A poll on Monday by Harris Interactive suggested Macron would secure a ruling majority, winning 326 to 366 seats out of 577, if he manages to strike a broad centre-right alliance with smaller parties including the rightwing Les Republicains. But an Elabe poll on Wednesday found that 61% of French people wanted a parliamentary majority that was opposed to Macron. The radical leftwinger Jean-Luc Melenchon is attempting to form an alliance of parties on the left in an attempt to gain a maximum of seats. His party, France Unbowed, currently has 17 seats in parliament.", "54c97da6296e8c848ff9b37b6865da5c68b4852a785d2535a7f70084": ""}
