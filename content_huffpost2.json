The government efficiency minister said the government wanted to bring the Whitehall headcount back to where it was in 2016. He said the extra staff were brought in to help deal with the pandemic and the 'aftermath of Brexit'. Rees-Mogg told Sky News: 'I know it sounds eye-catching but it's just getting back to the civil service we had in 2016... since then we've had to take on people for specific tasks. 'So dealing with the aftermath of Brexit and dealing with Covid, so there's been a reason for that increase, but we're now trying to get back to normal.' The minister said there was currently too much 'duplication' in Whitehall, and insisted most of the jobs could be lost by not replacing the 38,000 civil servants who leave the government every year. He said: 'What I've seen within the Cabinet Office, which is where I work and bear in mind each secretary of state will be responsible for is or her own department, is that there's duplication within government, so you have a communications department and then you have within another department some people doing communications. 'So it's trying to ensure that you use the resources that you've got rather than duplicating it bit by bit.' Asked why the cuts were not being described as a return to austerity, he said: 'I don't think it is because what is being done is getting back to the efficiency levels we had in 2016.' Rees-Mogg has previously angered civil servants by leaving notes on the desks of those not in the office in an attempt to discourage working from home. They read: 'Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon. Wish every good wish.' The drive has been branded 'vindictive' by Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA representing senior civil servants, who said ministers were out of step with practice in the private sector.",

The outgoing commissioner acknowledged this, prior to her departure saying: 'We know a precious bond has been broken and I am committed to rebuilding the trust and confidence of all Londoners.' Winning back this trust won't be easy, but it is vital. Victims of crime need to have absolute trust and faith in those to whom they will tell their story. Already fewer than one in six women report rape, as they fear the police won't do anything about it.  But the lack of trust goes much deeper than a fear that interaction with police will result in lack of action: The horrific case of Sarah Everard, raped and murdered by serving Met police officer Wayne Couzens, has left women afraid.  While it has always been the approach of police forces to label criminality by police officers as the work of 'bad apples', the litany of ignored incidents by a man nicknamed 'the rapist' by colleagues speaks of an organisation with little regard for women's safety.  Couzens had joined the Met from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary before being assigned to the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection (PaDP) branch, but had not undergone enhanced vetting nor gone through the mandatory two-year probation period with the Met before joining the PaDP.  There were at least three allegations of indecent exposure filed against him. Radio presenter Emma B also came forward to say that she had attempted to report Couzens in 2008, after he flashed her in an alley in Greenwich, but that the Police had laughed at her.  We now need to know that police vetting will be stepped up and that behaviour such as that displayed by Couzens will not be tolerated. Indeed, it would not be in most work places. Even within Sarah's case there are more examples of deeply disturbing police behaviour.  An officer who had been a part of the search was suspended from duties after sharing an inappropriate graphic on social media, five officers were placed under investigation for sharing grossly offensive material with Couzens before he killed Sarah and several officers gave character references supportive of Couzens during his sentencing hearing.  Several female officers told the press that they did not feel as if they could report concerning behaviour by male colleagues. So another question that needs answering from all applicants for the commissioner job is how they will root out this behaviour, rid the Met of this hugely offensive culture and make sure anyone reporting concerning actions - including other police staff -- is protected.  If female police officers feel unsafe making reports to colleagues, it is hard to see how other women could possibly feel able to. The sharing of offensive material appears epidemic by Met police officers. Last December two Met police constables who took photos of the bodies of murdered sisters of Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry and shared the images on WhatsApp groups were jailed for 33 months.  Meanwhile, officers at Charing Cross police station were found to have joked about rape and exchanged offensive social media messages.  In April, responding to the IOCP investigation into the Charing Cross police station, the police said they would have a zero-tolerance approach to misogyny. Yet, of the 14 officers investigated, nine are still serving, while another is working as a contractor in a staff role. I am not sure this sounds like 'zero tolerance'. Talk about organisational cultural change is easy - finding ways and implementing them is much harder. But women and girls simply cannot be safe whilst misogyny is allowed to be part of the Met's culture.  Like women across the capital, I look forward to hearing the new commissioner's plans for fundamental change. Ellie Reeves is Labour's shadow minister for justice and the MP for Lewisham West and Penge.   ",
    "eec37c55c053c41eb69145351e0deefea0425ad68a6ec0f1fe9dc7b9": "Sebastian Vettel has said he is a hypocrite for championing environmental issues while continuing to race in Formula 1. Appearing on BBC's Question Time, the four-time world champion said the global climate crisis has made him question whether continuing in the sport is the right thing to do. When asked by presenter Fiona Bruce whether being a star in a 'gas guzzling' sport and campaigning for reducing carbon emissions made him a hypocrite, he replied: 'It does.'  Vettel wore a T-shirt ahead of last weekend's inaugural Miami Grand Prix which read: 'Miami 2060. First Grand Prix under water. Act now or swim later.' But when it was put to the German, who won four consecutive titles with Red Bull between 2010 and 2013, that he competes in one of the most gas-guzzling sports in the world and if that makes him a hypocrite, he replied: 'It does, it does and you [the audience] are right when you laugh because there are questions I ask myself every day. 'I am not a saint but I am very concerned about the future.' Vettel continued: 'It is something I ask myself [whether I should be racing in Formula One] and travelling the world. 'It is my passion to drive a car and I love it, and every time I step in a car I love it, but when I get out of the car I am thinking: 'is this something we should do, travelling the world and wasting resources?' 'On the other hand, we are entertaining people and during Covid-19, we were one of the first sports to start again. When everybody's heads were about to explode there were F1 races on. 'In terms of entertainment, there are sports, culture, comedy and a lot of people who could not perform [during that time] and a lot of people missed that and if we did not have this in general we would probably go mad. 'There are things I do because I feel I can do them better. Do I need to take a plane every time [to a race]? No, not when I can take a car. There are certain things in my control and certain things I cannot control.' Vettel's Aston Martin deal expires at the end of this season's record-breaking 23-race calendar. F1 bosses have promised that the sport will be sustainably fuelled by 2026 and net-zero carbon by the start of the next decade.",

    "a795dac30a8c07925bf9bfcd7920b3b78542f7d2209429aa338850df": "We've all been there: you're out of the house for most of the day, or exploring a new city on a trip, and you realise you didn't bring a phone charger with you. This realisation often comes around the time you notice your battery is running low. And sometimes, buying a new charger isn't an option. Having your phone battery die is hardly the end of the world, but it can certainly pose challenges if you need to navigate an unfamiliar place or keep in contact with people. Fortunately, there are ways to extend your battery life and buy yourself some time before you can reach a charger. Below, tech experts share their tips. Turn on low power mode 'Most phones nowadays have a battery-saving feature, and iPhones specifically have a feature called 'low power mode,'' says technology reviewer and journalist Elly Bailey, aka Elly Awesome. 'This reduces or alters many features to save battery life, such as your phone's display brightness, automatic downloads, background app refresh and more. So, if you can toggle this on, it's a no-brainer. While iPhones automatically ask users if they'd like to turn on low power mode once the battery falls below a 20% charge, turning it on even sooner can help save more power. You can find the 'low power mode' option under the Battery tab in Settings on iPhones and the analogous 'battery saving mode' feature in the same place on Android phones. Disable location services 'Some apps keep close track [of] your location, even when you're not using them,' notes Jessica Naziri, founder of the technology and lifestyle blog TechSesh. 'They do this through a process called Location Services, and although it's meant to be unobtrusive, it can take up precious amounts of battery power.' Naziri advised going into your settings and turning off location tracking for all your apps at once, or going through them one by one and making choices. Turning off location services means those apps will use less power. Bailey made a similar recommendation: 'If you're really desperate to keep that last bit of charge, I would suggest going into your location services and turning it off - if this isn't a safety issue for you.' Reduce screen brightness 'Your phone's display is one of its most power-hungry components, so if you've got the brightness slider pegged at maximum, it's going to drain your battery in no time,' says technology writer and video creator Michael Fisher, aka MrMobile. 'If you're not outdoors in broad daylight, bumping that brightness down a little - or a lot - is a great way to conserve battery power.' Naziri notes to 'make sure the 'auto-brightness' is turned on, so the screen will automatically dim if you're in a dark setting.' Go into dark mode Reducing screen brightness isn't the only display adjustment you can make to help extend your battery life. 'If your phone has an OLED screen (most modern high-end phones do), switching your software to dark mode can save battery, since dark pixels on an OLED panel take no power to illuminate,' Fisher says. 'They're just off.' Dark mode is available under Display & Brightness in iPhone settings and under Display in Android settings. Turn off Wi-Fi Many features that make smartphones such a great convenience - like Wi-Fi access - naturally use a good bit of battery power. So if your goal is to prevent reaching 0% before you can get to a phone charger, disable those functions. 'Turn off extra features like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi if you're not using them,' Bailey advises.  Close battery-draining apps If you want to preserve battery, pay attention to the apps you have open on your phone and what they're doing. 'Those apps that suck up our time are also the biggest battery-drainers,' Naziri notes. 'I'm talking about social media apps including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Snapchat, YouTube and WhatsApp. And if you're low on juice, this is your reminder that FaceTime and playing games can kill the battery much faster than you can reach a charger.' Watching videos and playing games are taxing on batteries, so keep this in mind if you're trying to preserve power. Turn off push notifications for apps and close them strategically. 'Make sure background apps aren't performing power-intensive tasks - eg. Spotify downloading a new playlist, or Google Photos performing a backup,' Fisher advises. 'Note that this doesn't mean you should go on a swiping spree, closing out all your apps. That might feel good, but it causes more harm than good by interfering with your phone's automatic background management. The preferred approach here is a precision strike, not carpet bombing.' Turn on airplane mode 'If you're using your phone for offline features, or otherwise don't need constant connectivity before you can find a charger, toggle airplane mode,' Fisher suggests. 'This disables all the wireless radios, which saves a fair amount of power.' Turning on airplane mode preserves power and serves as a good reminder to stay off your phone until you can plug it into a charger.  'Personally, when I put my phone on airplane mode, I only remove it when I need to do an urgent or necessary action,' says Marie-Philippe Gill, creator of Girl Knows Tech. Don't skip app updates In addition to the above steps you can take in the moment to preserve battery, there are more general ways to promote longer battery life.  'Don't skip app updates,' Naziri advises. 'If you've been putting updates off, this is your sign - improving efficiency and battery management along the way. In fact, you should probably just turn on auto-update if you can.'  Be mindful about charging It's also important to keep overall battery health in mind when you are able to charge your phone.  'Fast charging is convenient, but it reduces the overall longevity of your battery,' Fisher notes. 'If your phone has a 'smart charging' or 'healthy charging' mode and you're not in a rush (say, if you're sleeping and charging overnight), use it. It will charge the battery slowly and prolong its life.' He also advised carrying an external battery pack, or asking a friend if you can use their phone to charge yours through the 'power share' or 'reverse wireless charging' features, if that's an option.  'I usually try to follow Apple's guidelines on battery health,' Gill says. 'For example, I try to minimise the amount of battery cycles that my devices go through.' Naziri says she generally avoids charging her phone to a full 100% when possible. 'A lithium-ion battery doesn't like to be fully charged or warm,' she explains. 'The lithium-ion batteries in our phones last longest when we keep them charged between 30% and 80% throughout the day - not just topped up to 100%, then down to zero. Also, wireless charging is so convenient, but batteries prefer a slow and steady input. Consider using a standard charger when you can.'",

Now the two semi-finals are behind us, we're ready for the main event, with everything from Euro-bangers and heartbreaking ballads to dancing wolves and some throwback noughties rock to keep us entertained on Saturday night. Just two questions remain now. Who are the frontrunners? And are they any good? Well, wonder no longer, as we round up our ones to watch at this year's Eurovision, our verdicts on their competing songs and even their winning odds (via Betfair)... Kalush Orchestra - Stefania Representing: Ukraine Odds: 8/15 Our verdict: For obvious reasons, Ukraine is the odds-on favourite to be crowned this year's Eurovision winners, and between traditional imagery of Ukrainian beauty showcased on stage mixed with the band's passionate performance, this one is sure to pack an emotional punch on the Turin stage. It's worth noting, though, that even outside of the context of the tragedies still ongoing in Ukraine, the Kalush Orchestra's offering would still be one of the strongest of the year (hardly surprising, given Ukraine always deliver something remarkable at Eurovision, one way or another). Like Go_A last year, the group have taken traditional elements of Ukrainian music and put a contemporary twist on them by including rap verses and electronic instruments, while including a message of maternal love that transcends language barriers. And while it's pretty much a dead cert that the public will be showing their support for Ukraine at Eurovision with their votes - the question remains whether the juries will be doing the same. Mahmood & Blanco - Brividi Representing: Italy Odds: 4/1 Our verdict: In a year that's actually pretty heavy on ballads, this passionate tune between returning star Mahmood (who came in second place with Soldi back in 2019) and Italian musician Blanco (primarily known as a rapper in his home country, interestingly enough) stands out for the sheer drama that it delivers on. Sung entirely in Italian, the two musicians swap lines about the difficulties of a turbulent romance over the course of the lush and orchestral track, and their voices sound really beautiful together. Brividi has already had huge success in Italy, and impressively landed among the five most-played songs on Spotify worldwide when it was first released, so it's undoubtedly one to keep an eye out for. If they do win, Italy will become the first country to triumph at Eurovision two years in a row since Ireland back in the early 90s (when they pulled off the still-amazing triple win). Sam Ryder - Space Man Representing: UK Odds: 7/1 Our verdict: After last year's result, we didn't think we'd be seeing the UK so far up the list of potential winners any time soon - but that's the power of a good song (not to mention the power of a UK representative who understands Eurovision as much as Sam Ryder seems to). This year a number of the favourites have leaned into traditional elements from the country they're representing, which is kind of what Sam has done with his lyrical and musical nods to Queen, David Bowie and Elton John - who he told HuffPost UK were his 'holy trinity' of British musicians - within Space Man. Unlike some of his predecessors, Sam has also put in the leg-work when it comes to promoting his track. As he put it: 'We wanted to make sure that no matter what happens at the end of this, we can look back and say 'we didn't leave any stone unturned'. We went everywhere, we sang on street corners, we did TV promo in countries where the UK entrant has never gone before. 'We paid respect to the actual institution of Eurovision, because the fans deserve that. And I think that's also your responsibility.' And while we can't say we're 100% convinced Space Man is a winning track, we're still backing Sam all the way, and can't wait to see if his hard work pays off on the night. Cornelia Jakobs - Hold Me Closer Representing: Sweden Odds: 9/1 Our verdict: We're going to be completely candid and say we've been obsessed with Hold Me Closer since Cornelia's first performance at Melodifestivalen way back in February, and we're over the moon that the whole world is going to get a chance to fall in love with this song. Sweden has become known for sending undeniable bangers like Benjamin Ingrosso's Dance You Off, Mans Zelmerlow's Heroes and, of course, the iconic Euphoria by Loreen. It's interesting, then, that this year's offering is a ballad, particularly one as straight-up heartbreaking as Hold Me Closer, on which a downcast Cornelia sings about an inevitable break-up. There's still enough here to keep your average pop fan interested, though, including the slow build-up of Cornelia's passionate delivery and the mix of organic instruments and electronics on the production - even if it doesn't have you up dancing around the sofa. One way it does hark back to some of Sweden's greatest Eurovision stars, though, is the simplicity of both the track and its staging, which we can only imagine will help the message of the song really shine through on the Turin stage. Amanda Tenfjord - Die Together Representing: Greece Odds: 20/1 Our verdict: Anyone who thinks Eurovision is about cramming as many gimmicks and elaborate costumes into a three-minute space as possible needs to take a listen to what Greece is serving up this year. Mixing the sounds of Lorde, Billie Eilish and Imogen Heap with a touch of Olivia Rodrigo, Amanda Tenfjord's emotional tune Die Together is almost completely acapella for a full minute, with the sparse production letting her heartbreaking lyrics really resonate, and the build-up that comes later feel all the more satisfying. Quite how this will translate to the big Eurovision stage remains to be seen, but if she can pull it off (and she gets a decent spot on the running order, so she doesn't blend too much into the other ballads on the night), Amanda could definitely be onto a winner. Chanel - Slo Mo Representing: Spain Odds: 18/1 Our verdict: If you're tuning in to Eurovision for bangers and/or a full visual production, then trust us when we say that this is what you've been waiting for. Chanel is serving us a fully bilingual bop here, complete with full choreography and that rare thing of beauty that is a Eurovision dance break just for good measure. In a year that's relatively low on upbeat numbers, SloMo may well be just what people need as a palate cleanser after a string of ballads and midtempo tunes, and we definitely think it's going to make people sit up and pay attention. There are obvious comparisons to be made to Eleni Foureira's Fuego here, but this is far from a retread of what we've already seen at the competition. Between Spain, Italy and the UK, the big five are really bringing it this year, and we defy anyone not to be dancing along with Chanel by the finish (even if our armchair moves are somewhat less impressive than hers). Subwoolfer - Give That Wolf A Banana  Representing: Norway Odds: 50/1 Our verdict: Well, there always has to be some element of novelty at Eurovision, doesn't there? Norway's entry is definitely one of the year's most controversial, thanks in no small part to its borderline-nonsensical lyrics, including lines like 'not sure you have a name, so I will call you Keith', 'if you don't like the name Keith I'ma call you Jim' and the earworm chorus: 'Before that wolf eats my grandma give that wolf a banana'. Alrighty then. Completing the ridiculousness are Subwoolfer's bright yellow wolf costumes and their accompanying dance routine which, in what we're sure is no accident, is totally TikTok-ready. It might all seem like a bit of silly fun, but Subwoolfer are genuine contenders - and they've got the Spotify streams to prove it, so we definitely wouldn't count them out just yet. Oh, and for any millennial pop fans out there, that's Ben Adams (the one with the curtains from 90s boyband A1) underneath one of those masks. Konstrakta - In Corpore Sano Representing: Serbia Odds: 80/1 Our verdict: Another of the year's more unusual offerings is this folksy number from Serbian singer-songwriter Konstrakta. At first glance, there's not a great deal to this song or its performance, aside from Konstrakta giving her hands a scrub while surrounded by some fairly intimidating backing singers. It's only when you give the lyrics a run through Google translate you realise there's a bit more going on than you might realise. 'What's the secret to Meghan Markle's healthy hair?' Konstrakta sings at the beginning of the song, before referencing everything from 'an enlarged spleen', the 'autonomic nervous system' and walking the dog on a summer's day, which suffice to say has left a lot of room for interpretation, with fans online offering their own theories about exactly what the lyrics might mean. In fact, the song seems to deal with the importance placed on good physical health and traditional beauty at the expense of mental health, particularly after the Covid-19 pandemic. The Rasmus - Jezebel Representing: Finland Odds: 100/1 Our verdict: Rock has always had its place on the Eurovision stage, whether that's the heavy metal stylings of Lordi's Hard Rock Hallelujah or the more contemporary stylings of Maneskin. This year, The Rasmus are taking up the rock mantle on behalf of Finland, with their tune Jezebel. It's a total throwback to the emo era of the 2000s, and also happens to be catchy as hell. We'll admit we don't quite see it among the big hitters like Italy, Ukraine and Sweden - but it's bound to score a few votes from anyone who spent their teenage years rocking out in their bedroom to In The Shadows. The Eurovision Song Contest final airs live on Saturday night at 8pm on BBC One.",
    "f8235481645b483e719817624299a0ec359692b2800fe6b3e81e5616": "It's 3pm, and your boyfriend/girlfriend/partner/crush hasn't messaged you back (if at all). You try not to hover over your chat, waiting for their 'last seen' to turn to 'online'.  In an age of digital intimacy, it's totally normal to fret over online connection, the abundance of it and its quality. Are we making an effort to converse enough? Are we updating one another about our days, our lives? Are we utilising the resources at our disposal - pictures, GIFS, emojis, videos and voice notes (love them or hate them?) - to show that we care? During a pandemic that took most of our interactions online, we've grown accustomed to relationship maintenance and courting turning virtual, too. So much so that someone has come up with a name for this attachment: 'Whatsapp Intimacy'. Coining the term for the New York Times's Modern Love column, writer Layla Kinjawi Faraj even suggests this connective need is a 'sixth love language' - for her and her Syrian family and the wide diaspora, a necessary bond between loved ones separated by many oceans and borders. While quality time, words of affirmation, physical touch, receiving gifts, and acts of service remain the five primary love languages named and identified by Gary Chapman in 1992, there are alternative ways of expressing your affection. WhatsApp (other messaging media are available!) has long bridged the distance between lovers, family members and friends unable to meet regularly. Even among those who share proximity, life online means constant communication and almost limitless opportunity to 'spend' time together, establishing the mundanity and excitement of day-to-day life that can bring us closer together. It's no wonder then that WhatsApp intimacy might be described as a love language - with many of us expecting a 'good morning' or 'goodnight, I love you' text daily without miss, not to mention little updates throughout the day.  So, why is this style of communication so addictive and where are its pitfalls? We spoke to Charisse Cook, a relationship psychotherapist, to find out how to navigate different love languages where one partner is online more than the other. She tells HuffPost UK: 'WhatsApp creates an immediacy with people that can mimic in-person intimacy. For many people it is reassuring to be reminded of someone's presence in their life throughout the day. Being in contact over WhatsApp allows for short, flirtatious or reassuring messages to be exchanged and that connection to be confirmed and reinforced.' But just as different people hold the other five love languages in greater or lesser regard, not everyone necessarily 'speaks' this one as fluently either. 'Some people may struggle with the expectation of this kind of contact during the day, and feel somewhat suffocated or under undue obligation,' she warns. So what can you do if this is you with a partner (or indeed a friend)? As with most matters of the heart, being open about your needs and limitations is a good rule of thumb. 'Agreeing ahead of time on the amount of messaging that both partners feel they can do wholeheartedly can help manage expectations and reduce upset or disappointment,' advises Cook. 'If one member of the relationship likes to message, they can understand that - for example - three messages from their partner shows a significant effort. 'Likewise, for the member of the relationship for whom constant contact is not necessary, they know they can respond three times and that will be meeting the needs of their partner, and will not be subject to criticism or complaints later on.' Don't want to shoot the (non) messenger? Best follow Cook's simple advice.",
    "b31293dbe2cb490fdc0de1eeaa9b8016b2919e68801df49634970601": "The mood seems to be shifting in the UK with regards to Eurovision this year, and it's largely thanks to one man: Sam Ryder. After - let's be honest - a shaky few years for us at the contest, the Essex-born singer-songwriter seems to have charmed Eurovision fans both around Europe and at home, which is no mean feat when you consider many Brits' attitudes towards the contest of late. This must be music to Sam's ears, who has said changing people's feeling towards Eurovision in the UK is one of his main aims by taking part. 'It's not just about the three minutes on stage,' Sam tells HuffPost UK from Turin during some rare down-time in the lead-up to this year's final. 'That's the grand finale at the end of everything. 'But the build-up is so long, so it's more about what you do with that time, how you carry yourself and what your attitude is publicly. What are you standing for, what is your message that you're trying to put out there? Regardless of winning, that's the real stuff. That's the real task when you sign up to do it. 'I think that's where your eyes have got to be. Not, 'I hope I don't get nil points' or 'I hope I come at a certain place on the leaderboard', it's what you choose to do in the time leading up to it that's going to change those attitudes. 'If we can do well in that regard, and change a certain attitude and try and tear some of that self-perpetuating negativity down, even just a little bit, surely that is the biggest win? That's even more of a win than winning the contest.' Eager as he is to be representing the UK, Sam freely admits he had his own reservations about getting involved, after two back-to-back last place finishes for us - including last year's infamous nil points moment. He recalls: 'My initial reaction was that of a Eurovision fan. Like, 'this is wicked, what an opportunity, I'd love to do this'. And then a split second later, that's when the other voices come in, don't they? Voices that are like, 'yeah but what if you get nil points' or 'this might ruin your career' or 'you'll never work again!'. That sort of stuff.' Still, he insists, those feelings were short-lived. 'It's important to remember that those thoughts are completely fabricated by yourself,' Sam continues. 'No one else is saying those things, you are making them. You are bringing them to life in your mind. 'In regards to past experiences and focussing on that negativity, it's so much better to look forward, and I firmly believe that a positive mindset can completely shift your experience of a situation that you're in. My enthusiasm is greater than my fear of that scoreboard.' And what of those cynics who argued that, after last year's result, the UK should reconsider even taking part in Eurovision? He says: 'If people have a tired view of Eurovision, I would urge them not to put so much weight in your joy coming from where the UK or your country comes on the scoreboard. 'Put your attention and your focus into the time you spend with your family and loved ones watching this bonkersness unfold on TV in front of you, and having an absolute blast.' 'And if the scoring bothers you, turn it off and do the washing up afterwards,' he adds with a laugh. 'That's not what it's all about. I bet everyone else goes out to restaurants or the cinema or the pub, and they don't have to wait for a scoreboard before they leave and go home. Life isn't about that. You can enjoy something despite that.' Here's what else Sam had to say as we asked him about all things Eurovision... Were you always a fan of Eurovision, and has your opinion of it changed over time? I've been a fan since I was a kid, hanging out with my mum and dad, my sisters and my grandad, sitting in my lounge and watching it every year. I've got such memories of joy, and in a way, they're some of the warmest memories I have, actually. All getting together and doing stuff like that, they're rare opportunities where you get to do that. And you carry that tradition on with your friends as you get older. The food gets worse, but the company is always good. What's your earliest memory of watching Eurovision at home? It's not necessarily the songs that I remember, it's more the feeling of sitting with my family. There was always music in our house, my parents are massive music lovers, so of course, Eurovision would be on the telly every year. I have memories of togetherness and family time - and real joy.  What are your three all-time favourite Eurovision songs? My favourite Eurovision moment was Lordi's Hard Rock Hallelujah. I was just starting to learn the guitar around that time. And seeing them on stage, in their prosthetics and big platform shoes, bat wings and battleaxes, what's not to like about that? I've got to shout out Lucie Jones and Never Give Up On You, because she's one of the best vocalists in the UK. Her technique and her pitch are incredible, and she's a lovely human being. Also, Waterloo by ABBA, of course. Because it's a belter.  Obviously besides yourself, who are you rooting for at Eurovision this year? Everyone has taken that leap of bravery to play in front of 200 million people, and so everyone deserves respect, so it would feel a bit like bad manners to pick someone. Everyone is putting themselves on the line in some way, or battling some kind of nerves to get on that stage. Everyone has my admiration in that regard, and everyone is so lovely as well. Why is Eurovision still so important? I think it reminds us how important expression is, and the freedom to express yourself. How many people do you think feel afraid to express themselves freely? And Eurovision... it's amazing, people just feel good in their own skin, and that's inspiring. Or not even your own skin, it might be prosthetics, with regard to Lordi. But I think it's so cool. It's so inclusive, I don't think there's a more accepting fanbase in the world than Eurovision, and I am so humbled and grateful to just be a little part of that story. I'll never forget it.

The co-host of the You, Me and the Big C podcast, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2016, on Monday revealed she is receiving end-of-life care. The mother-of-two said she was sharing the message she 'never wanted to write'. 'We have tried everything, but my body simply isn't playing ball,' she wrote on Instagram and Twitter. 'My active care has stopped and I am now moved to hospice at home care, with my incredible family all around me and the focus is on making sure I'm not in pain and spending time with them.' The podcast, which James co-founded with Lauren Mahon and the late Rachael Bland, has touched millions of lives worldwide. But James wanted to drive this last fundraising push to give 'one final F you to cancer', and has raised more than PS3m for Cancer Research UK. In a statement, Downing Street said the Queen was 'pleased to approve the honour of damehood' be conferred upon James. Prime minister Boris Johnson praised her for her work helping others with cancer. He said: 'If ever an honour was richly deserved, this is it. Deborah has been an inspiration and her honesty, warmth and courage has been a source of strength to so many people. 'Through her tireless campaigning and by so openly sharing her experience she has not only helped in our fight against this terrible disease, she has ensured countless others with the Big C have not felt alone. 'I hope this recognition from Her Majesty - backed I'm sure by the whole country - will provide some comfort to Deborah and her family at this difficult time. My thoughts are with them and Deborah should know she has the country's love and gratitude.' Speaking about the damehood, James told The Sun: 'I don't know what to say. I'm blown away and feel incredibly honoured. 'I don't feel like I deserve this. I can't tell you what this means to my family, it's so much to take in.' She told the newspaper her fund has 'surpassed all expectations', adding: 'I'd love to get it to PS5 million by the end of the weekend.' This is a breaking news story and will be updated.

But just how realistic are these concerns? Here's everything you need to know. What nuclear weapons does Russia have? Russia has the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, although it has cut down on its supplies since the Cold War. The Nuclear Threat Initiative claims that, as of 2022, the country has approximately 6,257 warheads. It also has both smaller tactical weapons along with larger strategic missiles. Tactical nuclear weapons vary in size and strength, but - in the very unlikely event Russia does start to use its nuclear supply - Moscow will probably deploy these first. They can be one kiloton (the equivalent to 1,000 tonnes of explosive substance) while the larger ones can go up to 100 kilotons. Russia's largest strategic weapons are believed to be at least 800 kilotons. For context, the atomic bomb that killed around 146,000 people in Japan during Second World War was 15 kilotons. But, it's important to note that the impact from each of these weapons would depend on the size of the nuke, how far above the ground it detonates and the surrounding area. Aside from Russia, the US, the UK, China, France, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea are all known to have nuclear weapons. Russia - along with the US, UK, China and France - also signed the 1968 Treaty of Non-Proliferation promising to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. What has Putin said about the weapons? Putin has been holding his nuclear arsenal over the West ever since he launched his attack on Ukraine, and has claimed that Russia is 'one of the most potent nuclear powers and also has a certain edge in a range of state-of-the-art weapons'. The country's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov then warned in April that the risk of nuclear war was 'considerable' because the West continues to supply Ukraine with weapons, even though the West has done this since the invasion began. Russia has also repeatedly promised that its nuclear weapons will be used 'exclusively as a means of deterrence', although it's not entirely unclear what would qualify as a provocation to Moscow. Why would Putin deploy them now? The invasion has not gone to plan Russia's invasion of Ukraine has definitely not gone as smoothly as the Kremlin originally planned. The Russian forces' attack has been barbaric and caused millions of Ukrainians to flee. But, with skyrocketing losses and no real victory in any part of Ukraine,  the strength of the nation's resistance continues to take Russia by surprise. The West is teaming up Putin's invasion was at least partially motivated by his fears that the West, particularly Nato, was uniting against him. Since his invasion, Ukraine has decided to step back from the defence organisation. However, Finland - which also shares a border with Russia - has announced it plans to join Nato as soon as possible.  Sweden is considering it as well, despite being neutral historically.  The West appears to be doing the exact opposite of what Putin supposedly wanted and is coming together.  The UK also went further than any Western country and pledged to send troops to Sweden if it comes under attack from Russia on Wednesday. The deputy chairman of the security council, Dmitry Medvedev, said on Thursday that as Nato is still sending weapons to Ukraine, it 'increases the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between Nato and Russia'. Such a conflict, he claimed, could turn into a 'full-blown nuclear war'. Russia's isolation The sanctions in the West are starting to have a real impact on Russia, as prices rise and goods are harder to buy. On top of that, the West is gradually severing its ties with the country's oil and gas industries. Even Germany revealed on Thursday that it believes it can cope with a boycott of Russian gas by this winter, despite being previously reliant on the export. But do people think Putin will actually use them? Director of national intelligence in the US, Avril Haines, warned on Tuesday that defeat in Ukraine could lead to an escalation of tensions. While she clarified that the Russian president is not expected to use a nuclear weapon unless he saw an existential threat to Russia or regime, there is a chance that losing in Ukraine could fall into such a category. Haines said: 'The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means, including imposing martial law, reorienting industrial production, or potentially escalatory military actions to free up the resources needed to achieve his objectives as the conflict drags on, or if he perceives Russia is losing in Ukraine.' However she added that she expects there to be some form of 'signalling beyond what he's done thus far before' if he were seriously considering it. Former US under-secretary of defence for policy, Walter Slocombe, also told the US think tank Atlantic Council: 'There is some non-zero (perhaps a worryingly high 1 or 2%) risk he will carry out his threats.' Not everyone is as concerned though. When Russia moved to put its nuclear deterrent on high alert, defence secretary Ben Wallace dismissed it. He said the move was an attempt to distract 'the world and the public from what he's actually doing in Ukraine'. Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said at the end of April: 'This only means Moscow sense losing hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine.' According to nuclear expert James Acton, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in the US, Putin would use the weapons only to 'terrify everyone and get his way'. Ukraine is also very close to Russia, geographically, and Putin claims the two are one country, meaning the use of a nuke is a high risk move for the Kremlin. Although the Russian leader has crossed lines before (see: invading Ukraine) others such as Kings College London's nuclear expert Dr Heather Williams think that Kremlin's dependence on China would deter such a drastic move. Speaking to the BBC, she said: 'China has a 'no first use' nuclear doctrine. So if Putin did use them, it would be incredibly difficult for China to stand by him. If he used them, he would probably lose China.' What would happen if Russia did use nuclear weapons? In the unlikely event Putin were to use his nuclear power, experts believe he would deploy the weapons in Ukraine and they would be used against the military rather than civilian targets. Former senior staff member for the National Security Council in the US, Jan Lodal, told the Atlantic Council: 'The sequence would look like this: Putin would first create a 'provocation', then hit a high-value target such as Kyiv in hopes of getting Ukraine to accept 'peace at any cost'. 'However, he would also seek to avoid any potential spillover, such as radiation, into any NATO state.' However, it's not clear how the West would respond to a nuclear attack. The UK and its allies would probably want to avoid escalating the situation, but how authority in the face of Putin's dangerous actions at the same time. So far, US intelligence suggests there has been no significant change in Russia's storage of weapons, so they are not deployed and ready to fire. As nuclear expert James Acton told the BBC: 'Once you have crossed the nuclear threshold, there is no obvious stopping point. 'I don't think anyone can have any confidence of what that world would look like.' ",

The foreign secretary told European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic that the bloc needed to budge during a 'tetchy' phone call this morning. She said a failure to do so would leave the UK with 'no choice' but to tear up the agreement on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But in response, Sefcovic said the EU had moved as far as it could and would be making no further concessions. He said: 'The EU cannot solve all the problems created by Brexit and the type of Brexit that the UK chose. 'That is the reason why the EU's position has been consistent: we will not renegotiate the protocol, and the EU is united in this position. 'Unilateral action, effectively disapplying the protocol, is not a solution for the way forward.' He said the commission 'stands ready' to carry on working for a joint solution to the frictions being caused by the accord, and urged the UK 'to do the same'. The UK insists the Protocol, which created a customs border in the Irish Sea, must be radically redrawn in order to protect the Good Friday Agreement and restore power-sharing government at Stormont. If no agreement is reached, legislation over-riding parts of the Protocol is set to be introduced by ministers next week - a move which could trigger a trade war between the UK and EU. In a statement issued after the call between Truss and Sefcovic, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: 'The Foreign Secretary outlined that the UK's overriding priority is to protect peace and stability in Northern Ireland and said that the Northern Ireland Protocol had become the greatest obstacle to forming a Northern Ireland Executive. 'She also noted that the current situation was causing unacceptable disruption to trade and had created a two-tier system where people in Northern Ireland weren't being treated the same as everyone else in the UK. 'She reminded Vice President Sefcovic of the importance of defending the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement, and said that the commission bore a responsibility to show more pragmatism and ensure the protocol delivered on its original objectives.'",

Earlier this year, MPs voted to force ministers to release documents about the prime minister's involvement in the appointment. But in response, the government has simply released the blank form Lord Lebedev was required to fill in by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. It has also published the public citation announcing his appointment, a list of the other peerages awarded at the same time, and a letter congratulating him on the news. Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, said: 'This looks like a cover up and smells like a cover up because it is a cover up.' It followed questions as to whether the PM asked anyone in the security services to reconsider or withdraw their assessment of Lord Lebedev ahead of his appointment in November 2020. Lord Lebedev is the owner of the London Evening Standard and a shareholder in The Independent. His father, the oligarch Alexander Lebedev, was a former KGB agent. In a statement, Cabinet Office minister Michael Ellis said the government was 'committed to openness and transparency'. But he said it had to take into account security concerns as well as the need to maintain the 'integrity' of the honours system. 'It is also the case that when considering requests for information from parliament, the government has a responsibility to consider whether it is in the public interest to place information into the public domain,' he said. 'As laid out in today's House of Commons paper, the disclosure of these documents reflects the need to protect national security, to maintain integrity in the system for the awarding of honours and dignities by the Crown, the vetting of nominees for probity and the data protection rights of individuals.' Ellis added: 'Lord Lebedev is a man of good standing. No complaint has been made about his personal conduct. He has been vocal in his criticism of the Putin regime.' Rayner said: 'If the prime minister is claiming he was not involved in forcing through the award of a peerage to an individual of concern to our intelligence services, he should come clean and publish the documents as Parliament instructed. 'The public have a right to know the truth about Boris Johnson's interference in the appointment of his friend Lord Lebedev, the son and business partner of an ex-KGB agent, to a seat in the heart of our parliament. It is time to get to the bottom of this whole murky business.'",

That's because waiting times are ridiculously long at the moment and some mums are sharing the advice they wish they knew before they had children.  One mum, author Libby Page, says her ultimate parenting advice would be to arrange childcare before the baby is here, so you have nothing to worry about when you want to go back to work. It does depend on the area you live in as some might be in high demand, while others may require a deposit before securing a place, but the general advice it to book it during pregnancy.  Don't forget that many parents register their baby on a waiting list as soon as they're expecting, which means places will go quickly.  Others replied to the thread sharing the difficulties they've had accessing childcare, even when they started extremely early. When should I start my childcare search? According to the Baby Centre, you should start looking during your pregnancy.  They say don't worry if you're unsure whether you'll return to work full-time or part-time, or even at all. Making enquiries as early as you can means you'll be armed with all the information you need to make a decision when the time comes. When do I need to make a decision about childcare? In areas where there's high demand, you may need to secure a childcare place for your baby before they're born or shortly after. However, in most cases you won't need to decide this early. It depends on the kind of childcare you want. According to Baby Centre, these can be   Day Centres which have a waiting list, so be prepared to put your child's name down up to six months before you need the place. You may need to pay a deposit or booking fee.   Childminders usually need to be booked at least a month in advance. However, it's worth making enquiries well before this as demand can vary.   A nanny may take time to find, so start your search at least several months before you need one. You'll need to interview as many nannies as possible to find the right one, and then trial them before they start.   They advise drawing up a list of your first, second and third childcare choices. That way you'll be well informed about your back-up choices, just in case your favourite doesn't work out. The earlier you start, the better.",

The star and mother of three, who found fame as a teenager in the Disney Channel's Lizzy McGuire, is posing nude.  'Who cares?' we hear you say. Well, a lot of people, actually.  Though some are championing the beauty of her photos, others are questioning if it was really necessary for her to get naked.  The pictures have clearly caused a division, but do we always need to have an opinion on what women do with their bodies? Whenever a woman chooses to get naked, there's always a discussion around it. Of course no celebrity is exempt from critique, but why do we always feel the need to comment on their choices? Women have the freedom to be able to do what they want with their bodies, when they want.  The commentary hasn't even stopped with the nudity thing, with people bringing Duff's age into the conversation, even when it sounds like a compliment. Call it Lizzie McGuire fans who can't believe it's been almost two decades since their favourite show wrapped, but suggesting Duff has 'aged like fine wine'? (FYI, she's only 34). Readers are also chewing over the contents of the interview inside the cover. The article focuses on Duff growing to accept her body and rejecting 'Hollywood's standards'. 'I'm proud of my body. I'm proud that it's produced three children for me,' she says. 'I've gotten to a place of being peaceful with the changes my body has gone through. I also want people to know a makeup artist was there putting glow all over my body and someone put me in the most flattering position.' This is all good news - we're happy for Duff, who's spoken about struggling with an eating disorder when she was 17. And we also applaud her honesty about the way these cover shoots work. It's the framing that people have questions about. After all, this is a regular, cis-bodied, slim white woman. And as many have pointed out, Duff can celebrate her body without it being held up as an example of rejecting 'Hollywood's standards'.  Lizzie McGuire might be all grown up, but the way we talk about women's bodies has barely changed in decades.",
    "1213545f89f289c3ad69912383d742caaad528a132514188ce665f85": "A senior Tory MP has called on Rishi Sunak to reject calls for a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies to help tackle the cost of living crisis. Andrew Bowie, a former Conservative Party vice-chairman, told HuffPost UK the move would lead to job losses in the North Sea. The West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine MP said it was the 'consensus view' among all of his Scottish colleagues that a windfall tax was a bad idea. His comments came as it was reported that the chancellor had ordered Treasury officials to assess the impact of a windfall tax, amid growing speculation the government will bring one in. The government has repeatedly rejected calls from Labour and the Lib Dems for a one-off levy on the bumper profits being enjoyed by energy firms due to the global spike in oil and gas prices. However, Sunak today left the door open to bringing in a windfall tax unless the companies use their extra cash to increase investment in things like green energy. 'These companies are making a significant amount of profit at the moment because of these very elevated prices,' he told the BBC.  'What I want to see is significant investment back into the UK economy to support jobs, to support energy security, and I want to see that investment soon. If that doesn't happen, then no options are off the table.' But Bowie told HuffPost UK: 'Scotland's economy would be damaged most by a windfall tax. 'I'm of the belief that any windfall tax would hamper investment and cause uncertainty in the North Sea. 'BP and Shell could swallow it given the size of their operation, but medium-sized businesses would find it difficult. Any change to the fiscal framework could lead to jobs being lost and a lack of investment. 'It gets raised with me by these firms all the time. They are firmly against it and I agree with them. 'Every time I meet with the chancellor I raise it with him. He says he is looking at a variety of options, but I very much hope it is not a windfall tax. 'The last time I spoke with the chancellor he was of the opinion that a windfall tax was not his favoured option and I hope that is not the direction he is heading in.' Asked about the government's position on a windfall tax today, the prime minister's official spokesman said: 'We do keep options on the table - rightly so. 'But, as the prime minister has set out, as the chancellor has said, we do not think this is the right approach. 'We want these companies that are making profits to make further investments. But we are simply not cutting off options given the circumstances that we find.'",

Francesca is the sixth-eldest Bridgerton sibling, and made a handful of appearances in the first two seasons.

The Mysterious Girl singer was mentioned in court as Rebekah was quizzed this week about a 2004 newspaper interview she gave about a purported sexual encounter with Peter. The article carried the headline 'Peter's hung like a small chipolata, shaved, slobbery, lasts five minutes,' with Rebekah now admitting she was 'forced into a situation by my ex-husband' to do the interview. Responding to comments about his anatomy being discussed in court, and subsequently in the media, Peter shared a two-minute video on his social accounts revealing he felt like he 'had to say something'.  'Sorry to Emily [his wife] and the children that have had to see and hear some not very nice things,' he wrote in the caption, before going on to say in the video: 'Seeing as I haven't had much of a say in this, and just let everyone have a laugh and whatever, whatever, I'm just going to put it out.  'Fifteen years this has been going on, and I kept quiet and I didn't say anything, and I let everyone have their laugh and I let everyone say what they wanted to say. 'Okay yes, now, [Rebekah] has gone to court and admitted that the story was made up, and she did that because her ex-husband forced her to do it. Fair enough. 'But put that all aside and just think how it feels that if a man, or if I had said this, about her anatomy, or a man said something about a woman's anatomy, and made up something, whatever, I don't know - you can use your imagination - of saying something very unflattering.  'There would be outrage, there would absolute outrage. But because it's been said about me, it's been the butt of all jokes, I've taken it for fifteen years.' He continued: 'Some of you are gonna go, 'oh get over it, don't say anything, whatever'. You've got to understand, what's even worse is it's brought up in a High Court, and the lawyer is bringing it up... and it's brought up again. And the only one that sits there and takes hit after hit about it is me. 'And I'll be laughing about it for a while, but think about how it would feel if it was the other way around, that's all I'm saying.  'Okay yes, I think we all know now it's just a made-up story fine, fine, fine. But it's a little bit more serious than that. And I think it's not fair that something like this can happen again and again and again. 'We talk about all sorts of things, about mental health, about being kind and about all that sort of stuff, and nothing seems to change.' The high-profile libel battle comes after Coleen accused Rebekah's Instagram account of being behind the leaking of 'false stories' about her private life to the media in October 2019. Rebekah, who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, denies leaking stories to the media and is suing her fellow footballer's wife for libel, while Coleen is defending the claim on the basis her post was 'substantially true'.",

Boris Johnson, his wife and chancellor Rishi Sunak were all fined for attending a birthday party in June 2020 only last month. This was during the first wave of 50 fixed penalty notices issued in the Met's ongoing investigation into Downing Street's Covid breaches. As that number has now more than doubled, the government is coming under further scrutiny. As Johnson decided to hold a cabinet meeting on Thursday Stoke-on-Trent, Sky News' Sam Coates caught the ministers on their way to the gathering - and he didn't hold back. Addressing home secretary Priti Patel, he said: 'Are you embarrassed or are you just going to play deaf to the scale of the law-breaking in No.10. Do you still back the prime minister?' She avoided looking at the camera, briefing saying, 'good morning Sam' and asking the journalist how he is - all the while keeping her gaze steadily on the ground. Michael Gove was up next. He looked directly at the journalist as Coates asked: 'Is it just best to ignore law-breaking in Downing Street Mr Gove, or do you have the full confidence [in] the prime minister?' With a large smile, the levelling up secretary looked at the camera and said: 'Hi Sam!' As Sunak approached, Coates said: 'Chancellor, are you prepared to dig deep to help with the cost of living or is the prime minister going to bounce you into spending more?' The chancellor simply smiled and said, 'morning', before walking on. It wasn't just the cabinet minister who faced a grilling either. When Guto Harri, Downing Street's director of communications, arrived with a crowd of colleagues, Coates asked: 'Guto Harri, is it hard to spin your way out of this one after a hundred fines this morning confirmed by the Met?' Smiling, the spin doctor replied: 'Good morning! How are you?' Nigel Adams - cabinet minister without portfolio - was also filmed arriving for the meeting, prompting the Sky News journalist to ask: 'Have you fixed it for Boris Johnson to get through this despite the scale of law-breaking in No.10?' 'It's great to see you too, Sam,' Adams replied without breaking his stride. 'Wonderful to be here in Stoke.'  Adams actually tweeted about Labour leader Keir Starmer only last week when he was accused of avoiding scrutiny about 'beergate', which is now also under police investigation for breaching Covid rules. He wrote: 'It's not a good look to be dodging questions about #beergate. 'Most voters can spot BS and a #hypocrite from a mile away.' Coates also tweeted clarifying that not all attendees chose to enter the building, where the government will be trying to follow up on its promises from the Queen's Speech, via the TV cameras.",
    "b88e8088dfad8cdcc5b87ac21376cb761494113d0121627098492769": "More than half of patients who were hospitalised with Covid during the pandemic still experience at least one symptom two years after their first infection, according to new findings. In the longest study of its kind, research published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine has revealed that even after being discharged, these Covid patients still experience a lower quality of life and poorer health compared to the rest of the general public. Lead author Professor Bin Cao from the China-Japan Friendship hospital said: 'Our findings indicate that for a certain proportion of hospitalised Covid-19 survivors, while they may have cleared the initial infection, more than two years is needed to recover fully.' The research is particularly eye-opening because the long-term effects of contracting Covid have been, for the most part, unknown until now. The longest study before this looked at patients for around 12 months. How was the study conducted? The experts looked at how 1,192 patients who had acute Covid and were hospitalised in Wuhan (the Chinese province where the disease first broke out) between January 7 and May 29 2020. The patient's average age at discharge was 57. The study then checked in with the individuals at six months, 12 months and two years.  They had to take part in a six-minute walking test, lab tests, questionnaires on their symptoms, mental health, quality of life linked to their health, and if they had gone back to work along with their use of healthcare facilities. For comparison, there was a control group of people who had no history of Covid infection. What did the study find? Half a year after the initial infection, 68% of patients reported at least one long Covid symptom. Two years later, this number dropped to 55%, with 31% reporting fatigue and muscle weakness. Around 11% of the individuals in the study had still not returned to work. The participants were also more likely to report other symptoms including joint pain, palpitations, dizziness and headaches along with extra pain, discomfort, anxiety and depression compared to the control group. Professor Cao said: 'Ongoing follow-up of Covid-19 survivors, particularly those with symptoms of long Covid, is essential to understand the longer course of illness, as is further exploration of the benefits of rehabilitation programmes for recovery. 'There is a clear need to provide continued support to a significant proportion of people who've had Covid-19, and to understand how vaccines, emerging treatments and variants affect long-term health outcomes.' But the findings are not concrete As all individuals involved in the study were treated at Jin Yin-tan Hospital, it's not clear what variants they were infected with. The impact of the virus on an individual's health is thought to vary according to which strain they were infected with - new data has even suggested that Omicron is less likely to trigger long Covid than Delta. Many of the symptoms in the study were self-reported too, meaning there is a chance of information bias. How many people have long Covid in the UK? According to Office for National Statistics, around 1.3 million living in private households experienced self-reported long Covid symptoms as of January 2022. This means more than four weeks after their suspected infection, people are still experiencing Covid symptoms, particularly fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of smell and loss of taste. The prevalence of it is greatest in people aged between 35 and 69 in particular women, people who live in more deprived areas, those who work in health care, social care, teaching and education, or those with another underlying health condition. Is the rate of new Covid cases in the UK dropping? New infections in the UK were steadily falling but have now plateaued. The ZOE Covid Study predicts that UK cases will stall around 100,000 per day. Professor Tim Spector, co-founder of the ZOE app, said: 'It is too early at this stage to know what is causing the slowdown but it's a strong signal that Covid is not going to disappear for summer.' However, the number of hospital patients in England with Covid has dropped to below 10,000 in the UK, suggesting infections are not causing such severe symptoms at the moment.",
    "4207ccc895d6f2215fc1062ce66ca069c4f5f37044b5b2765321580a": "Spain is on its way to becoming the first European country to offer paid menstrual leave, up to three days per month.  The move, set to be introduced from next week after Spain's next cabinet meeting, also welcomes workers to take time off for other reproductive health reasons, such as abortions.  The Secretary of State for Equality and against Gender Violence, Angela Rodriguez, announced a range of measures set to offer women and girls better provisions. The reform also includes free period products to students in school. 'The rights related to menstrual health have never been discussed and the data is chilling,' Rodriguez told a Spanish news website. 'One in four women cannot choose the feminine hygiene products she wants to buy for financial reasons. That is why we propose that they can be dispensed free of charge in educational and social centres.' While not everyone who gets periods will suffer from debilitating symptoms, there are some who experience extreme pain which can be a sign of health conditions such as dysmenorrhea and endometriosis. But the provisions are to be reserved for extreme pain. Rodriguez added: 'It is important to clarify what a painful period is, we are not talking about a slight discomfort, but about serious symptoms such as diarrhoea, severe headaches, fever. 'Symptoms that when there is a disease that entails them, a temporary disability is granted, therefore the same should happen with menstruation and that there is the possibility that if a woman has a very painful period, she can stay home.' Other countries around the world also offer a similar package to menstruating women including Japan, Indonesia, South Korea, and Zambia. So, should the UK be next? And what does it mean for women in the workforce?  While leave that accommodates different needs is certainly welcome, period leave might still perpetuate period stigma. In fact, research shows young women are being subjected to verbal abuse and bullying around their periods, with many of those affected suffering in silence. One in five (20%) of 14-21 year olds has experienced teasing around their periods and made to feel shame, with only half (49%) telling anyone about it. This teasing and bullying often takes place in school - but for one in 10 girls, it has happened online.  Many people have also been missing school and work due to periods, missing out on their work as a result.  Research published in the BMJ in 2019 found 13.8% of women who have periods had missed work or school because of it - but most felt unable to be honest about the reason. Among those who'd called in sick, only 20.1% told their employer or school that their absence was due to menstrual complaints. In Japan, they've considered introducing period badges to alert work staff that a person is menstruating.  But the move faced backlash as it segregates workers and others those who have periods.  It could also lead to discrimination in the workforce, with bosses and companies hiring fewer women over fears of them going on period leave. So what do women need?  Emma Barnett, journalist and author of the book Period told HuffPost: 'I don't think this helps.'   'Women don't need a badge. They need the voice to vocalise any issues their periods present. They also need others - loved ones and colleagues - to rid themselves of their unnecessary and ill-founded squeamishness about a perfectly normal bodily process.' That might certainly be a start. ",
    "7e97bd1bf25bdccba6af8c4ced2cdfccd74f8c723fb1234ecdb35030": " Liz Truss today fired a warning shot to the EU that she is poised to tear up the Northern Ireland Protocol unless they budge in talks.  The Foreign Secretary held what sources described as a 'tetchy' phone call with her European Commission counterpart Maros Sefcovic this morning.  Truss called for the EU to show 'more flexibility and pragmatism' following long-running negotiations. Prior reports suggested she was set to warn Brussels they had just 72 hours to change their position on NI border checks or the UK government would unveil legislation to override the protocol.  The protocol is part of the UK government's Brexit deal that keeps NI aligned with the EU single market for goods as a means of retaining an open Irish border. However, it has resulted in additional checks for goods moving between Great Britain and NI and plunged the region into political crisis.  In a statement, issued after their high stakes call, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: 'The Foreign Secretary noted this with regret and said the situation in Northern Ireland is a matter of internal peace and security for the United Kingdom, and if the EU would not show the requisite flexibility to help solve those issues, then as a responsible government we would have no choice but to act.' Shortly after, Sefcovic also issued a statement saying it was 'simply not acceptable' for the UK to threaten to unilaterally suspend parts of the protocol. Britain has been preparing legislation that would unilaterally override parts of the protocol - which the EU has warned would result in the suspension of the entire Brexit deal. During the call, Truss also made clear the UK's 'overriding priority' was to protect peace and stability in Northern Ireland. She told Sefcovic the protocol had become 'the greatest obstacle' to forming a new NI executive. After last week's elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the DUP has refused to enter into a new power sharing administration with Sinn Fein unless there are significant changes to the protocol which governs post-Brexit trading arrangements. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: 'The Foreign Secretary outlined that the UK's overriding priority is to protect peace and stability in Northern Ireland and said that the Northern Ireland Protocol had become the greatest obstacle to forming a Northern Ireland Executive.  'She also noted that the current situation was causing unacceptable disruption to trade and had created a two-tier system where people in Northern Ireland weren't being treated the same as everyone else in the UK. 'She reminded Vice President Sefcovic of the importance of defending the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement, and said that the commission bore a responsibility to show more pragmatism and ensure the protocol delivered on its original objectives.' Sefcovic said: 'It continues to be of serious concern that the UK government intends to embark on the path of unilateral action. 'I am convinced that only joint solutions will work. Unilateral action, effectively disapplying an international agreement such as the protocol, is simply not acceptable.' ",

The British actor plays Charlie Spring in Hearstopper, which has proved hugely popular since its debut on the streaming platform last month. While Netflix is yet to confirm whether the hit teen drama will get a follow-up season, its huge viewership would certainly suggest there could be one in the pipeline, with Joe now sharing what he would want to explore in the next chapter. 'I'm excited for [Charlie and Nick],' Joe told British GQ. If we get another season (fingers crossed), I'm looking forward to seeing how they develop as a couple.' He continued: 'In the next graphic novel, Charlie struggles with his mental health and I'd love to explore that more. 'I think a lot of mental health and eating disorder shows tackle mental health in a way that is hard-hitting and really dark, but I'd love to come at these issues from a lighter place.' Meanwhile, in another interview with Variety, Joe also shared his casting hopes for the next instalment of Heartstopper.  'Jennifer Coolidge should play my grandmother,' he said. 'That would be so cool. I love her. She's amazing. 'I also want a scene with Nick's mum so I can work with Olivia Colman.' Heartstopper is available to stream on Netflix now.",
    "5eecdac0b0fdc0473aa4bd2fd03aaa3a2dc16202c486d57fa5761b06": "Tory MP Lee Anderson has doubled down on his controversial comments that people use food banks because they can't 'cook or budget'. The Conservative for Ashfield triggered an online outcry after he made a speech in the Commons on Wednesday saying a large portion of food bank users simply need to taught these basic skills - despite the crippling cost of living crisis which means millions are skipping meals. On Thursday morning, he defended his claims and told Times Radio that a lot of people out there would be able to stop using food banks with the 'right support and the right education'. He added: 'The point I was trying to make was I think the actual food bank use is exaggerated.' Anderson said he works with a local food bank in Ashfield and they've got a 'wonderful initiative' where people receive one food package but have to sign up to a cooking course along with a budgeting course at the same time. The MP also claimed that he was able to make 170 meals for PS50 by cooking from scratch, using fresh vegetables and meat from the local supermarket while batch cooking. He said this would feed a family of five for a week and a half - suggesting the 'real nub of the problem' is the 'generations of people out there who simply haven't got the skills to 'budget properly'. Referring to the backlash from his remarks in the Commons, he said: 'I'm sort of glad it caused all this fuss because it brings that debate out.' He then claimed he had invited all Labour MPs to join part in these courses and 'as yet not one has accepted'. Anderson said until people had attempted the cooking course in Ashfield, 'you've got no right to comment' on his remarks. 'This not me being a nasty Tory,' Anderson claimed. The MP did then clarify: 'There's always genuine people, Stig, in need. I wasn't making that point. 'The point I was making is that there's a lot of people out there who with the right help and the right support and the right education they will be able to fend for themselves.'  However, shadow communities secretary Lisa Nandy suggested Anderson's comments show the Tories are 'living on another planet'. Speaking to Sky News, she said: ''We've got, at the moment, a crisis that is engulfing families and businesses across the country, record inflation - it's not that people aren't budgeting properly, it's that they simply cannot afford the basics. 'And is a damning inditement of 12 years of a Conservative government.' She said there was a food bank in Wigan which was now giving out 'cold boxes' because people can't actually afford to cook the food they're being given. The Labour MP called for significant government intervention to ease the crisis, explaining: 'We've got to get help to people now, we've got to get money back in their pockets, and most of all we have to stop with this sort of patronising rubbish that this is somehow the fault of families who have seen their income drop dramatically in the last few months.'",
    "8d667c1991ee68aed08345dec8610bda1d09e7f7d0c29bcdfde86b62": "Scotland Yard has announced it has issued more than 100 fines for covid lockdown breaches as part of its partygate investigation.  The police had been waiting for the local elections to be over before revealing its latest round of fixed penalty notices for gatherings held in Downing Street and Whitehall during lockdown. Previously, the Metropolitan Police had confirmed that 50 fines had been issued over partygate. In a statement, the Met said: 'As of Thursday 12 May, Operation Hillman, the investigation into breaches of Covid-19 regulations in Whitehall and Downing Street, has made more than 100 referrals for fixed penalty notices (FPNs) to the ACRO Criminal Records Office. 'These referrals have continued to be made throughout the period since our last update on Tuesday 12 April and the investigation remains live.' Boris Johnson is not thought to be among those given one of the additional fines. The prime minister, his wife and chancellor Rishi Sunak have previously received fixed penalty notices for attending a birthday party for the PM in 10 Downing Street. A Downing Street source said: 'If the PM receives a further FPN we will let you know, as we always have.' Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said: 'Boris Johnson stood up in Parliament and said Covid rules were followed in Number 10 at all times. 'Now 100 fines have been issued by the police over partygate. It shows the shocking scale of the law-breaking in Johnson's Downing Street and the extent of his lies.'",
    "f29d3a89fe4031768a6bb5f588df5252882094003ebc4059b1ae5b40": "The Northern Ireland protocol has returned, and yet again, it is threatening the relationship between the UK and the EU. Both sides are locking horns over how to resolve this crisis which could see the whole Brexit agreement torn up and trade war potentially erupting. Here's what you need to know. What is the Northern Ireland protocol? The protocol was proposed as the solution to the Brexit stalemate between the EU and the UK back in 2019. Just months into his time in Downing Street, Boris Johnson signed off on it. It seemed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, therefore avoiding a revival of any past tensions which have cropped between the two countries. But, it means Northern Ireland now, like the Republic of Ireland, has to follow the EU's trade rules so there's no border checks when goods travel around the island of Ireland. As Northern Ireland technically left the EU along with the rest of the UK but still follows EU's single market rules, border checks had to be introduced in the Irish Sea instead. Anything travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland has to be checked as though coming from a third country. Why is everyone talking about it again now? Unionists have repeatedly said that the protocol separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and disrupts trade ever since it was introduced. Their arguments have come to a head after the Northern Ireland Assembly elections, which saw the main unionist party lose their majority for the first time since the Assembly was established. The DUP (Democratic Unionist Party) is currently refusing to nominate someone to be the deputy first minister. The Northern Ireland executive cannot operate without this role. The DUP claim, until the protocol is addressed, it will not only paralyse the executive but the whole assembly. The party could do this by refusing to back the nomination of an assembly speaker on Friday, which would have enabled the legislative body could operate without an executive. What has the UK said? Foreign secretary Liz Truss said on Tuesday night that the government was going to reject the EU's recent suggestions about how to fix the problem. She said: 'The current EU proposals fail to properly address the real issues affecting Northern Ireland and in some cases would take us backward.' The senior minister suggested that the bloc's reforms would see various chilled meats from Britain needing a vet certificate to enter Northern Ireland, and foods outside of the EU no longer available in the country. She explained: 'Our preference has always been for a negotiated solution but will not shy away from taking action to stabilise the situation in Northern Ireland if solutions cannot be found.' What has the UK proposed? The UK could set up new legislation to unilaterally scrap parts of the Brexit agreement signed in 2020, although Brussels says this would be a breach of the UK's obligations. According to The Times, this could mean scrapping checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland, simultaneously ending the EU's Court of Justice role in the country and allow businesses to stop following the bloc's trade regulations. Truss has promoted a new arrangements which would include a green and red division, along with a bespoke data-sharing system, to reduce the trade barriers down the Irish Sea. A Whitehall source told POLITICO's Playbook: 'What is most disappointing here is Brussels truly holds some remarkable brilliant thinkers and yet the negotiations over the past year have shown the EU still clearly misunderstands what is practically happening in Northern Ireland and the structural issues with the protocol.' How has the EU responded? The EU is refusing to back down or renegotiate the protocol. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said: 'The protocol, as a cornerstone of the withdrawal agreement, is an international agreement. Its renegotiation is not an option. The European Union is united in this position.' This was echoed by the German chancellor Olaf Scholz who said: 'No one should unilaterally cancel, break or in any way attack the settlement we have agreed together.'  Ireland's Taoiseach Micheal Martin has also admitted that the protocol issues were 'very serious'. However, Belgian prime minister Alexander De Cross would be happy to cancel the entire Brexit deal, claiming he could not see any 'other solution'. So...What happens next? Truss met Sefcovic on Thursday in a bid to resolve the tensions, but they were not able to find a solution. She told the EU representative that the Commissions bore a responsibility to show more pragmatism and ensure the protocol delivers on its original objectives. According to the Foreign Office's breakdown of their meeting, Sefcovic simply said there was 'no room to expand' the EU negotiating mandate or introduce new proposals to reduce the trade friction - to which Truss replied that as a 'responsible government we would have no choice but to act'.  The foreign secretary is likely to now be considering announcing the radical bill (which would unilaterally scrap parts of the protocol) next Tuesday, even if the EU has not acted by then. Levelling up secretary Michael Gove warned on Wednesday that 'no option is off the table' when it comes to fixing the problems. Meanwhile, the EU is unlikely to renegotiate the protocol to secure the changes the UK is looking for.",
    "1ef8a067bcbd39ec94edd557dc8ef7e8a36da1d9217076fcbfe883e6": "'Check your poo.' These were the characteristically frank words that Deborah James chose to sign off with on the latest episode of You, Me and The Big C, the BBC podcast she has co-hosted for the past four years. In the episode, heartbreakingly titled Deborah James' Last Dance, the presenter and campaigner talked from her parents' garden to friend and producer Mike Holt about her decision to end 'active treatment' for the bowel cancer she's had since 2016. She has now switched to palliative hospice care at home with her family because, in her own words, 'my body simply isn't playing ball'. James, who goes by the name Bowelbabe on social media, also spoke movingly about her co-hosts, Lauren Mahon, now in remission, Rachael Bland, who died of cancer in September 2018, and Rachael's widow, Steve. 'Rach is always in my mind even now,' said James. 'I just don't know how brave she must have been to do what she did because I don't feel that brave. 'I think I am still in awe of how she seemed to take it in her stride. Quite frankly, I'm a quivering mess half the time. But I think if she can do it, I can do it. I'll go and party with her.' On Tuesday, James launched a Bowelbabe fund that has already raised a staggering PS3m for charity as members of the public follow her request to 'buy her a drink' by donating money to future cancer research. But in the final moments of the podcast, she had just two asks to make. 'We'll see each other again, somewhere, somehow, dancing, and until then, please, please enjoy life because it is so precious. l can't tell you. All I want right now is more time and more life,' she said, her voice breaking as she spoke. 'Oh and also, check your poo. I can't leave on any other word apart from check your poo. I still have images of me dancing in poo outfits everywhere. So maybe I should leave on that final word. Check your poo.' Bleeding or blood can be a 'red flag' symptom of bowel cancer, but only a third of people are aware of this, according to the charity Bowel Cancer UK. What are the main symptoms of bowel cancer?  Deborah James is not alone in using her platform to raise awareness of bowel cancer. Newsreader George Alagiah recently discussed how his diagnosis has changed his whole outlook on life, while Radio 1 DJ Adele Roberts has been open about her time out in October 2021 for surgery to remove a tumour. However, recent research by Bowel Cancer UK for Bowel Cancer Awareness Month in April suggested awareness levels aren't where they should be. More than four in 10 people cannot name a single bowel cancer symptom, according to a survey by the charity - with awareness lowest among men. Half of UK men (55%) were unable to spot the signs, compared to 36% of women.  This is Bowel Cancer UK's list of the most common symptoms of bowel cancer, experienced by many who go on to be diagnosed with the disease.    Bleeding from your bottom and/or blood in your poo   A persistent and unexplained change in bowel habit    Unexplained weight loss   Extreme tiredness for no obvious reason   A pain or lump in your tummy    As Bowel Cancer UK stresses, these symptoms don't mean you definitely have cancer, as each of these symptoms can be caused by other health problems. But if you are experiencing one or more or, as the charity says, 'things just don't feel right', you should speak to your GP. If you think you have a blocked bowel, you should also see a doctor straight away or go to your nearest A&E. Don't be embarrassed by bowel issues If you have any of the symptoms listed above, contact your GP 'as early as possible', advises Dr Philippa Kaye, author and a bowel cancer patient herself. 'As both a GP and someone who has had bowel cancer, I completely understand it can be daunting visiting your GP with symptoms. However it is so important that you book an appointment as early as possible - please don't feel embarrassed, don't ignore any symptoms and don't put it off,' says Dr Kaye. 'As GPs we are used to seeing lots of people with bowel problems and if you are worried that something is wrong we want to see you. Early diagnosis could save your life.' In a statement to HuffPost UK, Genevieve Edwards, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, echoes this advice, praising James for her closing podcast message, which she called a 'crucial' reminder. 'Deborah has always worked tirelessly to raise awareness of bowel cancer, and her determination to continue helping others is shining a huge spotlight on bowel cancer and its symptoms,' Edwards says.  'There is no doubt that lives have been saved, and will be saved now and in the future, thanks to the increase in awareness of the disease and its symptoms that Deborah has generated.' She adds: 'Bowel cancer is treatable and curable, especially if diagnosed early.'  So, let's all take a long hard look in the loo - it's what Bowelbabe wants us to do.",

Lucy Shtein and Maria 'Masha' Alyokhina, who are a couple, tricked officers surrounding Shtein's Moscow apartment by donning food delivery worker disguises. They managed to escape the country amid a heightened crackdown on anti-Putin sentiment as the Russian president's invasion of Ukraine falters on. 'It was really convenient that delivery couriers have such big bags. I even managed to put my beloved Mr. Rat in the bag,' Shtein, who left Russia in March, told The Guardian newspaper. Mr. Rat is her pet rat.  'We have become so used to delivery couriers roaming Moscow, so it was a foolproof way to escape,' she added. Alyokjina had initially planned to stay in Russia but followed her girlfriend out of the country last week. They have since reunited in Lithuania. Alyokjina detailed her dangerous escape to CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday, recalling staying at safe houses and her multiple attempts at crossing the Belarus-Lithuania border.

The singer shared a loved up picture showing her and the US sports agent each holding a set of keys outside their new home.  Adele revealed the relationship update in a series of snaps she posted to Instagram on Wednesday that charted her romance with Rich.  'Time flies,' she wrote.  The couple were first publicly linked last year, and were rumoured to be engaged after sporting a ring on her engagement ring at this year's Brit Awards - something she didn't deny during a later interview on The Graham Norton Show. She previously how they first met, saying during her interview with Oprah Winfrey on her US TV special One Night Only: 'I met him at a birthday party, we were on the dance floor. And then we met a couple years later. 'We went out for dinner, which he says was a business meeting and I'm like 'A business meeting about what?' And then it was the first time we hung out on our own.  'Without friends and I think that was a natural way that people would meet each other in real life.' Earlier this month, Adele - who officially finalised her divorce from ex-husband Simon Konecki in March 2021 - said she's 'never been happier' as she shared a thankful message with fans on her 34th birthday. The singer said she had 'so many blessings to be grateful for' as she reflected on the previous 12 months, which also saw her release her long-awaited fourth studio album 30. 'What a difference a year makes!' Adele wrote on Instagram. 'If time keeps healing and smoothing out all the creases in my life like it does as the years fly by, then I can't wait to be 60! 'I've never been happier! So many lessons, so many blessings to be grateful for. 'This is 34, and I love it here! Thank you for the birthday love as always x.' This year will see Adele performing for fans again - five years after she was forced to cancel dates at Wembley Stadium on doctor's orders. She will play two nights at Hyde Park's British Summer Time festival in July, while she is also expected to announce her rescheduled Las Vegas residency. Adele pulled the plug on the US dates at the last minute in January due to the show not being ready. In a Graham Norton interview the following month, she said she is 'working her arse off' to reschedule the dates, and that it will '100% happen this year'.",

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the city to open and attend a memorial, called the Glade of Light, in honour of the victims of the 2017 terrorist attack at Manchester Arena. Twenty-two people were killed by a suicide bomber at an Ariana Grande concert on May 22, 2017, and more than 50 people were seriously injured. An estimated 800 further victims suffered physical and psychological wounds. William spoke about visiting the city just after the attack, saying he remembered 'only too well the shock and grief on the faces of those I met.' 'Five years on, I know that the pain and the trauma felt by many has not gone away,' the duke said. 'As someone who lives with his own grief, I also know that what often matters most to the bereaved is that those we have lost are not forgotten,' he went on, in an apparent reference to his mother, Princess Diana, who died in 1997, when William was 15. 'There is comfort in remembering. In acknowledging that, while taken horribly soon, they lived. They changed our lives. They were loved and they are loved.' 'It is why memorials such as the Glade of Light are so important,' William said. 'Why Catherine and I so wanted to be amongst you today.'  The duke has mentioned his own grief in public remarks before, alluding to his mother's death in a powerful speech against extremism after a terror attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. William and his brother, Prince Harry, unveiled a memorial to their late mother last year, on what would have been her 60th birthday. The statue, created by sculptor Ian Rank-Broadley, occupies a permanent space in Kensington Palace's Sunken Garden. 'Today, on what would have been our Mother's 60 birthday, we remember her love, strength and character -- qualities that made her a force for good around the world, changing countless lives for the better,' the brothers said in a statement at the time. 'Every day, we wish she were still with us,' they continued. 'Our hope is that this statue will be seen forever as a symbol of her life and her legacy.'",

Conservative Lee Anderson told the Commons there was 'not this massive use for food banks'.  'You've got generation after generation who cannot cook properly. They can't cook a meal from scratch. They cannot budget,' he said. Speaking to Sky News on Thursday morning, prisons minister Victoria Atkins said that was 'absolutely not right'. 'This is not the view of me or anyone else in government. We want to give not just immediate help but longer-term support as well,' she said. 'I've spent my ministerial career working with very vulnerable people ... cooking lessons will not be the complete solution to that.' Anderson has defended his comments, arguing they have been misinterpreted.  'I did not say poor people cannot cook or there is no need for food banks. I said there is not the need currently being parrotted out by the MSM [mainstream media],' he wrote on Facebook. 'Today I challenged the whole Parliamentary Labour Party to come to Ashfield to visit the food bank I work with. The give food parcels away on the condition the enrole for cooking and budgeting lessons.' Labour branded Anderson's remarks 'beyond belief', the Lib Dems described them as 'disgraceful' and the SNP said they were 'crass'. The Child Poverty Action Group claimed politicians 'would do better to back real-world solutions, like bringing benefits in line with inflation this autumn'. While the Trussell Trust charity insisted 'cooking meals from scratch won't help families keep the lights on or put food on the table, if they don't have enough money in their pockets'. ",
    "1a090d2453a60841e0967dffaf3b59c599dfb594574855df54b5fb81": "Boris Johnson stumbled when asked how high the energy price cap is as millions struggle with their household bills. The prime minister failed to answer the question when asked by LBC's Nick Ferrari whether he was 'out of touch'. Johnson - who has two young children with his wife Carrie - also refused to answer when asked how much a pack of nappies cost from Boots. The PM is under increasing pressure to offer more help to those struggling with the cost of living after the Queen's Speech was criticised for offering no new support. Speaking to Johnson on a flight back from Helsinki, Finland, Ferrari asked: 'You stand accused of running an administration that's out of touch with the common man or woman. 'You have a supremely rich chancellor of the exchequer with a non-dom wife who doesn't know how to put petrol in his own car. 'Can you tell me you are in touch with people?' Ferrari asked the PM how much he thought 24 Pampers nappies cost at Boots. Johnson replied: 'I'm not going to get into...what I can tell you is that we will do everything we can to help people through a difficult time.' After refusing to answer whether he economised in the current climate, Ferrari then moved on to the energy price cap. 'What's the value of the price cap currently?' he asked. 'I'm not going to get into that.' 'Do you not know that prime minister?' Ferrari continued. Johnson replied: 'What we will do is make sure that we help people afford their weekly outgoings and the best way to deal with the energy price cap...is to make sure that we are not only helping people in the short term, it's helping people immediately.' Ferrari interrupted: 'It's PS1,971, just to help you out.' The prime minister set hares running when he said during the Queen's Speech debate on Tuesday that the chancellor would say more on the matter 'in the days to come'. However, the Treasury appeared blindsided by the move, with one Sunak ally telling HuffPost UK there were 'no announcements as far as we are aware'. Meanwhile, Lee Anderson, the Tory MP for Ashfield, has been criticised after he claimed people used food banks because they cannot 'cook a meal from scratch' or budget. His comments were immediately criticised as out of touch by Labour and MPs from other parties. Tory minister Victoria Atkins also condemned the comments this morning, saying Anderson's view was 'not the view of me or anyone else in government'. Energy bills have spiralled since the sector's regulator, Ofgem, raised the price cap in April. The government is under pressure to bring in measures that would provide immediate relief to struggling families, including a windfall tax on the profits on energy giants. In his LBC interview, Johnson repeatedly refused to rule out bringing in a windfall tax but he also said: 'I don't like them. I didn't think they're the right thing. 'I don't think they're the right way forward. I want those companies to make big, big investments.'",
    "8307ad3f32036c34ae6ae3972f2b6decad782f5bc2bcc631c9571662": "Sweden is still weighing up the prospect of Nato membership while its neighbour Finland has already announced it is firmly in favour of joining in the face of Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine and its ongoing military aggression. Joining the US-led military alliance would mark a radical break in the policy of both north east European countries, underlining once again how Vladamir Putin's aggression has reshaped the post-Cold War order.  On Wednesday, British prime minister Boris Johnson toured both countries and formalised bilateral security agreements during a whirlwind 24 hours. Johnson said his government would give the countries 'whatever is requested' as part of the new pact. Here are some of the issues that have led to the Nordic rethink about entering the 30-nation alliance.  What is Nato?   The military alliance goes by the acronym of Nato.   The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was formed in 1949 to prevent a resurgence of nationalism and militarism in Europe after two world wars, and to deter the Soviet Union's expansion.   Its membership has swelled to 30 member nations, and over the 1990s and 2000s its enlargement stretched further east to include the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.   They agree to mutual defence - military action - in response to an enemy attack. The principle goes: 'An attack against one ally is considered as an attack against all allies.' This is Article 5 of the Nato constitution.    Ukraine is not a member of Nato, which is the main reason why the Western support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy has fallen short of putting their troops on the ground. Ukraine's admission to Nato has been a stated goal going back to its constitution in 2002, but Ukraine's president has accepted his country can't join at present. Nato's enlargement has been Putin's biggest publicly-stated grievance with the West during the build-up up to war, claiming the eastward expansion and potentially sweeping up the largest other former Soviet republic breaks promises. Adding Sweden and Finland is likely to trigger Putin's ire too. Moscow has warned it could deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad - sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania - if they do. Nato has been adamant it will not accept limits on the nations that it admits and has always maintained an 'open door policy'. What is Finland and Sweden's position?    Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed Finland and Sweden to the verge of applying for Nato membership, a move that would end staunch military neutrality for the two European nations. Finland, which shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia, announced on Thursday that they're in favour of apply ing for Nato membership. In a joint statement, the country's president Sauli Niinisto and prime minister Sanna Marin pointed out that 'Nato membership would strengthen Finland's security'. They added that they would apply 'without delay' in the next few days, although a few steps remain before the country can become an official part of the alliance. Neighbouring Sweden is expected to announce its decision in the coming days. Any applications will usher in a tense wait during the months it takes to be ratified by all Nato members, though the alliance and the White House have said they were confident any security concerns could be addressed in the interim. Both countries have been non-aligned militarily since the Second World War, but have been edging towards their current position in response to an increasingly belligerent Russia.  Finland and Sweden switched from formal neutrality to military non-alignment in 1995 when they joined the European Union, and both have drawn closer to Nato in recent years, exchanging intelligence and participating in alliance exercises.  What is 'Finlandisation'? Finland gained independence from Russia in 1917 and fought two wars against it during the Second World War, where it lost some territory to Moscow. Finland signed an Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with Russia in 1948, cementing a degree of economic and political dependency and isolating it militarily from western Europe. The strict policy of neutrality is referred to as 'Finlandisation'.  The end of the Cold War, bringing a break-up of the Soviet Union, allowed Finland to step out of Russia's shadow as the threat from Moscow diminished. It has relied on its own military deterrence and friendly relations with Moscow to keep the peace. But with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, perceptions of relations with Russia as 'friendly' have been undermined. Opinion polls show support for membership in Finland is high, with people mindful of the long land border it shares with Russia. Support in parliament for an application is also broad. Sweden's post-Cold War cuts Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years and post-war foreign policy has focused on supporting democracy internationally, multilateral dialogue and nuclear disarmament. It ran down its military after the Cold War, cutting defence spending of up to four percent of its GDP to about one percent during the 1990s and early 2000s. Despite Putin's offensive, many on the left in Sweden remain suspicious of the US security agenda and Nato, which ultimately relies on the deterrence provided by America's nuclear arsenal. Polls show a substantial majority of Swedes back joining Nato, with support running just above 60% in the latest poll, and there is a majority in parliament in support of an application. When could they join? Finland has a Nato 'option', a kind of a plan of action that mandates applying if the security situation deteriorates, while Sweden's parliament will present a new security policy review on Friday, though the latter is not expected to contain an explicit recommendation concerning Nato. Sweden's ruling Social Democrats have called a parliamentary debate over Nato for Monday. Should the party as expected back joining, the government could call a vote about sending through an application, but it is not formally required to.",

After Selena posted a look at her skin care routine on TikTok earlier this week, some fans accused her of subtly mocking a video that Hailey had posted just hours earlier. Hailey, who married Selena's ex Justin Bieber in 2018, shared a 'get ready with me' video to TikTok showing fans her beauty routine. Later, Selena posted a video of her own, showcasing her skin care routine to Fleetwood Mac's Dreams. Selena - whose 2019 song Lose You To Love Me was widely thought to be about Justin Bieber - took to her comments section to clear the air about the misunderstanding.  'This is why I believe in taking care of your mental health. Guys no idea what I did but I really am sorry. Zero bad intention. Deleting soon,' Selena commented on her video, as seen in a screenshot from a fan. Still, some fans continued to speculate about possible tension between Selena and Hailey, given the timing of Selena's video. 'LOL I know who she's referring to,' one commenter wrote on Selena's TikTok video. 'Wait ... is she tryna make fun of you know who,' another commenter wrote. The Wizards of Waverly Place leading lady later turned off comments on the video. Selena said goodbye to her on-and-off relationship with Justin months before he wedded Hailey. The couple have been married since 2018. Over the years, fans have theorised that Selena and Hailey Bieber hold resentment toward each other, but the two women have always denied the rumours. Last month, Hailey addressed the issue in a TikTok, pleading with trolls to finally let the drama end.  'Leave me alone at this point,' she said. 'I'm minding my business. I don't do anything, I don't say anything. Leave me alone, please. Enough time has gone by where it's valid to leave me alone. I beg of you, truly. That's my only request.' 'Be miserable somewhere else, please,' she added.",

The Gossip Girl star participated in Vogue's Life in Looks video series Monday, in which stars take a walk down fashion-memory lane by reminiscing about some of the most stylish looks they've worn throughout their careers. During the video, Blake got especially excited while discussing the Versace gown and Lorraine Schwartz crown she wore to the 2018 Met Gala, and describes it to the magazine as 'without a doubt my favourite look of all time.'  But she was also quick to point out that her three young daughters -- James, 7, Inez, 5, and Betty, 2 -- that she shares with Ryan Reynolds don't exactly share the same opinion. 'It's something that when my kids are giving me attitude, I'm like, 'This is your mom,' I mean, come on!' Blake said, gesturing to a photo of herself in the stunning dress. 'I try to tell them that I'm real-life royalty and that they're lucky that I'm raising them.' Blake then began laughing, and self-deprecatingly added, 'They don't buy it. They don't believe it.' Maybe her kids need a stronger visual representation of how their mum tends to wear jaw-dropping pieces. May we suggest she show her kids the transformative gown she wore to the 2022 Met Gala -- ya know, the one that made her husband react like this?",

    "1bd7031518ea976ffabd22b58b8c49846023d3a9a23dc237c086ef77": "Keir Starmer's office has been accused of blocking a pro-Jeremy Corbyn councillor from becoming Labour's candidate in the Wakefield by-election, reigniting divisions in the party. Wakefield deputy council leader Jack Hemingway was one of a number of candidates vying to become the city's next MP following the conviction of Tory Imran Ahmad Khan for child sexual abuse. The by-election is seen as a must-win for Labour, given the circumstances surrounding the contest and the opportunity it provides for the party to claim it is winning back its former heartlands. But in a surprise move, Hemingway has been left off the longlist of candidates being considered. HuffPost UK understands the Leader of the Opposition's Office (Loto) was concerned about some of Hemingway's social media posts. A Labour source said: 'We don't block candidates for no good reason -- they must be thinking of the last leadership.' In one deleted post from July 2018, Hemingway said adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism would be a 'disastrous move'. In another post, Hemingway called for Corbyn to be reinstated as a party member after he was suspended over his response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report into anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. The EHRC found evidence of unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination while Corbyn was leader.  In response to the report, Corbyn said allegations about anti-Jewish racism on his watch had been 'dramatically overstated' by his political opponents. Corbyn was reinstated as a Labour member in November 2020 but he still does not have the party whip, meaning he sits as an independent MP. Hemingway told HuffPost UK: 'I'm a committed anti-racist and I think anti-Semitism is a scourge that should be eradicated. 'I've never hid the fact that I supported Jeremy Corbyn for leader and I voted for Rebecca Long-Bailey to be deputy...but I have always respected Keir's right to lead the party.' Hemingway also pointed out that as soon as the EHRC report was published he called for the party to adopt the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism in full. HuffPost UK understands that Loto wants either Kate Dearden, who works for the Community union, or Simon Lightwood, a former staffer for ex-Wakefield MP Mary Creagh, to be the party's by-election candidate. Both are known to have supported Remain in the EU referendum, which some local sources say may be a disadvantage in a seat that voted to leave the EU by 66.3 per cent. When Dearden confirmed via Twitter that she was standing in the by-election, her post was retweeted by Deborah Mattinson, Starmer's director of strategy. The retweet was later undone. Other candidates who have confirmed they want to stand for Labour in Wakefield include Sam Howarth, who used to work for Starmer's ex-political secretary Jenny Chapman, and who now works for Dan Jarvis MP. Wakefield councillor Michael Graham has also confirmed he is seeking the Labour nomination, as is law student Jakob Williamson. One Labour insider told HuffPost UK: 'Loto have seen Jack's tweets and they are not happy. 'They are going to put it down to two names: Kate and Simon. And they are going to keep Jack off.' A local source said: 'The most important thing is that we have a candidate that can withstand a by-election. 'You've got to have a candidate that is fireproof. 'Keir Starmer simply cannot afford to lose this -- end of. He's got to win, and he's got to be very, very careful that he gets the right candidate. 'Keir is trying to put out a particular image and he cannot afford to take any risks.' A Labour source with knowledge of the region said there was a perception within the local constituency Labour party (CLP) that the candidate shortlist would be a stitch-up. 'The CLP are convinced that their local choices are going to be blocked,' they said. 'It's pretty clear that the leaders' office want Dearden, and a screen grab of Deborah Mattinson retweeting her launch has spread like wild fire as proof of that. 'Locally there's a feeling that the higher ups have made their mind up of who is acceptable and who isn't. 'Everyone is really worried that it'll be a shortlist of non local people foisted on us so we have to choose the lesser of the evils not who we really want.  'Kate is not from Wakefield and doesn't know the membership. There's going to be a big push back against anyone seen as being parachuted in. 'It's not the sort of place that will take kindly to it.' A local party member added: 'The CLP have made it clear they want someone who has a genuine connection to the area and not someone who has been flown in.' The NEC drew up its longlist on Wednesday, with shortlisting and interviews taking place on Thursday. Hustings will be held on Sunday May 15, when local members will choose the candidate. A Labour Party spokesperson said: 'Working people in Wakefield have been badly let down by Boris Johnson's Conservatives, who ignored serious allegations of child sexual assault against their paedophile former MP Imran Ahmad Khan before his election. 'Wakefield deserves better and our selection process is now underway. 'Party members in the constituency will consider a shortlist in the coming days and be able to choose the Labour candidate to be Wakefield's new MP.' Labour lost Wakefield to the Tories by 3,358 votes at the 2019 general election after holding the seat since 1932. Imrad Ahmad Khan tendered his resignation on May 3, three weeks after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. A date for the by-election has yet to be announced. ",

You can submit a question here.  When you're first dating someone everything feels so exciting. From speaking to them every day, going on dates and feeling butterflies when you see them, it feels like you're on cloud 9. But sometimes in this honeymoon phase we can get so caught up with the romance, it can blind us from our actual feelings. Do we actually like our new found lover or do we just like the attention they give us? This week's reader Carol writes in asking: 'How do I know if I like someone or like the attention they're giving me? I've started dating someone and we have fun together, but I'm not sure if I like him or like the attention.' How do we know when we like someone?  Counselling Directory Claire Elmes says 'when we like someone everything feels more exciting and positive'.  'You may start to notice your thoughts and feelings change to be centred around them such as starting to like the same things, or missing them when they aren't around,' she says.  'Our bodies have physiological changes when we like someone and we release dopamine and norepinephrine which can make us feel excited and energetic and almost euphoric. Oxytocin levels also increase which boost attachment and safety feelings and can also make us feel a bit uneasy if relationships have been difficult in the past.' How do we know when we only like the attention someone is giving us?  Elmes advises watching out for these signs:    You may not be interested with them as a person, and find it difficult to get to know them on a deeper level.    You may get lonely easily when they're not around.   It can be hard to know whether we like a person or if we just like the attention they are giving us, especially as all of us like to feel special and so if we get positive attention from someone we are likely to respond with positive emotions.    Do you tell others about the other person? Sometimes if we just enjoy the attention that a person gives us we won't find them exciting to speak about and therefore don't tell our friends and family about them.    How can we tell someone that we don't have feelings for them without hurting them? 'Communicate with the other person in a warm and kind way, express that you currently don't have feelings for the individual in a clear but warm way,' says Elmes. 'Don't ignore them - it's important to confront the issue and give an explanation that you do not have feelings for someone rather than ignore them. Being ignored can be hurtful for the individual, and is often the least effective way to let someone know you don't have feelings for them.' If you are confident in your decision and your feelings, Elmes says it's important not to give the person false hope by putting the decision off (while you soak up that attention).  If you only like hanging out with someone for the attention - but can't see a future with them - it's not fair on the other person.  'This may lead to them having hopes for the future, and eventually getting let down and hurt when this doesn't happen,' says Elmes.  'It is also useful to remember that feelings grow over time so if you are not sure it might be useful to explore this with the person. Sometimes love grows and depending on the past relationships of both parties it might be that you get to know each other first.'  Love Stuck is for those who've hit a romantic wall, whether you're single or have been coupled up for decades.

    "9e6b401a82f4526be0a4ecea5b3ea51f80cd2f59122de4c3b000b7b1": "Since finishing in second place at Eurovision in 2019, it's safe to say that Italian singer Mahmood's star has only continued to rise. Not only has his track Soldi swiftly become a modern-day classic of the competition, held up by the BBC and Eurovision icon Mans Zelmermow as one of the best entries of all time, Mahmood also achieved huge highs in his career. He has broken streaming records in his home country of Italy, and just last week performed a sold out show at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire where he was given a welcome usually reserved for the likes of Harry Styles or Shawn Mendes. This year, he's returning to the competition alongside fellow Italian singer Blanco with their theatrical ballad Brividi. Since the pair's duet won the Italian selection show (the Sanremo Music Festival) in February, the track has reached number one in multiple countries, racked up 50 million views on YouTube and even landed among the top five most listened-to songs on Spotify worldwide. Not bad, considering Mahmood wasn't even sure whether to enter the song at Sanremo at all. 'It took me seven days to decide,' he admits to HuffPost UK, recalling Blanco's initial text message suggesting they take Brividi to the national competition. 'I'd already done Sanremo, and already won. So, I thought, 'is it better to be left with a good memory, or do we want to take a risk and try it again?'. Finally, I said that in life, if you don't take a risk, you are already dead. So I said, 'OK, let's go again to Sanremo'.' Now gearing up to return to the Eurovision stage, this time on his home soil, Mahmood's song with Blanco has been among the bookies' favourites for the win since its debut. Here's what he had to tell us ahead of this year's competition.... Were you always a fan of Eurovision, and how has your opinion of it changed over time? In reality, Italy hasn't always been a part of Eurovision. So, in Italy, the Sanremo Music Festival is much more visible, and Italian people are really attached to that. But Eurovision has become more famous in our country since around four or five years ago. And now Eurovision in Italy is really big. Do you have a favourite memory of being part of Eurovision? After the final in 2019, there were great parties. And I remember someone gave me a cocktail with my face on it - so that was really, really incredible, like a movie. No, that's the funny [answer]. The emotional [answer] is being in Tel Aviv for the first time, seeing a new country for the first time. I remember the people working for Eurovision were so professional, so precise. I'd never seen anything like that before in Italy. What are your all-time three favourite Eurovision songs? In 2011, Raphael Gualazzi went to Eurovision with Follia D'Amore. I loved that song, and he actually came in second place too! It was a little bit jazzy, and I love jazz. In Italy, it's not so popular, so when Rapahel Gualazzi represented with a pop-jazzy song, for me, he felt like a kind of innovator. And I remember in Tel Aviv, I was in a disco club, and everybody was dancing,. At one point they played Fuego by Eleni Foureira, and it was massive! People went crazy, and so I remember dancing like crazy to that. And maybe Waterloo by ABBA is another favourite, too. I really like that one. Why is Eurovision still so important? It's so important because it represents music from all over Europe. It's one of the biggest shows outside of America, you know? And also for people like French singers, Spanish singers or Italian singers, it's a huge platform to show a different type of music. For example, a lot of the songs this year are all in different styles. In Italy, music is so different to other countries, so it's important for Eurovision to show the different styles of other countries to all of Europe. Are you feeling any pressure ahead of competing at Eurovision, particularly as you did so well the first time around? No, we don't think about it. The only pressure that I have in this moment is that all the things that will go into the performance have to be perfect. Because it's not going to be a simple stage, you know? It's a huge stage. And to make sure it's a great performance, we have to check everything. We want to do the song justice. I'm zero competitive. I'm really competitive [when it comes to my own] music, you know, I want to do good music and do a great performance. But for me, competition [with others] in music is not a good thing. Because in a competition, where is art? Really, my biggest goal will be to do a great performance on stage. The rest is not important for me. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. We'll be publishing an interview with a new Eurovision legend every day leading up to this year's live final on Saturday 14 May. Come back tomorrow when we'll be speaking to this year's UK hopeful Sam Ryder. Watch the music video for Mahmood and Blanco's Brividi below:",

Host Fiona Bruce announced at the end of last week's programme that the outspoken German driver would be on the next panel in Hackney, London.  But there was a wave of excitement on social media when Question Time's Twitter feed paraded this week's guests ahead of Thursday's broadcast. Vettel has voiced his opinions on various political topics over the years, notably the environment and LGBT+ rights. Earlier this month he turned up at the Miami Grand Prix wearing a T-shirt suggesting it would be the first Formula 1 race to take place underwater thanks to climate change. When asked why he was appearing on QT, Vettel said it was a 'different format' and there will probably be 'different sorts of questions or topics to be spoken about'. It's unclear whether Vettel has actually seen the, at times, free-wheeling show that has given a platform to a philosophy graduate to 'vaxx-plain' to a vaccines expert, seen an audience member kicked off, and brought the 'passionate Highlander' to prominence. It was perhaps the prospect of a delicious encounter between a sporting great and the unpredictable British public that led to the online reaction. ",

Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Lee Anderson, the MP for Ashfield, invited other MPs to come to a food bank in his constituency. 'When people come now for a food parcel they have to register for a budgeting course and a cooking course,' he said. 'What we do at a food bank is we show them how to cook cheap and nutritious meals on a budget. We can make a meal for about 30p a day. He added: 'There's not this massive use for food banks in this country.' 'You've got generation after generation who cannot cook properly. They can't cook a meal from scratch. They cannot budget.' But he was immediately criticised for the comments. The SNP's Joanna Cherry said MPs were 'perfectly well aware of the requirement' for food banks across the country. 'The requirement for them is not because people don't know how to cook,' she said. 'It's because we have poverty in this country at a scale which should shame his government.' Figures released last month showed the Trussell Trust charity provided more than 2.1 million food parcels to people facing financial hardship across the country, from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 Earlier, a Tory council leader faced intense online backlash after he was pictured smiling and laughing while ceremoniously opening a food bank.",

The prime minister said the government would give the country 'whatever is requested' as part of a new security agreement. The deal, which Johnson signed with Swedish PM Magdalena Andersson today, says: 'Should either country suffer a disaster or attack, the United Kingdom and Sweden will, upon request from the affected country assist each other in a variety of ways, which may include military means.' It comes in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and moves by Sweden and Finland to join NATO. Asked at a press conference whether the agreement include British troops being deployed to Sweden if the country is attacked by Russia, Johnson said: 'What matters primarily is what Sweden decides to request.' He added: 'In the event of a disaster or an attack on Sweden, the UK would come to the assistance of Sweden with whatever Sweden requested.' Earlier, the PM had said: 'This week, many of us have been paying tribute to the brave men and women who secured victory and peace in Europe 77 years ago. 'So, it's a sad irony that we've been forced to discuss how best to fortify our shared defences against the empty conceit of a 21st century tyrant.' At the same press conference, Johnson said he wanted to 'move on' from the partygate row which has engulfed his leadership. The row was reignited earlier this week when Keir Starmer said he would resign as Labour leader if fined by Durham police over claims he also broke lockdown laws, Asked whether he was acting 'dishonourably' compared to the Labour leader, the PM said: 'We're trying to move beyond all that and trying to focus on the issues that really matter, not least the war in Ukraine.'",
    "0ba8431506f07030308d2ddef6ffc4e54e90c8b21a5c38548a08ce91": "Lorraine Kelly has said she wishes she'd complained about the 'horrible' depiction of her in the sketch comedy series Bo Selecta. Bo Selecta ran between 2002 and 2009 and saw Leigh Francis - also the creator of the character Keith Lemon - impersonating celebrities using exaggerated latex masks and prosthetics. Looking back at the show, Lorraine said she found the impression of her used throughout the series 'really distasteful'. Speaking to the podcast Be Honest, Lorraine said: 'I didn't complain, but I should have.' Admitting that she deliberately swerved watching Bo Selecta, she also voiced her disapproval over Leigh Francis' impression of Craig David, who she said is like 'the son I never had'. 'I was actually very, very upset at the portrayal of Craig David, because I adore Craig,' she explained. 'He's the kindest, loveliest man, and that absolutely derailed his career, there's no question of it. 'Of course, he's a brilliant artist and he got over it but for a few years that did badly affect him and his career.' She continued: 'With me, I just found it really distasteful, really horrible and I should have complained at the time, and I certainly would complain now. 'I think any woman would. The portrayal of everybody was actually very cruel.' In 2020, amid a renewed focus on the Black Lives Matter movement following the murder of George Floyd, Leigh Francis issued a public apology for his portrayal of Black celebrities in Bo Selecta, which included Michael Jackson, Trisha Goddard and Mel B. Alongside an apology video, he wrote: 'Following recent events, I've done a lot of talking and learning and I would like to put this out there. 'I want to apologise to anyone that was offended by Bo Selecta. I'm on a constant journey of knowledge and just wanted to say I'm deeply sorry.' Trisha Goddard later said she had spoken privately to Leigh prior to his apology, telling him: '[Bo Selecta] emboldened a lot of casual racism towards myself and others you parodied with big lips and noses. 'It would be a very powerful gesture for you to recognise what part you played in perpetuating blackface.' The talk show host also said that the impressions, which saw Leigh donning rubber masks to impersonate celebrities, left her feeling 'hurt, distaste and disgust', and that her children were bullied due to the show.",
    "669abb399f76ea57dcbeacddde89d671a117530559cf4a7faf35fcb1": "A Tory council leader has faced intense online backlash after he was pictured smiling and laughing while ceremoniously opening a food bank. Jeremy Kite, the borough council leader for Dartford, was seen in Facebook photos attending the official opening of the borough's new food bank, cutting a ribbon amid a smiling crowd. As the cost of living crisis worsens, and millions admit to skipping meals just to pay the bills, the photos have been accused of being completely tone deaf. The backlash even crept over to LBC radio station, where presenter James O'Brien began to criticise the photo when Kite actually called in on Wednesday morning. He explained: 'I love my town, I love the people in it, I'm trying to do the right thing. 'We were invited yesterday to open - it's not actually a brand new food bank, it's a new location where there's been a lot of work put into it by the volunteers and others. There was actually a bit of a joke just before the ribbon was cut and photographs will tell a snapshot of the moment.' The joke was allegedly about the countdown. Kite also said the opening ceremony was 'thrown by the people who organise and volunteer' in the food bank, who also wanted to put the ribbon in place to honour the occasion. As O'Brien asked Kite 'what the hell' he was thinking, the council leader said as a guest it would have been a 'mistake' to turn down the organisers' photo offer. The pictures were then deleted from the Mayor of Dartford's Facebook page following the outcry, but reposted a few hours later with a caption explaining: 'There have been a number of comments this morning suggesting that the cutting of a ribbon was inappropriate in those circumstances. 'This aspect of the visit was arranged by the organisers and volunteers and took place at their request. The council representatives were pleased to meet so many volunteers, organisers and clients of the food bank and wish it well in its new home.' The comments were limited to the owner of the page, but there were 88 reactions or either the angry or sad face emojis. Here's a roundup of some of the most furious responses on Twitter:",

According to The Times, the government will next week remove the need for checks on all goods being sent from Britain for use in Northern Ireland. The protocol forms part of the Brexit agreement between the UK and the EU.  It means there are no checks on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Scrapping the border checks would put the UK in breach of the treaty and has raised the prospect of a trade war. Belgium's prime minister, Alexander De Croo has warned the EU would take retaliatory measures. 'Don't touch this,' the Daily Telegraph reported him having said. 'If that agreement would be revoked, then I would think the whole system will be revoked. I would not see any other solution.' Maros Sefcovic, the vice-president of the European Commission, said: 'renegotiation is not an option'. Boris Johnson's spokesperson said on Tuesday: 'It remains a very serious situation. 'I think our preference still remains obviously to reach a negotiated solution. But we have been doing this for 16 months. 'We reserve the right to take further actions if solutions can't be found urgently.' They added: 'We are at a position where the proposals put in front of us do not improve things, in fact they are a backwards step.' The protocol was agreed in order to prevent a so-called hard border on the island of Ireland, amid concerns that would lead to return to violence. Instead, goods are checked when they travel from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland. Johnson agreed to this deal in 2019. But since then the government has said the system is not working as the checks are disrupting trade within the UK. Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland are also unhappy that there is a border between the region and the rest of the UK. Sinn Fein, the nationalist party which supports the protocol, emerged from last week's Northern Ireland Assembly elections as the largest party. But the DUP, the largest unionist party, has refused to join the new executive until its problems with the protocol are addressed.",
    "f8b0b75b2378fa343a2cb83b226a1ddffd229b11d98356f1f30cd085": "Downing Street has said the government remains committed to building 300,000 new homes a year, despite Michael Gove suggesting the target had been ditched. The pledge was contained in the Tory manifesto in the run-up to the 2019 general election. It said: 'Since 2010 there has been a considerable increase in homebuilding. We have delivered a million homes in the last five years in England: last year, we delivered the highest number of homes for almost 30 years. 'But it still isn't enough. That is why we will continue our progress towards our target of 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s.' Appearing on Radio 4's Today programme this morning, the levelling up secretary was asked if the government would hit its target. He said: 'We'll do everything we can but it's no kind of success simply to hit a target if the homes that are built are shoddy, in the wrong place, don't have the infrastructure required and are not contributing to beautiful communities. 'Ultimately, when you're building a new dwelling, you're not simply trying to hit a statistical target. I'm certainly not.' Pressed on whether the government was still committed to its manifesto pledge, Gove said: 'We are not bound - I am not bound - by one criterion alone when it comes to development. Arithmetic is important, but so is beauty, so is belonging, so is democracy.' But Downing Street later said the government remained committed to its target. 'Our target to deliver 300,000-a-year is central to our levelling up mission,' the prime minister's spokesperson said. 'We're certainly making progress towards that target. We are at 244,000-a-year currently. 'Some of the measures in this bill are designed to remove some of the barriers that can gum up planning applications and cause more resistance amongst local communities.'",
    "903b14c64231e3377ff0d835ebc3fa18f5bcd48c5741efbeca67be67": "Raw food allergies are on the rise and pose a particular risk to vegans and vegetarians, one of Britain's leading experts has said. Pollen food syndrome (PFS) - also known as oral allergy syndrome - is a hypersensitivity reaction to certain fruits, vegetables and nuts when consumed in their raw form. Cases have increased significantly in the last few years as a result of global heating, worsening pollution and changes in pollen patterns, Dr Isabel Skypala, the only consultant allergy dietician in the NHS, told the Guardian.  Around 13 million Brits who are allergic to pollen - especially birch tree pollen -and suffer from hay fever are considered high risk. PFS is triggered by unstable pollen antibodies found in proteins in some raw fruits and vegetables, nuts and soya. However, it isn't an issue when these ingredients are cooked.  What is raw food allergy? If you are susceptible to allergies you can become sensitised to airborne pollens by breathing them in. This is most commonly seen with hay fever. But many plant-based foods - fruit, vegetables, nuts and cereals - have a protein structure that is very similar to the pollen in trees, grasses and weeds. PFS is hypersensitivity reaction to certain raw fruits, vegetables and nuts which usually causes mild symptoms. But it can also be caused by foods popular among people who tend to avoid animal products, such as soya milk, avocados, jackfruit, edamame beans and smoothies. Other foods that can trigger PFS include raw apples, pears, kiwi fruits, strawberries, plums, cherries, cherry tomatoes, celery and carrot, the Anaphylaxis Campaign said. As well as this, frozen fruit or vegetables and peeling potatoes or other root vegetables can lead to itching or swelling in the hands and eyes. What are the symptoms? Symptoms of PFS usually occur within five to 10 minutes of eating the allergic food. Most people who suffer from PFS will only experience mild symptoms, but more troubling symptoms an include:  Itching Nausea Vomiting Difficulty breathing as their throat swells up  'While a lot of people with PFS are having a mild reaction, severe reactions are more frightening and more dangerous,' Dr Skypala said. 'A PFS reaction, mild or severe, makes people extremely anxious, and they often cut out all fruit and nuts, because they are worried about having another reaction.' According to Allergy UK, you may experience severe reactions if you:   Consume large amount of allergen in a short space of time such as nuts, soya milk, freshly squeezed juice and smoothies     Have allergies to several plant based foods   Have uncontrolled or asthma   Who is most at risk? PFS affects about 2% of the adult population in the UK and is often linked to sensitivity to grass, tree or weed pollen. The people most at risk are those who suffer from hay fever. It's someone's inherent sensitivity to pollen, rather than the fact they follow a meat-free diet, that puts them at risk, Dr Skypala said. Why has there been a rise?  'The rising prevalence of PFS comes at a time when there is a worldwide change in dietary habits, with more people adopting a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle. A vegan/vegetarian diet may also include soy and jackfruit, both of which can provoke severe PFS reactions,' The Anaphylaxis Campaign said. The rise in cases is adding pressure to the NHS. But, specialist services are under-resourced so sufferers might have to wait months to be seen, Skypala said.  However, you should always seek advice from your healthcare professional if you are concerned you may have had an allergic reaction to a plant based food.  ",

The prime minister spoke out as he was quizzed about Keir Starmer's pledge to resign if he is fined over beergate. Johnson has already been handed a fixed penalty notice by the Metropolitan Police for attending his own birthday party in the Cabinet Room in Number 10 in June, 2020. He has repeatedly insisted he will not quit, despite the threat of more fines for other parties being investigated by the police. Asked at a press conference in Sweden whether he was acting 'dishonourably' compared to the Labour leader, the PM said: 'We're trying to move beyond all that and trying to focus on the issues that really matter, not least the war in Ukraine.' The partygate scandal resulted in several Tory MPs publicly calling on Johnson to resign, with even more submitting letters of no confidence in his leadership to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. Durham Constabulary last week announced that they were re-opening their investigation into whether Starmer breached covid guidelines by having curry and beer with colleagues in April last year. In response, the Labour leader said he will resign if the police issue him with a fine. He said: 'If the police decide to issue me with a fixed penalty notice I would of course do the right thing and step down.'

Executive producer Jason Herbison has spoken out about the singer returning as Charlene Robinson alongside Jason Donovan as on-screen husband Scott, as the Australian soap ends after 37 years this summer.  After much speculation, last month it was announced Kylie and Jason would appear in the finale more than three decades after leaving their roles, as a teaser of their scripts was posted on social media.  The soap boss revealed that the pair have already shot their scenes ahead of the show wrapping filming next month, which he described as a 'very moving experience'. Speaking to Inside Soap magazine, he said: 'Both Kylie and Jason needed very little persuading at all - they both appreciate the show and the special role that it has played in their careers. 'It's a lovely show of respect to Neighbours, and I was thrilled when they said yes. It didn't feel right to end the show without them.' Jason said their scene had been written in 'total secrecy', explaining: 'Not even the script department knew it was happening!' He added: 'I was there on the day of filming, and it was a very moving experience and one that will remain with me well beyond the series wrapping in August. I feel very privileged to have been part of it.' Neighbours will air its final episode in both the UK and Australia on 1 August, with a host of other characters from across its 37 years also returning for its send off.  They include actors Ian Smith (Harold Bishop), Peter O'Brien (Shane Ramsay), Mark Little (Joe Mangel), Daniel MacPherson (Joel Samuels) and Natalie Bassingthwaighte (Izzy Hoyland). Jason said in a statement: 'Whether the 80s, 90s, noughties or teens is your favourite decade, we will be delivering something for everyone as Neighbours draws to a close. 'Alongside the current cast we will be celebrating the most memorable characters from across many eras, with a few surprises up our sleeve.' Earlier this year, it was revealed the future of the show was in jeopardy after UK broadcaster Channel 5 announced it would stop airing Neighbours from this summer. After the search for a new UK broadcast partner proved unsuccessful, it was confirmed the show would come to an end altogether, with bosses promising to 'end the show on an incredible high'. Over the years, Neighbours also helped launch the careers of many other Australian stars, including Natalie Imbruglia, Liam Hemsworth and two-time Oscar nominee Margot Robbie.",

The Levelling Up secretary got everyone talking with his appearance on the show on Wednesday morning, attempting a number of bizarre impressions.  As Dan and co-host Sally Nugent quizzed Gove on whether there would be an emergency budget to ease the cost of living crisis, he appeared to impersonate a character from one of Harry Enfield's 90s sketch 'Scousers'.  The senior Conservative politician also appeared to attempt an American accent when he accused pundits of misinterpreting the prime minister's words into 'a major, capital letters, big news story!'

The Homes Under The Hammer presenter's organs started to fail after a sack around his heart filled with fluid, meaning it could not pump properly.  During Wednesday's This Morning, Martin discussed his recent health scare, and explained he had been feeling 'under the weather for a couple of weeks' before being taken to hospital, initially believing he might have been suffering with long Covid.  'I've had a few chest infections over the last few years and I've had asthma since childhood, so I'm used to quite a tight chest,' he told hosts Phillip Schofield and Rochelle Humes. 'As it approached the Easter Bank Holiday weekend, it was starting to get really bad where I could hardly walk without struggling for breath. 'It looked like it could have been the symptoms for long Covid - real lethargy, a tightness in the chest, pain in the chest, difficulty breathing, so you pause it and pause it and by the time it got to just after the Bank Holiday weekend, I was starting to be delirious, putting letters the wrong way round, I said to Kirsty [his wife], 'We've got to go to hospital.'' Martin continued: 'There's a sack around your heart and it was filling with fluid, it's called a pericardial effusion and that in turn is something called a tapenade, which basically means this sack is squeezing the heart it sits around, so the heart isn't able to expand, and therefore isn't able to pump, so it means all of your organs start failing. 'By the time they got to me, my kidneys were at 30 per cent, my liver was at 30 per cent, my lungs weren't getting the oxygen and at any point, I could have had a heart attack... The heart would have been strangled by itself.'  He added: 'We're talking minutes stroke hours of life left here.' Martin said he then had a 'dark red/black liquid' drained from his chest under a local anaesthetic.  His wife Kirsty described his health scare as a 'watershed moment' for them both to readjust their pace of life.  But Martin added he will start filming Homes Under the Hammer again in a few weeks.

    "ea7d95dd8a549825eb021d3096df92881946eb7f35b55f334c8915d7": "The government did not lay out any feasible plan to address the cost of living crisis in the Queen's Speech on Tuesday - even though, according to experts, it still has the means to do so. Prime minister Boris Johnson did suggest he would act on the crisis soon, telling the Commons he and Rishi Sunak will be 'saying more about this in the days to come'. However, levelling up secretary Michael Gove and Treasury officials have rejected the idea that this could mean an emergency budget is on its way. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility - the official independent forecaster - there is approximately PS20 billion left for the Treasury to help out with the general public's finances without causing too much trouble further down the line. But the Treasury has chosen not to use it. So here are nine ways the government could spend that money to alleviate the current crisis: 1. Uplifting Universal Credit by PS25 a week This would cost the government PS1.35 billion to do this for six months, between May and October, according to calculations from National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). Another think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), echoed this idea and proposed an increase in universal credit and legacy benefits of 8.1%, along with increasing child benefit by PS10 per week, per individual. This would cost PS1.5 billion more than Sunak's Spring Statement but would keep the crisis impact on the poorest people below PS200. Economist at King's College London and former Treasury official, Jeevun Sandher, also suggested that bringing back universal credit uplift would cost PS6 billion - which is less than 1% of GDP. He told The Big Issue: 'There is only one reliable way to help families who can't make ends meet. And that is with cold, hard cash.' 2. One-off cash payment of PS250 for energy bills This would go towards the 11.3 million households in the bottom half of the income distribution, and would cost PS2.85 billion, according to the NIESR. When Ofgem - the energy regulator - lifted the price cap at the beginning of April on energy bills, the cost of living crisis really kicked in. The annual energy bill for the average household rose by PS700 (54%) for England, Wales and Scotland. It means consumers will end up paying closer to PS1,971 on average for their yearly gas and electricity bills, potentially pushing almost six million people into fuel poverty. 3. One-off windfall tax on oil and gas Labour claim this would cut household bills up to PS600 and help support businesses through this trying time. A windfall tax targets the excess profits a company, or group of companies, did not expect to make. Here, it means oil and gas firms earning more as energy prices surge around the world due to the war in Ukraine would have to hand it over to the government. IPPR also backs this measure, while calling for more investment into renewable power and for the government to fully endorse onshore wind power. At the moment, the UK is vulnerable to the staggered progress on renewables, energy efficiency and energy storage. However, Johnson has already dismissed the idea of a windfall tax, claiming increasing taxes would 'stop investment' by oil and gas companies in the UK. 4. Emergency budget Labour and the Liberal Democrats have pushed for the government to roll out an emergency budget. Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: 'Millions of families and pensioners are struggling to get by. They need more help now before things get even worse in the autumn.' She added: 'An emergency budget is needed now to cut taxes for ordinary families while taxing the super profits of oil and gas companies.' According to The Independent, Derek Lickorish, former chair of the government's fuel poverty advisory group, also suggested that between eight and 10 million households need an extra PS1,000 each to 'get them through this very, very difficult period'. He estimated that this would cost between PS8 and PS10 million, explaining: 'Repayment of this sum is impossible for these consumers -- it has to be a grant. These are exceptional circumstances. It's going to have to go on the government's credit card.' 5. Scrapping the national insurance rise  The hike in national insurance contributions has significantly added to the stress of the cost of living when it kicked in on April 6. It meant workers had to pay more towards national insurance, as their tax climbed up from 1.25 percentage points from 12% to 13.25%. Labour's Jonathan Reynolds said: 'The Conservatives' decision to hike taxes during a cost of living crisis will make things even harder for businesses and families.' The majority of the rise will be covered by key sectors such as manufacturing, while employers in the health and social care sector will face an extra PS1billion in tax. Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'The small business tax burden is now at its greatest since the 1950s.' Labour suggests that one-off windfall tax on profits instead of the national insurance increase would help the smaller firms who are more vulnerable. 6. Tackling insulation costs IPPR has suggested the warm homes discount - one-off discount to your electricity bill for people on low incomes or those relying on pension credit - could be increased from PS140 to PS540. This would help the 8.5 million households who are currently on the scheme. In the long-term, the government could introduce PS18 billion investment for home insulation and low carbon heating to cut the country's energy bills. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas has suggested a street-by-street home insulation programme would be more efficient, while also addressing the pressing climate crisis. 7. Addressing food accessibility The yearly amount we spend on groceries is expected to rise by an average of PS271, according to data analytics company Kantar. To tackle this and prevent the rising levels of poverty, the government could cut tariffs on food which can't be produced in Britain and has to be imported, like rice. Local authorities have also called for the government to push a 'cash first approach' to food insecurity, a technique also recommended by the Independent Food Aid Network. Promoting a cash first approach would allow local authorities to provide direct, easy accessible cash payments to people struggling with the financial crisis, along with pushing for systemic changes which would increase social security payments and wages to mach the cost of living. Is the Treasury already helping? The government has announced a few measures to assist with the crisis, including a tax cut of more than PS330 a year for the typical employee. It has also lowered the Universal Credit taper rate to help people keep more of the money they earn and offered PS350 to millions of households to assist with the energy bills. There's tax-free childcare for about PS2,000 a year and pension credit, is worth around PS3,300 a year, but critics believe none of these measures go far enough when it comes to alleviate the looming financial crisis. Gove did hint that benefits could go up on Wednesday, saying Sunak and the work and pensions secretary Therese Coffey are 'looking hard' at what they can do, but the government is yet to make an announcement in this sector. What will happen if the government doesn't do more? Economic growth is expected to slow significantly, while 1.5 million households could end up struggling to pay food and energy bills in the next 12 months. The UK would be pushed into a recession - meaning two consecutive quarters where the economy shrinks - while inflation is already at a 30-year high. The Bank of England has even cautioned that inflation could rise 10% in the coming months and households would have even less disposable income. 'Without this targeted support, we expect a further increase in extreme poverty,' NIESR said, especially with the added squeeze from the Ukraine war. It added that 250,000 households face 'destitution' without immediate support. Tony Danker of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) also told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Downing Street needs to incentivise people to invest now. He suggested the government should cut business rates or subsidise the shift to clean energy, otherwise 'the economy will end up in more trouble'.

The ads used words such as shiitake, pistachio and fettuccine in place of popular phrases.  One of them said 'what a load of shiitake' with an image of a mushroom, while another featured a nut next to the words 'they're taking the pistachio'. A third revealed pasta uncovering the words 'for fettuccine's sake'.  And naturally, 52 people complained. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) declared the images 'were likely to cause serious and widespread offence' and told Tesco to stop using the ads.  Tesco Mobile claimed it didn't actually use any offensive words or images, but agreed to the ban and apologised nevertheless.  But what do you make of it? A draconian response over a bit of fun? Or careless advertising? Whichever camp you are, you might be wondering when swearing became so taboo and how attitudes towards it changed. We spoke to Tony Thorne, a lexicographer and language consultant at King's College London, who tells us we've learned to associate swearing with personality and morals. 'Many Brits still affect to be shocked by bad language because they think it fits an image of respectability,' he tells HuffPost. 'In fact scientists have proved that swearing is therapeutic and most people do it, even if not publicly. 'Lots of brands have tried to use plays on rude words, since FCUK, but younger consumers often find these cringeworthy while older consumers may find them offensive - or obscure if they don't get the reference.' He points to Claudine Davi's Letters from the linguists: the evolution of swearing, which shows that profanity came from blasphemy - against God, against royalty.  Then in the 18th and 19th century, it evolved into a social taboo which elevated its status. Forbidden words had more power to shock and disgust, something that somewhat remains. But now, we have more commonly accepted obscenities that won't cause anyone to cast a second look. Unless they're on a Tesco advert, maybe.",

Or Meghan's hair, to be precise. Serbia's entry, In Corpore Sano (which is Latin for 'healthy body'), performed by Konstrakta, opens with the line: 'What could be the secret of Meghan Markle's healthy hair?'. Well, we all want to know, right? The song continues to address the importance of hydration, and how under-eye circles are supposedly linked to liver distress, obviously. 'The artist is supposed to be healthy. God grant us health,' she sings in the chorus. Ahhh, Eurovision. Never change. Speaking about the lyrical reference to Meghan, Konstrakta said: 'Meghan Markle isn't that important here, but she's representative of all those people in the media that we're focused on. 'She hasn't contacted me yet, but I'd like for her to hear it. This is a song about the atmosphere in which we're living, which has put health as the highest value.' The singer has also been quoted as saying: 'Meghan is also exiled, and we support exiled people.'

    "5e65ed781d40f1215498fe9eec78e2044c3007665d531a5b2baa4610": "Because of our... hmmmm... let's just say complicated relationship with Eurovision in the UK, we as a nation sometimes have a tendency to toss our competing acts aside pretty swiftly after the contest is over. One definite exception to this would be SuRie, who competed with her song Storm in 2018, and has remained close to British fans' hearts ever since, appearing at a string of official Eurovision gigs and fan events alike in the past four years. 'I feel so lucky because [representing the UK] has been anything but a poisoned chalice for me,' she tells HuffPost UK as preparations for this year's contest get underway. 'It's been an absolute gift that keeps on giving. 'I don't know I can really answer why, but I'm incredibly grateful for it. We've gone on quite a path together, which is just a thrill. 'We can be a fickle bunch, can't we, as Brits? But I love us for our cynical, self-deprecating attitude as well.' Of course, SuRie does have one theory about her enduring popularity, which relates to why her 2018 performance was so infamous. 'I mean, I had quite a unique moment on the Eurovision stage, so maybe that's had something to do with how much people have taken me under their wing,' she suggests. For those in need of a reminder, SuRie was at the centre of a stage invasion during her performance in 2018, when a man burst onto the stage, stole her microphone and shouted a message 'demanding freedom' from the 'modern Nazis of the UK media'. The man in question was removed from the stage by security, and while a lesser performer might have crumbled in the heat of the moment, a defiant SuRie won praise for her tenacity and persistence, finishing the song with gusto and a visible fire in her. 'It was so surreal that it came back on the lyrics, 'hold your head up, don't give up',' she recalls. 'You can see in my eyes how fired up I was. I mean, I was livid. 'But the empowerment of the last part of the song, plus the incredible reaction from the crowd, that's what I take away from it.' 'I don't wish what happened to me on stage upon anyone,' she quickly adds. 'But that's not the moment I take away. It's the 30 seconds at the end where everyone got behind me and that roar was shared by all.' SuRie has always publicly shown a sense of humour about the incident ('life is tough enough'), but admits this isn't something she's always found easy. 'In the immediate aftermath, it wasn't particularly funny,' she recalls. 'I tried my best to keep my calm and composure on stage, but immediately after, when I was backstage, I wasn't laughing. 'I went through a phase of obsessively watching it. And I'm not saying that was a healthy thing, but that was just part of my brain trying to make sense of the fall-out of what happened on stage. And also I was watching it from different angles, from fans who'd filmed it in the stadium. Even though I very vividly remember what happened, I was there! I don't necessarily need to fill in the gaps! 'I'm fine now, and I was fine quite quickly afterwards. But yes, I do like to keep humour a big part of my life as well. It was my moment, I can't change it, can I? It's what happened. There we go.' Here's what else SuRie had to say when we spoke all things Eurovision with the Storm singer... What's your first memory of watching Eurovision? I was first introduced to Eurovision in 2015. I didn't watch it growing up, which is shameful to admit. So, my first real experience of Eurovision was actually working at it, as a backing singer and dancer for Loic Nottet, representing Belgium with Rhythm Inside. I had the most phenomenal time in Vienna, and I was invited back in 2017 to Kyiv with the Belgian delegation again, this time with Blanche and City Lights. Then I met with the BBC backstage and started working with them as a songwriter. And that led to my 2018 moment. Have you always been a fan of Eurovision, and has your opinion of it changed over time? I was just clueless about it at first. And again, I shamefully admit that because, I have since listened back to the wealth of songwriting gold that there has been over the 60-odd years, and not having those Eurovision parties or moments or nights with my family growing up, I'm sad and kicking myself that I missed out on that. Being there in person, my mind was blown to the beautiful, inclusive celebratory world that Eurovision is. And now I'm hooked. I'm a true convert. What's your favourite memory of being part of Eurovision? I had the most amazing memories twice over with the Belgian delegation, who just treated us so incredibly. But nothing can compare with actually flying the flag for the country that you are very proud of - for all our flaws and all our faults and everything. I suppose [the best memory] is just the rush of adrenaline and the visceral emotional reaction in the few seconds where you take to the stage. The camera light comes on, the little sound in your ear counts you down, nothing will ever compare with that memory. I describe it like white noise. Everything was so calm in that moment, like, 'I am completely in the right place doing exactly the right thing that I should be doing with my life'. And that was a really happy feeling. Who are you rooting for at Eurovision this year? I've listened to them all, and it's a wonderful bunch. There's something for everyone, which is what I love about Eurovision Cornelia's Hold Me Closer [for Sweden] is an absolute earworm of a tune. But for me, Maro for Portugal is my favourite. It just makes my heart sad and happy, with this melancholic yearning mixed with light folk music. It gives me a really really visceral reaction, and I can't argue with that. Compared to everything else, that is the one that gets into my chest, tugs on my heartstrings and reminds me that I'm alive. And there's no better reaction to music than that. I hope it does well. What are your three all-time favourite Eurovision songs? I loved Carl Espen's Silent Storm as a tune even before my Lisbon moment. But after that, the poignancy of those lyrics took on a whole new meaning. That's one of my favourites. Also, I love the quirky ones, like Nocturne by Secret Garden. That an instrumental, cinematic soundscape of a track can win at Eurovision is just amazing. And I know this might feel like a bit of a cop-out, but I have to say Duncan Laurence's Arcade. There can be a strength in stillness and simplicity, and songwriting rising to the top in this theatrical spectacle of a show. Arcade is a beautiful song. Why is Eurovision still so important? I implore anyone to go to one Eurovision Song Contest in their life and soak up the positive inclusive energy that is not just in the arena, or in the shows, but in the whole host city. If we could bottle up some of that positive energy that is unique and indescribable to those that don't know Eurovision, we could solve a lot of the world's problems. Eurovision for world peace, I think.  Would you ever consider going back to Eurovision to compete in the future? I feel lucky to have had a hat-trick of Eurovision memories in different capacities. But, of course I would go again. Nothing would bring me more pleasure, because it is the most incredible show. The difference this time is I would like to have more creative input and have more of a hand in things artistically. So, yes, I would love to go again. I may have tried, and I was maybe told no... But we'll see - things take time. And maybe it's for the best, maybe I need to go away, work on my craft and make sure I've got something really impossible to say no to.  SuRie is currently working on her third studio album. Her latest EP Rye is available on all digital platforms.  This interview has been edited for clarity and length.   We'll be publishing an interview with a different Eurovision legend every day leading up to this year's live final on Saturday 14 May.

The former Grey's Anatomy star is currently appearing in a revival of Take Me Out, a baseball-themed play which centres around themes of sexuality, race and toxic masculinity. Take Me Out also includes scenes of full-frontal nudity, and while audience members are asked not to take photos during the show, one defied this rule and posted pictures of Jesse naked on social media this week. Speaking during the Watch What Happens Live after-show, Jesse downplayed the pictures, insisting: 'It's a body, once you see it, you realise it's whatever, it's a boy! I just have to make it not that big of a deal.' However, the Second Stage Theatre - the production company behind Take Me Out - had a rather different viewpoint on the leaked photos, which they called a 'gross and unacceptable violation'. 'It is deeply unfortunate that one audience member chose to disrespect the production, their fellow audience members, and most importantly, the case in this matter,' they said in a statement. 'Posting it on the internet is a gross and unacceptable violation of trust between the actor and audience forged in the theater community.' Last month, Jesse admitted he'd been 'terrified' at the prospect of going nude in front of an entire theatre audience, before he embraced being taken out of his comfort zone. 'I was terrified,' he told Page Six. 'But then I noted that that was what I asked God for. I asked to be terrified. 'I asked to do something that was scary and challenging and made me earn it and made me feel alive and not comfortable.'",

When the actor was asked about the wardrobe malfunction after the event, he joked: 'Oh really? Did the sock fall out?' It didn't go unnoticed by delighted viewers at home... Ahead of competing in The Games, Ryan showed off his body transformation after 12 weeks of intense training.

Impersonating the famous 90's sketch featuring moustachioed, permed and shell-suited 'Scousers', the cabinet minister said: 'Calm down!' In the show, the actors would say 'eh alright, alright, calm down, calm down' to stop their bickering coming to blows. Gove made the unusual display when he was being quizzed on BBC Breakfast about whether there would be an emergency budget to ease the cost of living crisis. Referring to the Treasury's slap-down over speculation of an emergency budget, Gove told BBC Breakfast: 'In fact, when the Treasury quite rightly say 'calm down!' then people, instead of recognising they've overinflated the story in the first place, then say 'oh this is clearly a split'.'  The senior Conservative politician also appeared to attempt an American accent when he accused pundits of misinterpreting the prime minister's words. In an American accent he accused commentators of trying to turn Boris Johnson's comments into: 'A major, capital letters, big news story!' He also grew particularly animated when tackling the topic, waving his head in another accent saying: 'That doesn't amount to an emergency budget!' Social media users poked fun at the cabinet minister, including one who said: 'Quite a strange interview by Michael Gove this morning. Saying something that his comedy Scouser 'calm down' wasn't the worst bit.' Another added: 'Does anyone have a mechanical pencil or a pin handy, we need to reboot the Secretary of State for Levelling Up again.' Labour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner seized the moment to rinse Gove, saying: 'Is the cost of living crisis just a joke to them? This is not a serious government. We need an emergency budget right now.' Labour MP Karl Turner added: 'Embarrassing. There's a cost of living crisis and a government minister is doing silly voices during an interview.'",
    "e6ef02b5d5c5ab19d8db4ad061f5b9d2409424eaddcd2303d2cd21cd": "TW: this article contains reference to suicide, alcoholism and suicide attempts.  Will Young captured the nation's hearts with his smiley persona and sweet voice during the inaugural series of ITV's Pop Idol. But off stage, he spent 20 years trying to help his brother overcome alcoholism. His twin, Rupert, had struggled with mental illness for years, with suicide attempts that began from the age of 18. But his drinking began to spiral around 2002, just as Will's career took off. In July 2020, the singer received the devastating news that Rupert had taken his own life. In a new documentary, Will Young: Losing My Twin Rupert, the singer shares what it's like to be the family member of somebody who's alcohol dependent - and learns more about the condition that impacted all their lives. Here are seven things we learned.  Alcoholism and mental illness are intertwined  'I think the important thing to note is that the anxiety and depression that Rupert felt was there before the alcohol,' Will notes early in the programme. His family are unable to pinpoint where Rupert's unhappiness began, but Will notes that both brothers faced abusive behaviour by teachers at their boarding school, where smacking with slippers and hiding emotion was considered normal. On one occasion, Will says a teacher threw Rupert against the library bookshelf by his throat, but at the time they didn't feel able to complain or tell their parents.  You never know what's going on at home  The idea that 'you never know what's going on behind closed doors' is so often repeated, it can feel a little tired. But Will's account of going on stage during the first Pop Idol live show really brings it home. Rupert was watching in the wings and right before Will went on to sing, the stitches he had on his wrist from a recent suicide attempt burst open. Their mother recalls Rupert holding his bleeding wrist and refusing to go to the ambulance until he'd watched Will perform.  'I just thought: 'I just have to get on with it,'' Will says.  Access to treatment is dire  In England, it's estimated that there are around 1.6 million people who are alcohol dependent. And of those that need specialist treatment, just 18% are getting it.  Will admits: 'I've had over 20 years of dealing with my brother being an alcoholic and I still could not tell you what the policy is within the national health.' He meets Julia Sinclair, Professor of Addiction Psychiatry within Medicine at the University of Southampton, who tells him 'many things in the system are now broken'. For example, she knows of some areas with 18-month waiting lists and says some psychological services won't even take on the patient until they're in recovery.  'There are so few places now available,' she says. 'I think we have five inpatient units now in the country - that is it. ' The number of people impacted by alcoholism is actually closer to 8 million  Although an estimated 1.6 million people in England are alcohol dependent, we hear in the programme that for every one person struggling with this addiction, five others are impacted. So, when you consider the impact on close friends and family, it's actually more accurate to say 8 million people in England are impacted by alcoholism. Planning after rehab is vitally important  During the show Will meets Melissa Rice, an author and podcast host who's been sober for four years. 'Alcohol for me was a solution, until the solution was then the problem,' she explains. 'I developed a dependency to it because I couldn't cope with how I felt about myself.' Rice takes Will back to the rehab centre where her recovery began and speaks about the difficulty of returning home after a six-week stay.  'Wherever you're going back to - say for instance you're going back to your family - they haven't gone through this process, they haven't had all of these lessons and they haven't had the therapy,' she says. 'So you can potentially be going back to somewhere that's quite vulnerable. Planning before you leave is really important.' There's huge health inequality surrounding alcoholism  Will talks openly about the amount of money he spent trying to 'save' his brother, revealing that at one point he was paying for regular rehab stays that were PS50,000 a time.  'I'm very aware that myself and my family, because of our earning capacity, were at least able to give Rupert the chance,' he says. 'But I worry about the people who can't even get that chance.' Of course, access to the best healthcare sometimes is not enough. During the show, Will visits a rehab centre and after meeting staff, regrets never trying that particular one for his brother.  'Rupert did go to good rehabs, so I think there's a sadness that it just didn't work,' he says.  Families face impossible decisions  Will's brother moved in with him in 2016 and the singer quickly became his carer, having to clean and feed him, and deal with sick and urine mess around the house on a daily basis. When this became too much to bear - and Will worried he was 'enabling' his brother's behaviour - he asked him to leave. In July 2020, two police officers arrived at his door to tell him Rupert had taken his own life.  During the show, he meets other family members who've made impossible decisions, including Natalie Needham, the founder of the 'Stitch Away the Stigma' art project, who called the police to get her drunk father removed from her grandmother's house, affectively making him homeless. 'I did that, and now I've got to live with that,' she says. 'But it was the right thing. It's taken me a long time to get there, but it was the right thing to do...'  Throughout the programme, Will comes back to the idea that he did everything he could for his brother, but it still doesn't feel like enough. 'It bought a whole load of grief,' he says, 'the fact that I couldn't save him.' Will Young: Losing My Twin Rupert is on Channel 4 at 10.05pm, then available on All4.

    "54bd0439923aaf48f8e13e1333f19eda65626d6630c0b96badafaa13": "Succession actor James Cromwell glued himself to a Starbucks counter in protest over the coffee firm charging extra for vegan milk. The 82-year-old Oscar nominee, who is also known for his roles in Babe: Pig in the City and LA Confidential, joined the protest organised by the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in New York City. He sat on a counter wearing a 'Free the Animals' T-shirt and read a statement denouncing the surcharge for plant-based milk. 'More than 13,000 customers have asked you, now we're asking you,' he said. 'Will you stop charging more for vegan milk? When will you stop penalising people for their ethnicities, their morals?' James went on to say the 'senseless' charge affects mother cows - which are forced to reproduce to keep up with the demand for milk and then are separated from their calves. 'These mothers must endure the loss of their child over and over again,' he said. 'They suffer no less than human mothers would.' James - who plays Uncle Ewan, the anti-capitalist brother of a billionaire media mogul in Succession - later used a knife to scrape his glued hand off the counter. Police said no arrests were made over the incident. Starbucks branches in the United States charge between 50 cents to a dollar more for drinks made with plant-based milk. 'Customers can customise any beverage on the menu with a non-dairy milk, including soymilk, coconut milk, almond milk, and oat milk for an additional cost (similar to other beverage customisations such as an additional espresso shot or syrup),' a Starbucks spokesperson said in a statement. 'Pricing varies market by market.' The spokesperson added that the coffee chain respects customers' right to voice their opinions 'so long as it does not disrupt our store operations.' James was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as the farmer in 1995 film Babe and became a vegan after starring in the film. He became a vegetarian in 1974. In 2017, he was charged with trespassing for interrupting an orca show at SeaWorld in San Diego.",
    "0917ebf37d72534b32b583842cc3c33e3278e213f245b9b20c5527e4": "Michael Gove has slapped down any suggestions of an emergency budget this summer to ease the cost of living crisis.  The Levelling Up Secretary flatly denied there would be an emergency budget and suggested the prime minister's words had been overinterpreted.  Boris Johnson raised hopes of an emergency package after the Queen's Speech when he told the Commons that he and the Chancellor would say more on the cost of living 'in the days to come'. It fuelled speculation that Rishi Sunak could deliver an emergency budget to help people cope with soaring bills.  However, sources close to Sunak quickly made clear that they knew nothing about it, and insisted no new measures were due before the autumn. Gove suggested commentators were 'chasing their own tails' and told Sky News: 'There won't be an emergency budget. It is sometimes the case that the words from a prime minister or minister are overinterpreted. 'The prime minister is right. We will be saying more and doing more in order to help people with the cost-of-living challenge we face at the moment, but that doesn't amount to an emergency budget. It is part of the work of government. 'Last night the prime minister convened a group of ministers - we have all done work on some of the things we could do to help. Those policy initiatives will be announced by individual departments in due course as they are worked up. 'It is part of the process for a government that is always and everywhere thinking of how we can help and how we can provide support, both short term and long term.' Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine described the issue as a 'complete shambles.' She added: 'Millions of families and pensioners are struggling to get by. They need more help now before things get even worse in the autumn. 'Instead all we get from this Conservative government is chaos and confusion. 'An emergency budget is needed now to cut taxes for ordinary families while taxing the super profits of oil and gas companies. That would be the fair and right thing to do.'  Johnson made his comments in a debate on the Queen's Speech, which contained 38 bills but no immediate plans for dealing with the cost of living crisis. He said: 'My right honourable friend the Chancellor and I will be saying more about this in the days to come. 'But at the same time as we help people, we need the legislative firepower to fix the underlying problems in energy supply, in housing, in infrastructure and in skills which are driving up costs for families across the country. 'And this Queen's Speech takes those issues head on. And above all, we are tackling the economic challenges with the best solution of all and that is an ever growing number of high wage, high skill jobs. Jobs, jobs, jobs.' An ally of the Chancellor told HuffPost UK there were 'no announcements as far as we are aware'. They added: 'Rishi has always been clear that we would set out plans for support on energy bills for autumn when we know what the [energy] price cap is going to be - but we're not there yet.'  ",

For many fitness lovers, leg day is often the least favourite of the week. But that's often because of the misconception that you have to push your body to the point of struggling to walk the next day. Instead, why not try a short but effective lower body workout?  David Wiener, training and nutrition specialist at Freeletics, has shared a five-minute circuit with HuffPost UK that can be added into your next gym session or practiced during spare moments of the day.  'Lower body exercises are beneficial and vital for making daily tasks, such as walking, easier on us. Performing these exercises not only improves your stability, but it is a chain reaction on the rest of your body for helping improve your strength and posture,' he says.  'Ultimately, improving your lower body workout routine will give youlean muscle and achieve a stronger and more toned lower body, including the calves, thighs, hamstring and glutes.'  Try the 'no glutes, no glory' workout today and you'll never* be tempted to skip leg day again. (*Well, until next week at least.) 1. Squat Jumps This exercise is great because it's an all over body work out, but especially good for the lower body. It can help build your muscle and enhance strength, as well as boost your cardiovascular fitness, tone your lower body, strengthen bones, boost your circulation and burn many calories. To do one:Start standing with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Point your toes slightly outwards. Always keep your back straight. Always keep hands off your body. Lower down until your hips are below knees. Jump up so both feet leave ground and then return to the starting position before repeating. Rest. 2. Lunges Lunges are a great exercise to increase the muscle mass in your lower body whilst building up your strength and toning. Not only this, they also help to improve your posture, balance and range of motion. Whilst a lot of exercises put strain on your spine, lunges help give your spine a chance to relax whilst working many of the larger muscles in the lower body. To do one:Start standing upright, with your hands on your hips. Always keep your shoulders above the hips. Step forward with one foot Keep your front foot flat on the ground. Bend your back knee so it touches the ground below your hip Alternate lunging leg for the desired number of reps. Rest 3. Squats Much like a jumping squat, a normal squat has similar benefits but not as much cardio. Whilst this exercise will of course not burn as many calories as a jumping squat, it is still a great exercise to put your quadricep group of muscles to work. There's a misconception that squats put too much pressure and strain on your knees, but squats will actually strengthen your knees and make them less prone to injury as you get older.To do one:Start standing with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Point your toes slightly outward. Always keep your back straight. Always keep hands off the body. Always keep weight toward your heels. Lower down until your hips sit below your knees and rise back up to the starting position Rest 4. Split Lunges Much like the normal lunge, split lunges are a great way to work your quads, glutes, hips and hamstrings. As they are a unilateral exercise (meaning they only train one side of your body at a time), they are proven to increase your balance and posture too. Not only this, your hip flexor muscles are most commonly tight, but performing split lunges will help you improve the mobility of these muscles.To do one:Start standing upright. Always keep your shoulders above the hips. Step forward with one foot. Keep your front foot flat on the ground. Bend your back knee to touch the ground below hip. Jump up to switch sides. Make sure your feet leave ground at same time.  Rest. 5. Table Twists To enhance the flexibility of your lower body and spine, table twists are simple to perform and will stretch out all the major muscle groups in your body, helping to boost flexibility and enhance range of motion.To do one:Start with your hands below your shoulders, heels below the knees, and hips on ground. Push up until your hips are in line with your shoulders and knees. Reach one hand up and behind you. Return to the starting position. Alternative sidesAlways keep your arms straight. Rest and repeat. Move celebrates exercise in all its forms, with accessible features encouraging you to add movement into your day - because it's not just good for the body, but the mind, too. We get it: workouts can be a bit of a slog, but there are ways you can move more without dreading it. Whether you love hikes, bike rides, YouTube workouts or hula hoop routines, exercise should be something to enjoy.",

Whether it's a latte, mocha or an espresso, some of us like it so much, we have several cups a day. But how does this impact our health? Well, a new study suggests the type of coffee we select can make a difference.  Drinking coffee has been linked with raises levels of cholesterol in the blood. But the latest research suggests it could also be down to how you brew your coffee and your gender.  The findings highlight that drinking espresso was associated with the widest gender difference in cholesterol level; plunger (cafetiere) coffee was associated with the narrowest. Naturally occurring chemicals in coffee--diterpenes, cafestol, and kahweol--raise levels of cholesterol in the blood. Brewing method is influential, but until now, it's not been clear what impact espresso coffee might have, and in what quantities. So researchers sought out to compare espresso coffee with other brewing methods among adults aged 40 and older.  Those involved in the study were asked how many daily cups of coffee they drank--none, 1-2 cups; 3-5; and 6 or more--and what brew type they drank--filtered; plunger (cafetiere); espresso from coffee machines, pods, mocha pots, etc; and instant. Blood samples were taken, and height and weight measured. Information was also analysed on potentially influential factors: diet and lifestyle, including smoking, alcohol intake and physical activity; educational attainment; and whether type 2 diabetes had been diagnosed.  The data highlighted that the link between coffee and total cholesterol in their blood varied depending on brewing method, with significant sex differences for all brew types bar plunger coffee. Women drank an average of just under four cups of coffee every day whilst men drank an average of nearly five.  Drinking between three and five daily cups of espresso was significantly associated with increased serum total cholesterol [cholesterol in blood], particularly among the men. A daily tally of six or more cups of plunger coffee was also linked with higher cholesterol, to a similar degree in both sexes.  And getting through six or more cups of filtered coffee every day was associated with 0.11 mmol/l higher cholesterol among the women, but not among the men, when compared with those not drinking filtered coffee.  While instant coffee was associated with an increase in cholesterol in both sexes, this didn't rise with the number of cups drunk, when compared with those who didn't opt for coffee powder/granules. The researchers pointed out a couple of limitations to the study. Among the 21,083 participants they didn't specify a standard 'cup size'. And they noted that different types of espresso - from coffee machines, capsules, or mocha pots--are most likely to contain various levels of the key naturally occurring chemicals. 'Interestingly, coffee contains more than a thousand diverse phytochemicals. The intake of each compound also depends on the variety of coffee species, roasting degree, type of brewing method and serving size,' the researchers said.  'Coffee is the most frequently consumed central stimulant worldwide. Because of the high consumption of coffee, even small health effects can have considerable health consequences.' ",

Video and photos surfaced on Monday and quickly trended on Twitter as the actor celebrated his Tony nomination for best performance by a featured actor in a play. Jesse plays a gay baseball star who comes out and is confronted with media glare and teammate resentment. The show includes a shower scene that leaves him and others in the cast exposed.  Second Stage's Hayes Theatre has been enforcing safeguards to prevent leaks. Audience members' mobile phones are locked in cases until the end of the show, but guests are allowed to hold onto the cases during the performance, according to the venue's website. Jesse had previously said he was 'terrified' at the prospect of being naked on stage. As the images were going viral, an episode of Watch What Happens Live aired in which the actor downplayed the nudity in his Broadway debut. 'Everybody makes such a big deal,' he told host Andy Cohen. 'It's a body ... whatever.' The host then asked if it was 'better if you feel good about your penis?' 'I imagine so,' Jesse replied. 'I don't.' He said he was kidding about that.",

The monarch's ill-health meant Prince Charles took up her Queen's speech duties to mark the state opening of parliament in an unprecedented, last minute change. Nonetheless, the pomp and pageantry that marks the British head of state's biggest duty was undimmed - including the imperial state crown travelling in its own car to parliament. The crown, one of the 140 objects known as the crown jewels, is said to be priceless but has variously been estimated to be worth billions of pounds. The crown forms part of the regalia, which also includes the cap of maintenance and the sword of state. Tradition has dictated that the regalia travelled in their own gilded carriage, ahead of the monarch, escorted by senior members of the royal household from Buckingham Palace to the House of Lords.  But as part of a 'stripped back' affair, the crown has been shipped by chauffeur-driven limousine to Westminster. As a mark of the scaling back, in the hopes that the Queen could attend, two ceremonial maces were transported to the ceremony poking out of a car window. While the practice is long-standing, giving the crown its own ride - this year, to be placed in the spot where the Queen would have been sitting - struck a nerve, perhaps since it is set against the backdrop of the cost of living crisis.",
    "dbb0e1fa5bf8c24056104e0bdd0b0500e3bd57a01d4bf74b598ee209": "Elon Musk said on Tuesday that he would reverse Twitter's ban on former US president Donald Trump if he becomes the social media giant's owner. The Tesla CEO said he believes Twitter made a mistake in banning the Republican, who routinely used the website to enable hate, encourage violence and push lies. 'I think it was a morally bad decision to be clear and foolish in the extreme,' Musk said at a Financial Times event, adding that the ban 'alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice'. Twitter banned Trump amid the January 6, 2021, insurrection, citing the risk of further violence. Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat also banned him. 'I would reverse the permanent ban,' Musk said. 'I don't own Twitter yet. So this is not like a thing that will definitely happen, because what if I don't own Twitter?' Musk is in the process of buying Twitter for $44 billion, although the acquisition has not yet gone through. The billionaire has said he wants to make the website a platform for free speech, which has raised questions about whether he would allow extremists -- and Trump -- to voice hate unfettered. Trump told Fox News last month that even if Musk took over Twitter, the former president would not return to the site. He said he instead plans to stick with the sinking social media company he founded, Truth Social, which he has so far only used twice.  'I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,' Trump told the outlet, adding that he believes Musk is a 'good man' and will probably improve Twitter. The former president has a history of lies, however, so it's unclear whether he will actually stay off the site should Musk become its new owner.",
    "171dccfcbf49e0dacee752d336040c437acb491681dde90a1b6e4a5a": "1. The beginning of the Charles regency? Unquestionably, the most significant aspect of the Queen's speech was the absence of the Queen herself. Britain's heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and Prince William, his successor, took centre stage amid the pomp and pageantry of the opening of parliament on Tuesday, replacing the 96-year-old Queen Elizabeth who missed out, for the first time in almost 60 years, with health issues. The Queen's absence was marked by the imperial state crown placed on a velvet cushion in front of the empty space where she would have sat on her throne. Charles, the longest serving heir to the throne, made history as he read the 874 words of the Queen's speech for the first time, discharging his most kingly duties to date. It raises questions about whether this the start of the Charles regency, which would mean the Queen transferring her powers as monarch to her son and heir without having to abdicate under the Regency Act 1937. 2. Cost of living crisis? What cost of living crisis?  The Queen's speech contained 38 bills - setting out plans for changes to create a 'high-wage, high-skill' economy, and 'build the foundations for decades of prosperity'. But there was a lack of flesh on the bones over the pledge to 'ease the cost of living for families'. Perhaps trying to head off criticism at the pass, Boris Johnson appeared to suggest an announcement was imminent - before Downing Street was forced to deny the government is planning an emergency package of help. Sending chancellor Rishi Sunak something of a hospital pass, Johnson told the Commons: 'My right honourable friend the Chancellor and I will be saying more about this in the days to come.'   Sources close to Sunak appeared blindsided, and insisted no new measures were due before the autumn.      One ally of the chancellor told HuffPost UK: 'Rishi has always been clear that we would set out plans for support on energy bills for autumn when we know what the [energy] price cap is going to be - but we're not there yet.'   3. Beergate neuters Starmer Whether or not 'beergate' is a 'non-story', it's having an impact in Westminster. A day after Keir Starmer committed to stepping down as Labour leader if he is fined by police over an allegation he broke coronavirus laws, his travails were seized on as good sport by Tories. Opening proceedings in the Commons on the first day of the new parliamentary session, ex-Tory minister Graham Stuart spoke about the history of his Beverley and Holderness constituency's electoral controversies. He said: 'Free beer and cash were the electoral controversies then, as opposed to say, beer and curry today. Never, Mr Speaker, never in the history of human conflict has so much karma come from a korma.' Even Boris Johnson - remember, he's the man who has already been fined over breaking the lockdown rules he came up with - felt he could mock Starmer by referring to him as the 'Leader of the Opposition of the moment'. While being ribbed by Tories is to be expected, perhaps more worrying for Starmer was the apparent lack of enthusiasm among Labour MPs. 4. It's a very odd affair in 2022 The Queen's speech in May last year, with the pandemic still looming large, was an austere and pared-down affair. But despite the cost of living crisis, the state opening of parliament has returned to its default setting of maximum pomp. It might seem jarring to those having to choose between heating and eating. Here's some of the things that happen: the imperial state crown and other regalia travel ahead of the monarch in a carriage of their own. The monarch's elaborate gilded sovereign's throne was removed from the House of Lords, leaving just the consort's throne, almost identical but an inch shorter and some 30 years younger, for Charles. Charles delivered the speech to MPs and lords dressed in red ceremonial robes. While the ceremony offered a glimpse into the future, to a time when Elizabeth II's reign will inevitably come to an end and Charles will be monarch, it may also be one of the last of its kind in a country where history and traditions are facing greater scrutiny than ever. 5. Parliament is a joke Another tradition of the day is for two government MPs to propose and second the loyal address to Her Majesty. It is in effect a comedy roast with parliamentarians the target. As mentioned, Graham Stuart kicked off proceedings with a series of jabs at Keir Starmer, but on purely comedic terms he was bested by Fay Jones, who represents Brecon and Radnorshire.  Jones joked about former Conservative MP Neil Parish, who quit the Commons after watching porn in the Commons. She said: 'If I do anything in this place, it will be to bang on about the importance of farming to this country. Hence why I welcome the measures in the gracious address which will see British produce on tables around the world. 'And even the Online Safety Bill, which will protect the unsuspecting farmer from nefarious internet videos.'",

A difficult boss who is micromanaging can be reasoned with. But a toxic boss who lacks empathy can wreck your physical and mental health, causing you to lose sleep and dread each workday.  Sometimes, you may not be able to spot toxic behavior right away, but other times it is possible to identify a toxic boss who will drive you out and make your work life hell.  Here are some of the biggest warning signs that the friendly boss you met in a job interview may have a toxic side:  1. Your boss is quick to bad-mouth the person you just replaced  Angela Karachristos, a career coach who has worked in human resources, says one subtle sign new employees can notice is when their new boss bad-mouths the team members who have left.  'If you're new and your new boss is still hung up on why someone left, and is still taking it personally, that's one sign that you can spot early on,' Karachristos says. It brings 'to light that the manager doesn't separate their personal feelings about an employee from the work that they did or [the employee's] own need to move on.' The public bad-mouthing is also passive-aggressive because it signals 'that behavior is unacceptable' without telling you directly, Karachristos says. 'They are not telling you what their expectations are, but they are using the past employee as an example.'  2. Your boss will congratulate themselves, but will not praise anyone else One way to suss out toxic boss behaviour is to see how hard work and team wins get rewarded. Do you get a thoughtful message of support after completing a big project, or do you get radio silence?  If you are noticing that your boss says nothing when you win but makes a big deal about their own accomplishments, that's a worrying red flag of potential toxicity.  One type of toxic boss is a narcissistic boss. 'These are individuals who are basically incapable of caring for others or showing genuine interest in those working for them. Instead, they tend to be disconnected from others,' says Alan Cavaiola, a clinical psychologist and co-author of Impossible to Please: How to Deal With Perfectionist Coworkers, Controlling Spouses, and Other Incredibly Critical People. 'The narcissists will expect praise and adulation from others but are unable to give it to deserving staff.'  3. Your boss keeps ignoring you Be on guard if you notice that your new boss skips one-on-one meetings and does not show interest in helping you, even though you are their new team member.  If you feel as if you hardly exist to your boss, that's a sign of potential toxicity, says Lynn Taylor, a workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job. Under this kind of boss, 'you feel you constantly have to get their attention to provide feedback. Their door is often closed and conversations are rare,' Taylor says. 'You are led to believe they're just busy, but then you realise that they lack motivational managerial skills to say the least.' Taylor says you may encounter this challenging behaviour subtly or blatantly. 'When you're in a new job, it takes some time to process whether this is just a bad week for your boss, or their default behaviour,' she says.  4. Your boss only cares about whether you complete a deadline and doesn't give feedback on how you can grow   Toxic bosses prioritise output over your input. If your boss has a 'get it done' mentality, that could be a toxic red flag, says career coach Jasmine Escalera. 'It should be our boss's job to be thoughtful about how we can work best, what we need to get our jobs done, and how we can truly grow within our roles and throughout the company,' she says. 'Toxic bosses are all about getting work done, but do not focus on your own needs for development and work that taps into your strengths and skills.'  A good boss is one that communicates goals and is willing to have difficult conversations with their staff. 'Essentially a manager who has no conflict resolution skills will more than likely turn out to be toxic and won't have a psychologically safe working environment for their team,' says Minda Harts, founder of The Memo LLC, a career development company for women of colour. 5. Your boss changes their mind all the time without regard for the stress this causes to the team  A hallmark of a toxic boss is a lack of empathy. A good boss is mindful of the time and energy staff are putting in to meet their expectations.  But a toxic boss is willing to change their mind at a moment's notice, without any regard for the team's energy or stress levels. 'They get very hyper-focused on one thing,' Karachristos says. 'It becomes the sole focus of everybody's attention. There's not a clear plan, but it's all hands on deck, [but then] all of a sudden it's not anymore. This changing-mind situation can be very dangerous, because you are setting people up to fail.'  'That can cause a lot of anxiety on the team, because you don't know what is expected,' Karachristos continues. 'The first time you might be OK with it, but if it becomes a pattern, then you are always on edge because you are not sure what you are supposed to be doing.'  6. Your new co-workers act totally differently around your boss  It's normal for us to act more formally around our managers than around our peers. But if you notice a chilling pallor cast over staff when the boss enters a room, that's a warning sign to watch out for.  'If you notice that together the team talks freely and openly about problems and issues and whatever they are working on, but then when the boss is present, the conversations are much more cautious, or measured, or things are not brought to light out of fear that the boss is going to react in some way,' that's a warning sign, Karachristos says.  Colleagues being unwilling to share any thoughts about your boss is a sign, too. 'In the beginning, other colleagues will avoid chatting about the boss, raising your suspicions that they, too, are having similar issues,' Taylor says.  7. You notice the boss shows favouritism to certain team members If you realise your boss has a team favourite, that's a troubling toxic sign of a boss putting their own personal biases ahead of shared professional goals. Taylor shared an example: 'When you were interviewed, you liked the projects slated for you. But now your challenging boss is suddenly giving them to the proverbial 'teacher's pet,' and you're often the last to know.' A boss with favourites may also have colleagues they consider enemies. Watch out for the vague, subjective feedback these bosses give that is based on someone's personal attributes rather than on their ability to do the job well. 'I had one manager who kept referring to everything in vibes. 'I don't know, this employee gives me bad vibes.' That's so bad. That's not quantifiable. It's really meaningless,' Karachristos says.  8. Your boss puts you on edge and makes you scared to speak up Ultimately, one of the biggest signs that you are dealing with a toxic boss is how badly they are making you feel. If you start dreading the workday and you're only a few weeks in, that's not a feeling to ignore.  Under a toxic boss, 'you don't know when and where your manager will say or do something hurtful, so you're in a constant state of the unknown,' Taylor says. 'You wonder if it's you -- as this is a new job. You had chalked it up to your boss having a bad day, but now you're seeing a pattern.' Because toxic manager behaviour can be subtle or easy to explain away, it can be easier to notice changes in your own behaviour around them, says Lara Hogan, author of Resilient Management. 'Are you speaking up significantly less in team meetings that they're leading? Are you holding back from sharing information with them for fear of retaliation? Are you starting to choose your words extremely carefully around them? Are you avoiding being in a room or call alone with your manager?' Hogan says. 'These are all potential signals to you that your manager's behaviour might be having a significantly negative impact on you.'",
    "c24dbecd9995671d4f49286debd267f3c71fdbdc0027a9e25c9e7a51": "Vladimir Putin has endured significant losses in the 10 weeks since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February. The Russian president is not expected to call off the war any time soon, and vowed on Monday that Russia was going to continue fighting to rid Ukraine of 'torturers, death squads and Nazis'. But, as Putin continues to tout this false justification for a war which is definitely not going to plan, how much has he already lost? What Russia has lost so far The Kyiv Independent broke the losses down into these estimates, based on the Ukraine's Armed Forces as of May 10:   26,000 troops   1,170 tanks   2,808 APV (armed protected vehicles)   519 artillery systems   185 MLRS (multiple launch rocket system)   87 Anti-aircraft warfare   199 planes   158 helicopters   12 boats/cutters   380 UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle)   41 special equipment   19,980 vehicles and fuel tanks   94 cruise missiles   The real numbers may be higher, but the Ukraine Armed Forces have not had confirmation of any additional losses. These estimates are also much higher than previous suggestions that Russia had lost 15,000 troops since the war started - a stat shared by the defence secretary Ben Wallace on April 25. Speaking a few weeks ago, he added: 'At the start of this conflict Russia had committed over 120 battalion tactical groups, approximately 65% of its entire ground combat strength. 'As of now we assess around over 25% of these have been rendered not combat effective.' The Ministry of Defence (MoD) also claimed that Putin was hiding the true scale of troop losses from the Russian public. Without precision military weapons as well, it's believed that Russian planes, pilots and air to ground weapons have been missing the mark - literally - and obliterated Ukrainian civilians rather than attacking fellow military opponents. Why has Russia experienced such casualties? Experts believe Putin misjudged the war from the outset and assumed the Ukrainian population would largely welcome Russia's invasion. The MoD explained in its most recent update that Russia's 'underestimation of Ukrainian resistance' has led to 'demonstrable operational failings'. The UK officials also claimed this prevented Putin from announcing 'significant military success in Ukraine' during Victory Day, the Russian national holiday which was celebrated on Monday. The Kremlin was expected to use the symbolic occasion, which remembers the Red Army's victory over the Nazis in World War 2, to announce further military mobilisation - but it didn't happen. The MoD continued: 'Russia's invasion plan is highly likely to have been based on the mistaken assumption that it would encounter limited resistance and would be able to encircle and bypass population centres rapidly. 'This assumption led Russian forces to attempt to carry out the opening phase of the operation with a light, precise approach intended to achieve a rapid victory with minimal cost. 'The miscalculation led to unsustainable losses and a subsequent reduction in Russia's operational focus.' So what did Putin say in his latest speech? The Russian president stopped short of calling for new action from his troops, or further mobilisation. He only announced that extra aid would go to the children of killed or wounded soldiers. Putin did not announce victory - even in the destroyed Ukrainian city of Mariupol - but equally did not promise the conflict would end any time soon. He did not threaten further nuclear action and made no announcements about being at war with the west, despite heavily criticising Europe and the US for sending aid to Ukraine in recent weeks. His speech was actually much more low-key compared to his previous statements related to the war and Russia's so-called opponents. The parade in Moscow was also more modest than previous years even though, according to Russian media, 11,000 troops and 131 armoured vehicles took part. According to the New York Times, Putin might be concerned there is not enough public support for the war efforts to push anything too extreme on the country, as troops run low on morale and the west's sanctions on Russia come into effect.",

The hall is the oldest building on today's parliamentary estate and has been the scene of historic events, including the state trials of William Wallace, Sir Thomas More, Guy Fawkes and Charles I. Many notable occasions of lying-in-state have also taken place in the hall including William Gladstone, King George V, Winston Churchill and the Queen Mother. But in a damning indictment of the condition of the building's exterior, measures have had to be brought in to protect staff walking by from 'falling masonry'.  An email to MPs, seen by HuffPost UK, said: 'Following a survey of the north facade of Westminster Hall, the area has been identified as degrading at a faster rate than expected with a risk of stone fall identified. Additional safety measures have been put in place. 'Following tactile inspections, mitigation is required to protect the immediate area below from falling masonry. Temporary exclusion zones have been formed using a flexible barrier system to the East and West of the main entrance.' The email was sent to MPs yesterday, the day before the biggest event in the parliamentary calendar - the State Opening of Parliament in which Prince Charles delivered the Queen's Speech.  They said the measures would remain in place until 'protective scaffolding' is installed, due at the start of the summer recess or 'earlier if possible'. MPs were then warned to take 'particular care' in the area and avoid the cordoned off areas. Figures released earlier this year revealed there had been 15 incidents in the last three years in which stonework had come crashing down. In April 2018, a football sized chunk of masonry broke away from a stone angel on parliament's Victoria Tower and plummeted 230ft to the ground. And in October 2017 an MP's car windscreen was smashed when a piece of masonry fell from a building.  Despite being one of the world's most iconic heritage sites, the palace is in a state of disrepair and urgently needs major restoration works.  A recent report found the works needed to save the palace could cost up to PS22 billion and last 76 years. But the project has been subject to a number of set backs and a desire from some MPs to remain in the historic building. It comes after HuffPost UK revealed that renovation work had to be halted and the Health and Safety Executive launched an investigation after a asbestos leak last October. Up to 117 people were potentially exposed to asbestos in the leak over four days during works on the Speaker's bedrooms. A UK parliament spokesperson said on Tuesday: 'Following a survey of the north facade of Westminster Hall, a risk of stone fall has been identified. 'As a result, additional safety mitigations are being implemented whilst investigations continue and conservation takes place. 'We work hard to keep parliament safe for both the members of the public that visit and for the staff and parliamentarians that work here. Where issues are identified we act quickly to address them.'",

The end of season five of the reality show saw the realtor caught up in all sorts of drama as she faced accusations she'd attempted to bribe a seller into working with her instead of colleague Emma Hernan - something Christine has vehemently denied. During a cast reunion episode, which dropped on Netflix on Friday, brokerage boss Jason Oppenheim subsequently said that 'right now there's not a place for her at the Oppenheim group'.  After her image was also removed from the brokerage's website, Christine has now offered her own explanation, insisting it was actually her decision to leave.  Commenting on a TikTok video, she said: 'Of course there's no place for me. I terminated my contract weeks ago prior to filming.' 'I have my own company now lol,' she added in reference to her new real estate venture, Real Open, which she announced last month.  Christine also made similar comments during an appearance on E! News' Daily Pop, saying: 'I am my own broker now, so I've been working on that. I terminated my contract, yes, and started my own brokerage.' However, Christine was not pressed directly on the accusations made against her at the end of the season.  Jason previously said during the reunion: 'We've texted and we haven't really addressed this situation. She hasn't reached out to talk about it. I know that she has some thoughts on it. 'Right now, there's not a place for her at The Oppenheim Group,' he continued. 'In the future, if she takes real estate seriously, if I can get an understanding of her perspective on things, if she changes her behaviour, if she brings in a big listing - there's a lot of reasons where I could consider her having a place at The Oppenheim Group but I have to say right now, there isn't a place.' However, it does not look like Christine's departure from the company necessarily means the end of her time on Selling Sunset.  'It means we might have to get a little creative when it comes to the new season, because it's going to be like a battle of the brokerages, so it will be fun,' she told Daily Pop.  During the interview Christine also addressed claims she had used Covid as an excuse to skip the cast reunion after she was allegedly pictured on the set of a shoot the next day.  'I did test positive [for Covid],' Christine insisted. 'I had a campaign due the next day. Like, I gotta get my bag at the end of the day. So, I was fine. I didn't miss out on anything.' Selling Sunset is streaming now on Netflix. ",

Boris Johnson posted his first public video on TikTok on Tuesday as he launched 10 Downing Street's account on the video platform, particularly popular among children, teenagers and young adults. He said: 'Hi folks, this is Boris Johnson here, launching the No.10 TikTok account. 'You won't necessarily catch me dancing on here, but we will have all sorts of stuff about what we're doing to deliver on our priorities, deliver for you on our agenda on uniting and levelling up our country. 'And you'll get all sorts of messages and content that you might not get if you're looking at Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn - and all the other stuff. 'This is intended to be a place where we can put out messages and behind the scenes insight into what we are getting done, so tune in to No.10 TikTok!' As of two hours after its launch, the account is not following any other users but has accumulated more than 2000 followers itself and 1630 likes from the general public. The video itself was more than 46,000 times in those two hours - but not all the comments were exactly complimentary. One account wrote, 'the comments are gonna be turned off so quick,' while another asked: 'What made you think this would ever be a good idea.' Some people joked, 'Theresa would have danced' - presumably a reference to the former prime minister Theresa May's infamous dance moves - and there were also requests for 'a BTS from the 2020 parties' and a 'TikTok on your hair routine babes'. Amid the witty asides there were plenty of comments simply stating, 'resign'. On a more serious note, one user pointed out: 'Country going into recession so the government made a TikTok to help us.' Johnson is not the only minister on the platform - culture secretary Nadine Dorries set up her account several weeks ago, sharing her ideas about the UK's media landscape and unpacking various political events including the Queen's Speech. She made a small faux pas during a video in April, when she accidentally told fellow TikTokers that you could 'downstream' your movies. TikTok mostly attracts Gen Zers - those born between 1997 and 2012 - and says 60% of its users come from this age group. It boomed throughout the pandemic and is known for its short, snappy video content which is tailored to each user's interests.",
    "5d7bd27579dd94295cd9719dc7f8950cddc5f60e90bdb3d580b80298": "The Conservatives have watered down plans to ban conversion therapy, meaning over-18s can be subject to it as long as they provide consent. The government has repeatedly said it considers conversion therapy to be a 'abhorrent' practice and the pledge to ban it was included in today's Queen's Speech. However, it has now emerged that the ban will only protect over-18s who 'do not consent and who are coerced or forced to undergo conversion therapy practices'. All under 18s will continue to be protected from the ban regardless of their circumstances. A document outlining the Conversion Therapy Bill stated that the government would introduce a 'criminal offence banning non-physical conversion therapies to complement existing legislation which protects people from acts which inflict physical harm' But it added: 'The offence will protect under-18s, regardless of circumstance, and over-18s who do not consent and who are coerced or forced to undergo conversion therapy practices.' Asked to justify the changes, the prime minister's official spokesperson said: 'This is a difficult area and we need to strike the right balance. 'It is obviously abhorrent to force this on anyone, but it is a complex area that needs careful management -- that's why I think it's important to wait for the full details of the bill.' The spokesman also cited the need for religious teachings to not be inadvertently affected by any ban.  'It's important that the freedom to express religious teachings is not affected by the ban, individuals will still be able to access support and counsel from religious leaders should they wish,' they said. 'But that's a separate issue to seeking to force this abhorrent practice on people.' The government has also been criticised for not pushing ahead with any form of conversion therapy for transgender people. Instead it has said 'separate work' needs to be done on the issue of transgender conversion therapy, but that separate legislation will not be introduced. 'The government will continue doing more policy work on that front before providing further updates,' the spokesperson said. The decision to not include trans people in the Queen's Speech was roundly criticised by some campaigners. Charity Mermaids said the Queen's Speech 'failed trans people'. 'The government has committed, yet again, to ban conversion therapy...despite being the one legislative promise to the LGBT+ community.' Stonewall tweeted: This pared down bill will end up protecting nobody.' 'We urge the UK government to not play politics with LGBTQ+ lives and listen to the experts - including NHS England and the British Psychological Society - and introduce a ban that protects ALL LGBTQ+ people.'",
    "7209beeb7471e58bd53156081ed8a01f23df029ac0516d89a6c4f700": "Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer were caught smiling at one another in a rare - and surprising - moment on Tuesday. The prime minister and the leader of the opposition are rarely seen together away from PMQs, where they furiously take down one another's arguments. This time, however, they were caught on camera chatting causally while on their way to listen to the Queen's Speech for the State Opening of Parliament. The BBC's commentators even noticed the incident during the live footage, with presenter Huw Edwards pointing out: 'That was a little more jolly than I would have expected really.' The friendliness is particularly remarkable because both Starmer and Johnson are currently under police investigation for potentially breaching Covid lockdown rules at different events. Starmer was one of the most vocal critics about Johnson's involvement in partygate - the series of gatherings said to have taken place in Downing Street throughout the pandemic - only for the Tories to then push for a new probe into the Labour leader's own supposed rule-breaking one night last year. Starmer then announced on Monday that he would resign from his position if the police did fine him for breaching social distancing rules in the so-called beergate row. In turn, this has put pressure on the prime minister. He has already been fined once for attending his own birthday party in June 2020, and could face an additional three fines for other Downing Street events, but he is refusing to resign. Johnson has also triggered controversy in the past through his personal attacks on the Labour leader, and even falsely blamed Starmer for not prosecuting Jimmy Savile when he was director of public prosecutions. Despite all of this tension in the background and the two opponents' careers potentially hanging on a thread, the men chatted with relative ease as they walked from the House of Commons to the House of Lords this morning. Twitter didn't wait long to turn it into a meme though, with users sharing takes on what it was really like between the two politicians in that moment. The two party leaders weren't the only ones who were ridiculed for their role in the State Opening of Parliament either. Prince Charles, who was filling in for the Queen today, was mocked for his sombre delivery of the Queen's Speech - and his rather unamused expression.",
    "38984708f4fff8497f03cd986fc92f90ed88c96df2b1fe63b2f62f4b": "As a lover of Roman mythology, Boris Johnson will be well acquainted with the tale of Emperor Nero fiddling while his city burned. Regardless of the fact that the story is probably untrue, it has come to symbolise any out-of-touch leader unwilling to take the necessary action to help his people when they are struggling. So it was with today's Queen's Speech. A higher-than-normal 38 pieces of legislation were unveiled, ranging from the Levelling Up And Regeneration Bill to the Brexit Opportunities Bill. However, there was nothing to address the biggest challenge facing families up and down the country - a cost of living crisis which is only going to get worse in the months ahead. In his introduction to the legislative programme, the prime minister acknowledged the problem - but insisted the best approach was to take a long-term approach to tackling it.  'For every pound of taxpayer's money we spend on reducing bills now, it is a pound we are not investing in bringing down bills and prices over the longer term,' the PM said.   'And that if anything, this moment makes clear our best remedy lies in urgentlydelivering on our mission to turbo charge the economy, create jobs and spreadopportunity across the country.' Which is all very laudable, but of absolutely no use to families wondering how they'll make their budget stretch until the next pay day, or those on benefits having to make the agonising choice between heating their home and feeding their kids. As Dan Paskins of Save the Children said: 'The cost of living crisis is an emergency the UK government should be dealing with right now. The Queen's Speech was a major opportunity to support those most affected by rising costs, and the government didn't take it.' The PM is also taking a massive political gamble as well. With the Tories already trailing Labour in the polls, and the measures the government has already announced widely seen as insufficient, Johnson is hoping that voters - and Tory MPs - give him the time he wants to turn the economy around. Johnson will be well aware that things did not end well for Nero after he lost the support of his people and his closest aides abandoned him.  The PM will be keen to ensure that the same fate does not befall him. ",
    "18abe590b2b9b5320f8b53787e95002d81ab3c405efd9ab0ffe82950": "The Tories were accused of being 'out of touch' after they ditched their flagship employment bill from today's Queen's Speech. Despite dozens of promises to deliver legislation to boost workers' rights, long-awaited reforms were absent from Tuesday's announcement. They included a clamp down on sexual harassment and workplace pregnancy discrimination as well as making flexible working the default, unless employers had a good reason to refuse it.  Labour's Tulip Siddiq told HuffPost UK that BAME workers and mothers would 'pay the price'. The shadow economic secretary to the treasury said: 'Yet again this out-of-touch Conservative government has failed to deliver on its promise of making flexible working the default. 'Sadly, I'm not surprised - Jacob Rees-Mogg's refusal to even consider greater flexibility for civil servants, demonstrates this government's disdain for modern working practices. 'It's BAME workers and mothers - who too often have to sacrifice their career to care for their children - who will pay the price for the government's failure to bring forward an employment bill. 'Businesses will lose out too - research from Ernst and Young found that 57 per cent of businesses boosted their productivity due to introducing greater flexibility during the pandemic. 'It's time for the government to implement my flexible working bill, supported by MPs from across the house, to make flexible working a right for all.' In 2019, the government said its employment bill would make the country 'the best place in the world to work' after Brexit. However, more than two years after that pledge, no employment bill has been published by the government. Other policies floated as part of the legislation included a single agency to enforce employee rights, ensuring tips go to workers in full, a right for workers to request a more predictable contract, the right to a week's leave for unpaid carers and paid leave for parents with children needing neonatal care. The Trades Union Congress [TUC] said 'bad bosses' would be celebrating over the government's 'broken promise' and accused ministers of 'turning their back' on working people. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'The prime minister promised to make Britain the best place in the world to work. But he has turned his back on working people. 'Today, bad bosses up and down the country will be celebrating. 'No employment bill means vital rights that ministers had promised - like default flexible working, fair tips and protection from pregnancy discrimination - risk being ditched for good. 'And it means no action on the scourge of insecure work and ending exploitative practices like zero-hours contracts and fire and rehire.'",
    "a5c8dbea4026f3ce5aecffc98a3430b3e05947e46286a23564bf6a9d": "Boris Johnson ruled out any immediate help for families struggling with the cost of living crisis as he outlined his government's plans for the next 12 months. The prime minister unveiled a staggering 38 bills in the Queen's Speech - but there were no emergency measures to tackle the misery caused to millions by soaring bills. Instead, he said the government would 'turbo charge the economy' over the long term in order to create thousands of new, well-paid jobs. In his introduction to the government's legislative programme, Johnson said ministers had already announced PS22bn-worth of measures to help bring down energy and council tax bills. He added: 'But we must also remember that for every pound of taxpayer's money we spend on reducing bills now, it is a pound we are not investing in bringing down bills and prices over the longer term. 'And that if anything, this moment makes clear our best remedy lies in urgentlydelivering on our mission to turbo charge the economy, create jobs and spreadopportunity across the country.' Johnson said it was important for the government to balance the books following the economic damage caused by the pandemic. And he insisted his administration was prepared to step in to help those struggling to make ends meet if necessary. He said: 'I know people are struggling with their bills, and that they are anxiousabout the future. But we will get the country through it just as we got through Covid-19, with every ounce of ingenuity and compassion and hard work. 'While we must keep our public finances on a sustainable footing - and we cannot completely shield people from the fallout from global events - where we can help, we will. 'And over the coming months we will continue examining what more we can do to ease the pressures on hard-working people and families. 'From the moment I became prime minister, my mission has been to deliver for the British people. Over the remainder of this parliament, this government will work night and day to ensure we do just that.' Among the legislation announced in the Queen's Speech, which was delivered by Prince Charles after the Queen was forced to pull out over health concerns, are a Levelling Up And Regeneration Bill, a Public Order Bill, a Schools Bill and a Brexit Opportunities Bill.",
    "574b2d0729c42a803f8e556f934574a555a0004e8d1b5711d8d6173c": "Hair and beauty aficionados or watchers of Bridgerton might have noticed something in the way of a 'hack' - that of applying oil on the scalp to stimulate healthy hair growth. The trick has been garnering attention on social media, with the moniker 'hair slugging' and 'hair oiling' taking hold on TikTok. This describes the art of rubbing a penetrative oil (as opposed to a hair shine or non-greasing oil) and massaging it around the head. And now it's gone mainstream - amassing more than 35.8 million views and counting, with many touting it as a new and revolutionary method set to change your hair game. But actually, it's not new at all. South Asians have been practicing 'hair slugging,' or a thel maalish as we know, it for centuries. We even saw it on Bridgerton as Edwina had her hair lovingly massaged by her sister on the hit Netflix show, an ode to a 5,000-year-old tradition, started through the Indian science of Ayurveda. Many South Asians still adhere to the ritual, including me, and it's probably what contributes to our lush, long tresses in the community - in fact, India is the top global supplier of human hair to be made into wigs, so clearly we're getting healthy hair right.  For many, a thel malish holds many significances, including nostalgia, special moments with a loved one, or even difficult memories that were overcome.  For me, the smell of one particular brand (Amla thel, for those who are familiar), evokes the strongest memories of my late grandmother, whose hair was always sleeked back with the thel, the fragrance adorning her saree. When I catch a whiff of it, I'm bought back to wonderful memories of her.  So, seeing products like Amla thel lined up in Superdrug and the like under 'deep conditioning treatments' feel somewhat uncanny.  I'm glad we have more options to buy items like this in the mainstream, and that the practice is gaining recognition for all its benefits. But it's not a new thing started by beauty influencers and mammoth brands.  For many, the easy acceptance of this trend when it's boosted by Western content creators and brands, but was shunned when we went to school with greasy hair, sparks difficult feelings. Many were bullied for greasy hair and internalised shame and embarrassment for adhering to a cultural practice. Others, as children, hated having to sit still as their mother or another matriarch (it's usually practiced by women) thoroughly (and painfully if you have curly hair) rubbed the oil from their fingertips to the scalp in circular motion.  Now, we'd be glad to get a thel maalish from a loved one. And it's cool that we can simply pop down to a local drug store to pick one up. We only wish it was normal to mask your hair in oil back in the day too, and that it's now given credit where credit is due. Because South Asians truly do have enviable hair. ",
    "6afda82ef5cddf78d70d5eca4a76c19a8f7357a711569aa6dc64549b": "Boris Johnson, fresh from heavy losses at last week's local elections, has unveiled his legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session. The government wants to focus on economic growth in the wake of the pandemic, as voters grapple with the cost of living crisis. The Queen's Speech, this year delivered by Prince Charles, revealed 38 Bills in total. Here is a run down of some of the key pieces of legislation being proposed. Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill The prime minister has tried to put reducing regional inequality at the centre of his leadership. This legislation, being led by Michael Gove, requires an annual report on progress to be published. The planning system will be reformed to give residents more involvement in local development. And it will help towns force landlords to rent out empty shops to regenerate high streets. Local residents will also be given more of a say over changing street names. The government says it will also ensure 'everyone can continue to benefit from al fresco dining'. Bill of Rights Dominic Raab's Bill will replace the Human Rights Act, which put the European Convention on Human Rights into UK domestic law. Many Conservatives have complained that it expanded human rights protections too far, including limiting the government's ability to deport foreign criminals. The new legislation, the government says, will curb the 'incremental expansion of a rights culture'. A key part of the Bill is also 'defending freedom of speech'. This will be done by 'promoting greater confidence in society to express views freely', according to the government. Public Order Bill This is a plan to crack down on what the government says are disruptive 'guerrilla protests'. It will outlaw tactics such as protesters 'locking on' to public transport infrastructure or gluing themselves to roads, which have been adopted by campaign groups such as Insulate Britain. Stop and search powers for police will also be extended to search for and seize articles related to protest-related offences. It represents a bid to revive measures which were previously put forward under the now-passed Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill but had to be scrapped after being knocked back by the House of Lords. Schools Bill The education package is also being sold as an attempt at levelling up, helping every child fulfil their potential 'wherever they live'. It creates new regulations for academies and introduces a direct National Funding Formula, so that each mainstream school will be allocated funding on the same basis. Schools will also be required to publish an attendance policy and creates a 'children not in school' register. The current teacher misconduct regime will be strengthened, with new powers to investigate teachers who accused of misconduct. Brexit Freedoms Bill The government wants to 'seize the opportunities' of the UK leaving the EU to 'enable economic growth'. The main purpose of the legislation is to allow the government to amend, repeal or replace the large amounts of retained EU law without having to propose new primary legislation each time. It will also assert the sovereignty of parliament by removing the supremacy of retained EU law over UK law in the legal system. Conversion Therapy Bill This will ban the practise of so-called conversion therapy, which seeks to suppress or change a person's sexual orientation. But it will not ban conversion therapy targeted at trans people, a decision which triggered a significant backlash from many Tory MPs, as well as opposition parties and LGBT groups, when the plan was leaked last month. Media Bill This legislation is designed to allow the government to privatise Channel 4, which the government says will enable it to 'continue to thrive and grow'. But the plan faces significant opposition. Many Tory MPs are unhappy with the idea and Labour has warned it could lead to the channel being 'gobbled up' by US media companies. Harbours (Seafarers' Remuneration) Bill This is about P&O. The ferry company caused outrage in March when it sacked 800 staff and replaced them with cheaper agency workers. This legislation will allow ports to refuse access to ferry services that do not pay an equivalent to the National Minimum Wage. Other Bills include: Transport Bill Provides the new 'Great British Railways' body with the powers it needs to take control of the railway system. Energy Security Bill Focused on paving the way for new, low-carbon technologies and growing the consumer market for electric heat pumps. Will also appoint Ofgem as the new regulator for heat networks and extend the energy price cap. Draft Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Bill Cracks down on 'subscription traps' and fake reviews, strengthens protections for consumers using Christmas savings clubs. Also gives the Competition and Markets Authority the ability to decide for itself when consumer law has been broken, and to issue penalties for those breaches. UK Infrastructure Bank Bill Establishes the bank in law, with clear objectives to support regional and local economic growth and deliver net zero. Non-Domestic Rating Bill This will shorten the business rates revaluation cycle from five to three years from 2023. Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill Requires manufacturers, importers and distributors of smart devices to comply with minimum security standards. Electronic Trade Documents Bill This will put electronic trade documents on the same legal footing as their paper equivalents, which the Government says will cut down on 'wasteful paperwork' and 'needless bureaucracy'. High Speed Rail (Crewe - Manchester) Bill Provides the powers to build and operate the next stage of the High Speed Two (HS2) network between Crewe and Manchester. Draft Audit Reform Bill This will establish a new statutory regulator, the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority, and empower it to enforce directors' financial reporting duties. Procurement Bill This will enshrine in law the objectives of public procurement including: delivering value for money, maximising public benefit, treating suppliers equally and without discrimination, and acting, and being seen to act, with integrity. Financial Services and Markets Bill Revokes retained EU law on financial services and updates regulators' objectives to bring about a greater focus on growth and international competitiveness. Data Reform Bill The legislation will reform the UK's data protection regime, replacing the regulations inherited from the European Union with a system 'focused on privacy outcomes rather than box-ticking'. Trade (Australia and New Zealand) Bill The legislation will ensure the UK can comply with the obligations set out in the free trade deals struck with Australia and New Zealand. Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Bill The new laws will remove EU measures which prevent the development and marketing of 'precision bred' plants and animals using techniques such as gene editing. Higher Education Bill Could be used to set minimum qualification requirements for a person in England to be eligible for student loans to go to university, effectively restricting access. Will also create a lifelong loan entitlement to support people to retrain. Social Housing Regulation Bill Aimed at improving tenants' rights in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster, with beefed-up powers for the regulator. Renters Reform Bill This will seek to abolish so-called 'no fault' evictions by removing Section 21 of the Housing Act 1988 but also seek to reform possession grounds for landlords, strengthening them for repeated cases of rent arrears. Social Security (Special Rules for End of Life) Bill This will aim to allow more people nearing the end of their life to access three disability benefits: Personal Independence Payment, Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance. National Security Bill This will reform existing espionage laws in a bid to tackle modern threats and bring in new offences to target state-backed sabotage, foreign interference, stealing trade secrets and assisting a foreign intelligence service. Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill This will seek to crack down on illicit finance, including by creating new powers to seize crypto assets more quickly and increasing powers to check information on the Company Register. Modern Slavery Bill This will aim to increase support for victims of human trafficking and modern slavery, including by toughening sanctions for breaches of Slavery and Trafficking Prevention and Risk Orders. Online Safety Bill Carried over from the previous parliamentary session, the legislation includes measures aimed at forcing online giants to take responsibility for protecting users and removing illegal content. Draft Victims Bill The legislation will enshrine the Victims' Code in law and improve the support they receive - particularly for victims of sexual violence, domestic abuse and serious violence. Draft Protect Duty Bill In the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing the legislation will introduce new requirements for certain public locations and venues to draw up plans to respond to terrorism. Draft Mental Health Act Reform Bill Overhauls existing powers to protect patient liberty and prevent those with learning difficulties from being detained without their consent. Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill Creates a system for immunity from prosecution for Troubles-related offences and sets up a new Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery to enable individuals and family members to seek and receive information about what happened to their loved ones. Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Bill The legislation will enhance and develop the Ulster Scots/Ulster British tradition in Northern Ireland while recognising and protecting the Irish language, based on measures in the New Decade, New Approach Deal. Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill The law will ban live exports, tackle puppy smuggling and prohibit keeping primates as pets without a licence. Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill Seen as part of the Government's culture war agenda, the legislation will introducing new freedom of speech and academic duties on higher education providers, their constituent colleges and students' unions. Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions Bill Prevents public bodies effectively running their own foreign policies by pursuing campaigns to boycott goods from certain countries. The move comes in the wake of efforts by councils to boycott goods from Israel.",
    "6c7568d79aa5f8fc8229d2bf6a75f69fd4c0fe56ad4b459227f46466": "A new spoof video where a drag queen poses as the actual Queen for the State Opening of Parliament takes aim at the government's controversial approach to trans conversion therapy. On Tuesday, the ceremonial Queen's Speech - which will actually be delivered by her heir Prince Charles this time - unpacks what legislation Downing Street will be focusing on in the upcoming session of parliament. Drag queen River Medway, a former contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race UK, joined forces with LGBTQ+ charity Mermaids to criticise No.10's decision not to ban trans conversion therapy earlier this year. The video begins in a jokey tone, with Medway dressed up in regal drag in a mock-up of the House of Lords. She addresses the camera with: 'My lords, ladies, gentle thems and theybes, please be seated.' The drag queen then dives into Boris Johnson's decision to only ban gay conversion therapy, which has been widely condemned across the political spectrum. Medway explains: 'My government has royally messed up, deciding that protecting trans people from a ban on conversion practises is not a priority - despite the fact that the government knows how damaging it is and knows trans people are at a higher risk than the rest of the LGBTQ community. 'Conversion practices take many forms, from psychiatric to religious, or cultural interventions. 'They can be carried out by anyone, including community leaders and family members. 'But one thing they all have in common is that they are extremely cruel. and they do not work.' Conversion therapy aims to suppress or change a person's sexual orientation. It is also used in a bid to make trans people's gender identity correspond with the sex they had at birth. NHS England has described the practice as 'unethical and potentially harmful', while mental health charity Mind said it has a 'terrible impact on a person's mental health'. Back in the video, Medway continues: 'My government promised to protect trans people. It has broken that promise. One cannot get involved in constitutional matters - I am the queen, after all - but you can do something about this. 'Write to my ministers and your members of parliament and ask them to speak up for a ban that protects trans people. 'A government should be accountable to its people. So tell them they've got this one wrong. 'I pray that they listen to you and keep trans in the ban. Now can I get an A-Them?'  The government first pledged to ban conversion therapy back in 2018 under former prime minister Theresa May.  Only in October last year, the prime minister's wife Carrie Johnson promised a reception at a Tory Party conference that the government was 'completely committed' to LGBTQ+ rights. Boris Johnson defended his decision to exclude trans people from the conversion therapy ban in April, when he said there were 'complexities and sensitivities' when 'you move from the area of sexuality to the question of gender'.",

A 90-second trailer for Avatar: The Way Of Water dropped online on Monday, picking up with the natives of Pandora more than a decade after we last saw them.  The new film will follow the Sully family, documenting the battles they fight and the tragedies they endure to keep each other safe. While the Avatar 2 trailer gives very little away in terms of plot, fans did get to see more of the stunning CGI that captivated audiences around the globe the first time around.  The film sees Zoe Saldana and Sam Worthington reprise their roles as Jake Sully and Na'vi Neytiri, while Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang are back as Dr Grace Augustine and Colonel Miles Quaritch. Kate Winslet will also join the cast of the sci-fi action adventure film.  Avatar went on to become the highest grossing film of all time when it was released in 2009 - a title it still holds to this day.  Avatar: The Way of Water is released in cinemas on 16 December 2022.",

After winning for Norway with his signature tune Fairytale back in 2009, he's returned to the competition on several occasions, joining fellow Eurovision alum in various interval medleys over the years and even appearing as himself in the Netflix comedy Eurovision Song Contest: The Story Of Fire Saga. Looking back at his victory 13 years later, Alexander is still far from tired of his winning entry, instead insisting he feels 'more and more blessed' to have the 'worldwide hit and calling card' in his catalogue as time goes by. 'I love every time I get to perform it,' he tells HuffPost UK shortly before this year's Eurovision gets underway. 'Fairytale lets me have fun with music and experiment with new genres and styles every year. 'It's essentially an old-fashioned oom-pah tune with Tin Pan Alley chords, but people called it a 'modern tune' because I believed in it in the here and now. I will be forever grateful for the people who stream it and show it to their friends, so that it may live on and be discovered by new generations.'  In recent years, Alexander has made something of a u-turn in his life, relocating from Oslo to the US, where he's pursuing a lifelong dream and studying music composition for the screen at Columbia College in Chicago. Still, having returned as a Eurovision competitor for Norway in 2017, Alexander admits the contest is still something he'd return to for a third time - 'and a fourth... and a seventh!' - were the right song to come his way. Here's what else Alexander had to say when we asked him about all things Eurovision... What's your earliest memory of watching Eurovision?  Actually it was in 2008, the year before I won. If I like something, I've always been like a kid who points at the screen and says 'I wanna try that, too!'. I was also very inspired by Maria Haukaas Storeng, the Norwegian participant that year, who came fifth with Hold On Be Strong. I didn't think too much before starting writing Fairytale, specifically with Eurovision in mind. Have you always been a fan of Eurovision? How has your opinion of it changed over time? I've always been a huge fan. And I'm grateful for every time someone invites me to perform at a national selection or anything else connected to the Eurovision Song Contest. Do you have a favourite memory of being part of Eurovision? Honestly, what I love the most is being part of the medleys and interval acts. I love getting together with other Eurovision artists on stage! I loved being part of the Love, Love, Peace, Peace interval performance in Sweden in 2017. Mans Zelmerlow is not only a great Eurovision winner, but a great comedian, as it turned out. However, my most, most, most favourite moment was in Baku in 2012, when I performed along with [fellow winners] Lena, Dima Bilan and Marija Serifovic. What are your three all-time favourite Eurovision songs and why? Rise Like A Phoenix by Conchita Wurst because it hits me in the feels every single time. Heroes by Mans Zelmerlow is beautiful because it's perfect. And Amar Pelos Dois by Salvador Sobral is beautiful because it's imperfect. Who are you rooting for at Eurovision in 2022 and why? I'm rooting for Norway because they are hardworking wolves - on social media as well as on stage. And because they've got a really cool concept behind their song. Why is Eurovision still so important? The more spread out our entertainment choices become, and the more streaming options we get, the more we get into our own custom-made bubbles. So we need something like Eurovision to unite us once in a while! Follow Alexander on TikTok here. 'I can't complain about the warm welcome the TikTok community has given me, since I started last year,' he explains. 'But I'll never do the dances. No, sir.' Take a listen to his latest single Memories below: We'll be publishing an interview with a different Eurovision legend every day leading up to this year's live final on Saturday 14 May.

    "219ed067ec8246d42dae0e1e69cebd21a13da30c84033363c8bd60a5": "Sophie Ellis-Bextor has revealed the 'kooky' Eurovision rules that led to her turning down the offer to judge the annual song contest. The singer was approached to be part of the 2019 judging panel but decided not to participate because of two specific rules. Speaking to Radio Times, Sophie said that due to the success of her hit song Murder On The Dancefloor - which was the most played track in Europe in 2002 - she had a 'conversation' about becoming a competition judge. 'I had a very small baby that I was still feeding, and they wouldn't let me bring it along,' she said. She then joked: 'I'm pretty sure the baby would have been impartial but, you know what, I think part of what I like about Eurovision is that it has very much got its rules... it's kooky.' As well as the apparent 'no babies' rule, Sophie also revealed that the judges have to remain silent throughout the judging process. 'We weren't going to be allowed to speak while we were watching it either,' she revealed. 'And I thought, 'I can't watch Eurovision in silence'.' Sophie added that Eurovision had always been a part of her life since she was 'tiny' and watched the programme with her parents as a child. 'My parents always watched Eurovision and I remember watching it during the 80s when I was in single digits and being pretty fascinated by what I saw,' she said. She added that the 'political undertones' to Eurovision, and Britain's famous lack of success in recent years, was 'part of the fun'. 'We should probably brace ourselves for another 'nul points' score,' she said. 'There have always been political undertones (to the voting), which again, is part of the fun. We quite enjoy that, I think. 'It's part of the reason Britain treats it in an almost ironic way, and I don't think it will ever lose that, but some of the songs that are good can have a life outside of Eurovision and be treated as legitimate hits.' This year's contest will be held in Turin, Italy and will see 32-year-old TikTok star Sam Ryder representing the UK with his song Space Man. Despite Sophie's reservations about our chances of success, Sam is currently the bookies second favourite to win. According to Oddschecker - who compare betting odds from around 25 of the UK's bookies - Sam has overtaken the representatives for both Italy and Sweden, and is now second favourite to win Eurovision on behalf of the UK for the first time in 25 years. Ukraine is still the firm favourite, where they'll be represented by Kalush Orchestra with their song Stefania. The Eurovision final airs on Saturday at 8pm on BBC One, BBC Radio 2 and BBC iPlayer.

    "a9789123e38aca37d6b51ca1ef761c28f06bdf5c464057eb5802dcf2": "A fourth-dose Covid jab might be on the cards for the general population after a UK trial found it increased protection against the virus. The majority of people in the UK received their third vaccine in the winter when the government rolled out the booster programme in response to the huge surge in infections triggered by the Omicron variant. A small category of the public have been able to access a fourth dose since April, but - based on new research - it looks like this could be rolled out to more people in the autumn. Does a fourth dose increase protection? Yes - the results of a new UK trial, published in Lancet Infectious Diseases, revealed that two weeks after their fourth jab, the vaccines were 'well-tolerated' and 'boosted immunity' among the 133 study participants. Everyone in the study was vaccinated with either a dose of Pfizer or a half dose of Moderna approximately six months after their third jab. The study leader, Professor Saul Faust from the University of Southampton, said: 'We've demonstrated a fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccines can produce a substantial boost to both the antibody and cellular immunity when you give them more than six months after the third dose.' He continued: 'There was good boosting in all groups, particularly for the over-70s and the half dose of Moderna was slightly higher.'  There was a 1.6-fold increase in antibodies for those who received Pfizer and more than twofold increase for those who received the Moderna. 'Peak responses to the fourth dose were similar to, and possibly better than, peak responses after the third dose,' the experts also concluded. T-cells, an essential part of the immune system, were also boosted after the vaccine - suggesting long-term protection was increased alongside symptomatic infection, both in those over and under 70 years of age. Health secretary Sajid Javid said the study shows 'further evidence underlining the importance of people coming forward for their booster as soon as they are eligible'. Are there any downsides? Just like after the third dose, it appears that Covid antibodies wane quite quickly after injection. Prof. Faust also suggested that the surge of infections seen with the recent Omicron wave suggests most of the public will have been infected recently, and have high antibody levels - defeating the point of a fourth jab. He said those who had little waning of their immune responses before their fourth dose only saw a small increase in antibodies. He explained: 'That indicates there may be a ceiling, a maximum antibody level with the T-cell response effects.' Why can't everyone get a fourth dose now? Some nations - including Israel and Germany - have already rolled out a fourth dose. However, in the UK, the government will only make a decision based on the advice from the JCVI - Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. This independent panel identifies new variants of concern and potential pressure on hospitals. Downing Street has waited for the experts' nod before making a key move related to the vaccines, such as offering it to children, throughout the pandemic. So this particular study won't trigger an immediate response from Downing Street - especially as it only had a small number of participants. More research is needed to look at how the immune response fares over a longer time frame as well, before more people can access it. Who is currently eligible for a fourth dose? Adults aged 75 and over, along with residents in care homes for older adults and anyone aged 12 and over with weakened immune systems have been entitled to a fourth jab since April. Appointments can be booked three months after your previous dose, but the NHS recommends having the spring dose approximately six months later to maximise its effects. It has not yet been revealed who the government might extend the fourth jab to in the autumn. Should we keep getting boosters? Professor Danny Altmann, immunologist at Imperial College London, suggested that this new study shows how important it is to get another vaccine dose. He told The Guardian: 'Just because our first-generation vaccines wane rapidly and offer rather permeable protection nowadays, does not suggest we should give up and have no further boosters. 'On the contrary, many of us, even with high apparent antibody levels, actually show [little] protective neutralisation of Omicron, there is all the more urgency to use [fourth] doses - in all age groups - to boost levels back up into the protective range.' However, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol and a member of the JCVI, Adam Finn, suggested last month that anyone who is not yet middle-aged probably does not need a fourth dose. 'I think it's questionable whether young, healthy people will ever be offered another Covid vaccine beyond dose three - at least with the vaccines and variants we have now.' He added: 'You just don't achieve anything very useful by [further] immunising healthy young people with these vaccines because they rarely get sick - which the vaccines prevent.' Yet, he pointed out that this could all change in the future, if other more dangerous variants emerged. Vaccines also reduce long Covid symptoms, regardless of your age.",
    "aabd9f008f76a9816f5aa4d16373e1323190a8e0837b689a00039194": "Tesco's chairman has backed imposing a windfall tax on energy firms to help people who are feeling 'extremely stretched' by the cost of living crisis. John Allan said there was an 'overwhelming case' for a levy on the excess profits being enjoyed by companies as a result of the global spike in prices. The Labour Party has repeatedly called for a one-off tax on firms' profits to help ease the pressure on household bills, but Boris Johnson has repeatedly ruled it out, insisting it would prevent investment in green energy schemes. Last week Shell renewed demands for a windfall tax on the sector after it posted profits of PS7.2billion for the first three months of 2022. It followed BP, which announced an underlying profit of PS5bn earlier this month, more than double last year's figure and its biggest surplus in over a decade. Asked what he would like to see in the Queen's Speech, John Allan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'First of all, I think action to help people cope with a very, very sharp increase in energy prices. 'It's harder for people to mitigate energy than it is with food, and I think there's an overwhelming case for a windfall tax on profits from those energy producers fed back to those most in need of help with energy prices. 'I think that would be the single biggest thing that could be done.' Allan said he had also seen Tesco customers asking checkout staff to stop scanning their items once their bill had reached a certain threshold.  'I was hearing for the first time for many years of customers saying to checkout staff, 'stop when you get to PS40' or something,' he said.  'They don't want to spend a penny over that, as opposed to having everything checked out. 'So I think a lot of people are feeling, you know, something of a pinch and lots of people are actually feeling extremely stretched.' Chancellor Rishi Sunak recently told a Mumsnet event that while he was concerned a windfall tax could also put off investment in new oil and gas extraction, 'nothing was ever off the table'. But other ministers -- including business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and policing minister Kit Malthouse -- have voiced their opposition to the move. Malthouse told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday: 'We have to be very careful about the talk of windfall taxes. 'Don't forget these are global companies who make their money all over the world and pay tax all over the world, and we don't want to deter investment. 'They do already pay premium tax, double what other companies pay. 'And what we've seen over the last year or so, certainly, since the Ukraine crisis, is that we need investment in our domestic energy production, so we want to help them and stimulate them to do that.' However, Allan said he believed energy companies were 'expecting' to be taxed and said he did not believe 'they would actually be much fazed by it'.  Allan also took aim at the government's decision to increase national insurance by 1.25 percentage points, saying it was 'hitting people on modest incomes disproportionately and it's absolutely the wrong time to do it'. 'If I were in government, I'd roll that back.'",

Well, for legally blind unregistered barrister Haleemah Farooq, who was due to take professional pictures when she was called to the Bar after smashing her exams, the pictures looked a bit different.  The lawyer, 25, from Slough, posed with the cane that helps her get around, instead of the piece of paper. And when she shared the image on Twitter, it quickly went viral. Farooq, currently working for the Kent Police and Crime Commissioner as a casework officer before she secures pupillage (like a training contract), expressed what the cane meant to her. She wrote: 'This picture speaks volumes to me as a British Pakistani, blind Muslim woman. When taking the professional pictures at my Call ceremony I ensured that my white cane was in the photo because it is significant to my journey as a legally blind barrister.'  Since the image went viral, amassing more than 25,000 likes on Twitter, Farooq has even personalised her cane, adding pink florals to the item.  She tells HuffPost: 'It's tradition to hold the little fake degree thing and I chose not to do that in my individual picture, instead I held my white cane (it's now pink! I got it personalised recently but it's technically still called a white cane). 'It meant a lot to me to hold my cane.' Farooq struggled with the cane at first, as someone who is partially sighted, and was reluctant to use it. But recently, she began using it full-time and it's revolutionised her life. 'I have always been a confident person but have only recently started to use my white cane full time,' she added. 'Blind people use their cane for two reasons, identification or mobility. Although I would use my cane here and there, I was never confident enough to use it maybe because I never saw others who looked liked me growing up, being a British Pakistani blind hijabi and I was very conscious of the looks I used to get. 'But I soon learned that my cane is my eyes, my friend, my aid and it helps me on so many levels. So I started using my cane full time and given that it's empowered me beyond belief I thought it only right to let it shine with me in my professional photos.' For Farooq, being a Pakistani woman who wears a hijab and is now on her way to becoming a licensed barrister (once she secures pupilage), the moment is big for her for various reasons. 'I haven't seen much representation from others like me, but I don't mind being the first. I just hope that I can inspire other parents who think a disabled child can't achieve things,' she says.  'Though, I don't think I was doing anything amazing, I just like documenting my life so I'm happy it touched others.'",

After days of pressure and mounting questions, Starmer confirmed on Monday afternoon that he would step down as Labour leader if fined over a gathering he attended after campaigning in Durham last year.  The move has raised questions about whether Johnson -- who has already been fined by the Metropolitan Police -- would have to follow suit. But policing minister Kit Malthouse rejected suggestions that Starmer's decision would inevitably force Johnson's hand. Asked on LBC if the PM would have to resign if Starmer decided to quit, Malthouse said: 'Not necessarily, no. 'Obviously in any situation where, you know, the rules were moving around, there were misunderstandings or mistakes were made, and apologies are made and they are accepted, then people of all walks of life should be able to keep their jobs. 'But Keir Starmer has to speak for himself and set his own standards.' Malthouse later told the BBC's Today programme: 'As far as I'm concerned the rules were moving around, if mistakes were made, if apologies were made, I'm not sure that anybody be they so humble should lose their job over a fixed penalty notice. 'I don't know what Keir Starmer is attempting to do, whether he's attempting to turn what is obviously slightly a mysterious situation into a sort of political one, I don't know. 'In the end we have to leave space and time for Durham Police to do their job, which I know they'll do with professionalism and exactitude. And once they've reached their conclusion he can decide what he wants to do.' In his announcement, Starmer made it clear he believed 'no rules were broken' but promised to resign if Durham police chose to fine him for attending the gathering in April 2021. There have been mounting questions over the Labour leader's conduct after he was pictured drinking a beer after campaigning during last year's local elections.  It later came to light that a curry had also been ordered late at night and that up to 30 people may have been at the event, prompting Durham police to open an investigation.   At the time of the gathering, the ban on indoor mixing between households remained in place but there was an exemption for 'work purposes'.   Starmer has denied wrongdoing as he simply 'stopped for something to eat' during the working day. 'I am absolutely clear that no laws were broken,' he said. 'They were followed at all times. I simply had something to eat while working late in the evening as any politician would do days before an election. 'If the police decided to issue me with a fixed penalty notice I would course do the right thing and step down.'      ",

It's easier to get outside and go on walks, your skin looks better and you generally feel more alive. As our social lives slowly get back to normal, too, the sun is adding a big pep in our steps. But what is the science behind why it gives us that boost? What is it about the sunlight that makes our days feel more worthwhile? If you want to know why warm weather makes us so happy, keep reading. The sun is good for our mental health A lack of sun exposure has been linked to a drop in your serotonin levels, which can lead to depression during the winter time. The light-induced effects of serotonin are caused by sunlight that enters through the eye. This is why people often use light therapy treatments for seasonal depression. Sunshine is linked to better sleep Regularly exposure to sunlight promotes the production of melatonin which is the hormone that helps to regulate the body's sleep-wake cycle. This encourages the feeling of drowsiness, making us drift off easier at night while also making us happier in they day. Our circadian rhythm, the body's internal clock that signals when to be alert, is also regulated by melatonin, which can also make us happier.  The sun helps us build stronger bones Exposure to the ultraviolet-B radiation in the sun's rays causes our skin to create vitamin D, which plays a big role in building our bones.  A study found that in people wearing a swimsuit for 30 minute period, the following vitamin D levels were produced   50,000 international units (IUs) in most Caucasian people   20,000 to 30,000 IUs in tanned people   8,000 to 10,000 IUs in dark skinned people   Sunlight can help prevent cancer While it's important to use sun cream to protect your skin from harmful UV rays, a healthy amount of sunlight actually helps us avoid cancer. People who live in areas with a fewer daylight hours are more likely to have specific cancers than people who live in areas that have more sun during the day. These include colon cancer, Hodgkin's lymphona, ovarian, pancreatic and prostrate cancer.  The sun is good for our skin Have you noticed that your skin looks better in the sun? There's a reason for this. Exposure to the sun can help treat numerous skin conditions, according to the World Health Organistion (WHO), including psoriasis, eczema, jaundice and acne. Don't forget to wear SPF, of course, but it's good to know, huh? Happier skin, happier you.",
    "6eeea121ac2b0868a95d2ed7870ee7691f846d34ea53acc007dbf52e": "Prince Harry showed off his acting chops -- and his 'Girl Dad' T-shirt -- in a new video campaign for his nonprofit travel organisation Travalyst.  The nearly five-minute video promoting sustainable travel for New Zealanders lightheartedly offers the idea that holiday destinations rate travellers -- instead of the other way around.  In the YouTube video released on Monday, the Duke of Sussex stars alongside New Zealand actors Rhys Darby, Dave Fane and Rena Owen. At the start of the clip, the royal is seen running through the woods before he's stopped by a 'ratings agent' from New Zealand. Harry is questioned about a lollipop wrapper he allegedly dropped in 2018, when he and Meghan Markle were visiting the country on a royal tour.  The agent goes over a pretty personal rating system for the duke, praising him for using only one towel during a hotel stay and for not running water while he brushes his teeth. The revelations prompt a bewildered Harry to question the agent: 'How do you know that? That's really weird.' Later, after a second agent arrives and they discover a mix-up -- they were supposed to stop Harry Styles instead of the prince -- the royal's forearm is stamped with four stars.  In a statement shared with HuffPost, the duke talks about the 'opportunity and a need to redefine the industry -- for better, for good' as travel recovers amid the ongoing pandemic.  'We created the nonprofit Travalyst to rethink how travel can continue to expand our global understanding, to break down barriers, and to create cultural connections through experiences we otherwise wouldn't have,' Harry says in the statement.  'We do this while, at the same time, ensuring local communities truly feel benefit from tourism and safeguarding essential ecosystems. In a world where we're tasked with rating so many things, we're now asking: what if your destination rated you?'  The Duke of Sussex exclusively premiered the campaign on the Maori Television show 'Te Ao with Moana.'  Harry launched his initiative promoting sustainable travel in 2019, alongside partners Booking.com, Skyscanner, Trip.com Group, Tripadvisor and Visa. Google and Expedia recently joined the efforts, which aim to 'empower travellers to make better choices for themselves and the planet.'  The duke will soon be traveling himself. A spokesperson recently confirmed to HuffPost that Harry and Meghan will return to the UK for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations next month. The couple will be joined by their two children, Archie and Lili. Lili, who was born in June 2021, has yet to meet her great-grandmother in person.  The news of the Sussexes joining in the celebrations followed Buckingham Palace's announcement that the couple would not be included at the annual Trooping the Colour balcony appearance.  'After careful consideration, the Queen has decided that this year's traditional Trooping the Colour balcony appearance on Thursday 2nd of June will be limited to Her Majesty and those members of the Royal Family who are currently undertaking official public duties on behalf of the Queen,' the palace said in a statement shared with HuffPost on Friday. The announcement means that Prince Andrew, who also is not a working royal, won't join the royal family on the balcony, either. Andrew fell into disgrace from his association with the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

The presenter of the BBC podcast You, Me And The Big C said the last six months have been 'heartbreaking' to go through, but that she has been surrounded by 'so much love' and has 'no regrets'. Deborah was diagnosed with the condition in 2016 and since then has kept her nearly 300,000 Instagram followers up to date with her treatments, with candid posts about her progress and diagnosis. On December 14 2021, she marked five years since her diagnosis, writing on Instagram: 'I'm fully aware I shouldn't be alive to write this today.' But in a new post on Monday, she said: 'The message I never wanted to write. We have tried everything, but my body simply isn't playing ball. 'My active care has stopped and I am now moved to hospice at home care, with my incredible family all around me and the focus is on making sure I'm not in pain and spending time with them. 'Nobody knows how long I've got left but I'm not able to walk, I'm sleeping most of the days, and most things I took for granted are pipe dreams.' She added that she had left 'no stone unturned' in search of treatment, but that even a 'magic new breakthrough' would not make a difference. The former deputy headteacher announced in her post that she is setting up the Bowelbabe Fund, and shared links to charities including Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. She wrote: 'All I ask, if you ever read a column, followed my Instagram, listened to the podcast or saw me dressed as a poo for no reason, please buy me a drink to see me out this world, by donating the cost to @bowelbabefund which will enable us to raise funds for further lifesaving research into cancer. To give more Deborah's more time!'. She added: 'Right now for me it's all about taking it a day at a time, step by step and being grateful for another sunrise. 'My whole family are around me and we will dance through this together, sunbathing and laughing (I'll cry!!) at every possible moment! 'You are all incredible, thank you for playing your part in my journey. 'No regrets. Enjoy life x Deborah.'

You don't want to disrespect them by saying the wrong name, but just saying 'hey' seems so generic. Do you come clean about your memory lapse? Here's how experts say you can address the conundrum strategically and still keep your relationships intact. You may consider a subtle approach first If you are at an event and you see someone you know but you can't remember their name, introduce yourself first, because it often prompts that person to say their name too. That's what Mary Abbajay, president of the leadership development consultancy Careerstone Group, recommends. 'That is a signal for you to say your name back,' Abbajay says. But don't think you are being sly about your strategy. Many people will recognise that it means you don't know their name, she says.  One other indirect approach is to discreetly ask someone else to tell you the other person's name, Abbajay adds. If you are in a conversation that will continue later, consider asking the person to put their contact information in your phone. Or if the conversation needs to move to email, try asking, 'Can you tell me how to spell your name to get the email right?' suggests Perpetua Neo, a psychologist and executive coach. Better yet, ask them directly and apologise.  Avoiding saying someone's name every time you see them will only get you so far. 'I think people fake it too long, and then they meet that person three or four times, and then they are too embarrassed to ask their name,' Abbajay says. 'The best thing is to nip that in the bud right away. The second time you meet them, say, 'Remind me of your name again. Thank you so much.'' Don't minimise your actions and say, 'Oh I do this all the time.' If this is your third or fourth time asking their name, that deserves a bigger mea culpa, Abbajay says. People's names are important to them, and you want your apology to come across as sincere.  Don't make it too big a deal, though, either.  'We feel an internal pressure to remember people's names after they tell us once, but that's not fair, and truly, most people understand that,' says Lawrese Brown, the founder of C-Track Training, a workplace education company. 'Even if it's a close colleague, some of us are better with names than others and some of us forget things easily in general.' 'The biggest mistake is to be overly apologetic like there is something wrong with you,' Neo says. 'Being gracious and pleasant about it can be useful.' Don't get discouraged if it happens more than once. Learning names takes time, Brown says, but what pushes her to ask for name reminders is to remember there are worse alternatives: You can make the wrong guess and call that person by an incorrect name, or you can be impersonal and never say their name. 'In the short term, asking may feel embarrassing, but that's a temporary feeling,' Brown says. 'The feeling of letting someone know that you care enough to call them by their name is what they'll remember.' Write down names whenever possible and try saying a person's name when you first meet them. Brown says that writing down someone's name is what works best for her as far as remembering them. Research has shown that writing things down helps our brains really retain what is being said. A 2014 study in Psychological Science, for example, found that students who wrote notes down on paper had better comprehension and retention of what was being taught than students typing on their laptops.  If you don't have access to a pen or paper, try using your voice. Here's a pro tip: Use someone's name within the first minutes of meeting someone. Abbajay says that in meetings she facilitates, she will ask people to introduce themselves even if some people already know each other as a way to help her remember names. When people introduce themselves, she diagrams where they are sitting and what their names are. That way, 'When I'm in the meeting, I can start using people's names. If you use somebody's name quickly when you meet them, chances are you are going to remember their name,' she says. ",

In the address, the Queen is tasked with setting out the government's plans for new laws in the next session of what is supposed to be a five-year parliament. On Tuesday, Buckingham Palace announced that the 96-year-old Queen would not attend and Prince Charles would assume her duties, including reading out the agenda-setting speech. What is the Queen's speech? The Queen's speech sets out the government's priorities for the coming session of parliament, outlining proposed policies and legislation. The address is delivered by the monarch during the state opening of parliament, a ceremonial event which marks the formal start of the parliamentary year. It is important to note that the Queen does not write the speech. The Queen remains politically neutral and above party politics so the speech is written by government minsters.  The speech is read out by the Queen in the House of Lords, and typically lasts just a few minutes. The event is perhaps best known around the world for its pomp and ceremony. The Queen travels to parliament in a state coach, escorted by mounted soldiers in ceremonial uniform. The imperial state crown and other regalia travel ahead in a carriage of their own. The monarch puts on the robe of state before leading a procession to the Lords, where she sits on a throne and formally opens the new session of parliament by reading out the speech. Why won't the Queen be there?  Buckingham Palace said on Monday that the Queen's son and heir, Prince Charles, will carry out the duty on behalf of the Queen. He will be accompanied by his eldest son, Prince William. It is the latest event the Queen will not attend because of her health. She has been forced to cut back on engagements since being hospitalised for a night last October for an unspecified illness, and then being told by her doctors to rest. Queen Elizabeth II, the world's eldest and longest-reigning monarch, has continued to carry out many of her duties virtually. Her first public event since falling ill was in April, when she attended a memorial service to her late husband, Prince Philip, who died last year. The monarch 'reluctantly' pulled out of the occasion as she continues to experience 'episodic mobility problems' with royal doctors advising her against attending, the Palace said. A new letters patent authorised by the Queen was issued to cover the state opening, delegating to counsellors of state the royal function of opening a new session of parliament. In this instance, it enables Charles and William to jointly exercise that function.  Prince Charles already takes the place of the Queen at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday, the annual event commemorating Britain's war dead. He has also supported her at the state opening of parliament since the retirement of Prince Philip in 2017.  Has she missed the ceremony before? It is the first time in nearly 60 years that the Queen will miss the state opening.  She was pregnant with Prince Andrew in 1959 the first time she missed the event took, and again just before Prince Edward's birth in 1963. On those occasions the Lord Chancellor read the speech on her behalf. What will be in the Queen's Speech? The government is expected to use the speech to bring forward changes to Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trading arrangements, alter laws the UK inherited from the European Union after Brexit, and replace the human rights act with a British bill of rights. A range of new education policies, a levelling up and regeneration bill and plans to privatise Channel 4 are also expected to be included. It is unclear whether more powers for a watchdog to regulate tech giants like Facebook and Google will be in the speech.",
    "28f966fcb3d9de0bd06b9d76122a400122de25ca9b4393a74dd97ddc": "Keir Starmer has pledged to resign should police fine him for breaking lockdown rules. The Labour leader is under investigation for a gathering in Durham in April 2021, where he was pictured drinking a beer. At the time, the ban on indoor mixing between households remained in place. But there was an exemption for 'work purposes'. Starmer has denied wrongdoing as he simply 'stopped for something to eat' during the working day. But if he does end up quitting, what happens next? To put it bluntly, Labour would need a new leader. Labour leadership rules If a Labour leader quits, a contest for their replacement is automatically triggered. Under party rules passed at Labour's last conference, candidates need the support of 20% of Labour MPs to get onto the ballot. There are 199 Labour MPs, which means candidates need 39 to nominate them. Starmer had initially proposed an even more radical change to the rules which included a 25% threshold of support from MPs. But he was forced to water down his proposals amid opposition from the left and the unions. Previously, including when Starmer was elected leader, candidates only needed 10% of MPs. Raising the threshold was seen as a move by Starmer's allies to lock leftwing MPs out of ever making it onto the ballot again in the wake of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. As well as winning the support of 20% of MPs, candidates need to be nominated by at least 5% of Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs) or at least three affiliates (two of which must be trade unions). Groups affiliated to Labour include the Labour Women's Network, LGBT Labour and BAME Labour. Unions include the GMB, Unison and Unite. For example, in the 2020 leadership contest, Starmer was nominated by the Usdaw and Unison unions and the affiliated environment campaign group Sera. Candidates who make it onto the ballot then go to a vote of party members, on a one member one vote basis. Under the rule changes agreed last year, members also now have to been signed up for six months to be allowed to vote in leadership contests. The 'registered supporters' scheme which allowed non-members to pay PS25 to vote in the 2020 contest has also been axed. In 2015, when Corbyn won the leadership, people could pay just PS3 to have a vote. The system was widely seen as handing Corbyn an advantage as non-members signed up in order to help him win the leadership. Who are the candidates?  Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, is probably seen as the frontrunner in any contest. Having run in 2020, she told The House magazine last year: 'I don't have any intention of ever putting myself through that again.' But on Sunday she refused to rule out throwing her hat into the ring if Starmer quit. Angela Rayner, the party's deputy leader, might also fancy a tilt at the leadership. She decided not to run in 2020 and instead run for deputy, she supported Starmer's leftwing rival Rebecca Long-Bailey in the leadership contest. But Rayner was also present at the Durham event and if she is fined for breaking the rules she has, like Starmer, pledged to quit, which would probably rule her out. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, is also a likely candidate. The 39-year-old has had a rapid rise under Starmer and is widely expected to run for leader one day. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, ran for the leadership in 2015. She served in Gordon Brown's cabinet as work and pensions secretary. In opposition she chaired the home affairs committee before returning to the frontbench under Starmer in November last year. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, is also a potential candidate. He has been the MP for Tottenham since 2000 and held several ministerial jobs during the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments.  Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, is talked of as a future leader. The 38-year-old has been MP for Houghton and Sunderland South since 2010 and her election as leader would mark a new generation. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester, has made no secret of his desire to be party leader one day. After losing to Corbyn in the 2015 contest, Burnham quit parliament to run for mayor. While he is popular in the party he is unlikely to be able to mount a challenge as candidates have to be MPs. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, is also seen as keen to run for the leadership. But, like Burnham, is currently not an MP and barring a very convenient by-election in which he could stand, would be ineligible.",

The Queen will not attend the ceremony on Tuesday, Buckingham Palace confirmed, which sets out the government's policies and proposed legislation for the new session. The monarch 'reluctantly' pulled out of the occasion as she continues to experience 'episodic mobility problems' with royal doctors advising her against attending. The announcement marks a significant move towards the handing over of sovereign duties to Prince Charles.  The 96-year-old monarch has missed the ceremony only twice during her 70 years on the throne. The Palace said in a statement: 'The Queen continues to experience episodic mobility problems, and in consultation with her doctors has reluctantly decided that she will not attend the State Opening of Parliament tomorrow. 'At Her Majesty's request, and with the agreement of the relevant authorities, The Prince of Wales will read The Queen's Speech on Her Majesty's behalf, with The Duke of Cambridge also in attendance.' The first time she missed the event took place when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew in 1959 and just before Prince Edward's birth in 1963. On those occasions the Lord Chancellor read the speech on her behalf.  Prior to the event, Buckingham Palace drew up contingency plans for Prince Charles to read the speech amid concerns Her Majesty would be unable to attend. The palace had said she was aiming to deliver the speech but her attendance would only be confirmed on the day. For the past two state openings the Queen opted to travel to the Palace of Westminster by car, rather than carriage. In recent months the Queen has missed a number of engagements because of mobility problems, including the royal garden party season. Prince Charles already takes the place of the Queen at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday. He has also supported her at the State Opening of Parliament since the retirement of the Duke of Edinburgh in 2017. Many of the events involve standing for long periods which the Queen is no longer able to do.  It has raised questions about which events she will be able to attend as part of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations next month. ",
    "1141529a2a447e9f98a6665d90486929098cd54dda1d895daf09feb9": "Singer-songwriter Nick Cave has announced that his son Jethro Lazenby has died at the age of 31. In a statement issued to HuffPost UK on Monday afternoon, the Australian star said: 'With much sadness, I can confirm that my son, Jethro, has passed away. We would be grateful for family privacy at this time.' Jethro - a former actor, model and photographer, who sometimes used the moniker Jethro Cave - was born in Australia in 1991. He previously revealed that he did not meet his musician father until he was 'about seven'. Earlier this year, he was arrested and taken into police custody after a physical assault on his mother, Beau Lazenby, in Melbourne, Australia. His legal representative, Sean Ghattas, said Jethro had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which had affected his judgement. According to Metro, Jethro had been released from custody two days before his death, on the condition he undergo substance abuse treatment and not contact his mother for the next two years. The outlet also reported he was due to appear in court next month to receive sentencing for the assault. Jethro was previously sentenced to prison time in 2018 after assaulting his girlfriend. Nick lost another son, Arthur, in 2015 after he fell to his death from a cliff in Brighton when he was 15 years old. Last year, the singer revealed that he and his wife, model Susie Bick, had relocated to Los Angeles, stating that it had become 'too sad' for them to stay in Brighton. Speaking to The Guardian in 2017, Nick said of the grieving process: 'It's hard to know what to say that is helpful. People often say they can't imagine how it would feel to lose a child, but, actually, they can - they can imagine what it is like. 'A lot is said about grief, especially the conventional wisdom that you do it alone. I personally have found that not to be the case. The goodwill we received after Arthur's death from people who I did not know, especially through social media, people who liked my music and kind of reached out, was extraordinary.'",
    "90529c25c4e2d07b16d2c2309f4921bffe7828a07a29bfb19b7deda3": "Sinn Fein just won the most seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time in the devolved government's history - here's what it could mean for the country's future. What you need to know about Sinn Fein Sinn Fein's primary goal is to achieve a united Ireland. This would mean taking Northern Ireland out of the UK and making it one country again with the Republic of Ireland, a century after the island was first split into two. The party even refuses to use the term Northern Ireland, instead calling the country 'the North'. Once linked with the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Troubles - which gradually came to an end after the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 - Sinn Fein is often considered a divisive party because of its complicated history. Now, it strongly advocates for peace across Ireland, and many of its supporters are of a younger generation who do not remember the conflict of the Troubles. Why is the party's win significant? This is a seismic shift for Northern Irish politics because for the first 50 years of the country's existence, it was ruled exclusive by unionists. And ever since the Good Friday Agreement, the country has been led by a unionist politician. Why have they suddenly received so much more support? Although it is what Sinn Fein is most known for, the United Ireland argument was not centre stage throughout the party's election campaign. Instead, it was the cost of living crisis and a promise to help the general public. To counter their opponents, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) simply warned that a vote for Sinn Fein would lead to another referendum on Irish unity - even though that was barely in the party's manifesto. And it seems Irish unification is not a pressing matter right now for voters. A poll from the University of Liverpool's Institute of Irish Studies found that only 30% of Irish voters would vote for unity 'tomorrow'. Others have argued that it comes down to the DUP's disintegration over recent years, as the party has been split following the Brexit vote and the subsequent Northern Ireland Protocol, disliked by most unionists for separating the country from the rest of the UK. Sinn Fein did actually secure the same number of seats in 2022 and as they did in 2017. It's the DUP who have seen a decrease in support, having held onto 28 seats in 2017, before dropping to 25 this year. DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly even admitted: 'What we've seen is a fracturing of unionism - there hasn't been a dramatic change in the size of the vote.' What does all this mean for the Northern Ireland Assembly? The party ousted their unionist opponents, winning a total of 27 seats in the Assembly compared to the DUP's 25 in the election, making them the first nationalist party to have a majority in Stormont. However, Sinn Fein's victory does not mean that the party can already start governing independently - the power-sharing system in place in Northern Ireland means Sinn Fein has to govern with the DUP. Sinn Fein's vice-president Michelle O'Neill, who leads the party in Northern Ireland, can now take on the first minister role for the country but she cannot assume the position until the DUP appoint a deputy, who will actually be equal to her in status. They cannot hold office without the other, and the DUP is currently refusing to take its place in the Northern Ireland Assembly. What's the hold-up? The DUP says it will not nominate any ministers to Stormont until Westminster acts on the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is a fundamental part of the current Brexit arrangements, and was championed by Boris Johnson within his first months in office. It means Northern Ireland has to follow the trade rules of the EU, despite leaving the bloc along with the rest of the UK. It is still part of the UK but there are now checks on goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland. The protocol was meant to prevent Northern Ireland putting up a hard border with the Republic of Ireland - a problem which contributed to the past tensions in Ireland - as long as the north continued to follow EU regulations like its southern neighbour. However, Northern Ireland unionists think this setup undermines its position with the rest of the union, and claim that this is an 'existential threat' to the country's place in the UK. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the DUP, even withdrew Paul Givan as the first minister of Northern Ireland in February to protest the protocol. DUP MP Gavin Robinson said his party wants a functioning government but needs to prioritise the 'infectious nature of the protocol and the damage that it's doing'. It means the government is currently in a stalemate if the DUP does not nominate a deputy first minister. For now, the assembly goes on in a caretaker capacity and the ministers who were in their roles prior to the election stay on - the executive is made up of the first and deputy first ministers, along with eight others. This will go on for up to six months. After that, a new election could be called or the Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis will come up with an alternative. Does this mean there could be a united Ireland on the horizon? In short - no, not necessarily. The party has not proposed a border poll just yet, but said it is working towards a unity referendum within a 'five-year framework'. It's more likely this would be a key component of its future campaigns - to put forward a referendum in the years to come. It would also need Westminster government to approve it, which seems unlikely as Downing Street is keen to squash the separatist sentiment in Scotland right now. A border poll would also be necessary in the Republic of Ireland, where Sinn Fein is winning more votes than other parties too. The Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin said he was 'amused' by such a suggestion that a united Ireland could be on the cards. He told RTE's Morning Ireland: 'That was not the mandate sought by Sinn Fein in the last three weeks. 'The whole campaign was on cost of living, on health and on housing. 'The border poll was nearly buried from its documentation and its manifesto and, (as) soon as the votes are counted, it is brought back into centre stage.' Martin added: 'This was an election fought on current topical issues and, therefore, I think parties could lose out if they do not respond to what people said to them on the doorsteps.'",
    "d669eb71c617ec97f6426923d8d568ebdcce7d6bb9ed7952f820521f": "A Labour MP has spoken out about maternal loneliness and the mental health issues she suffered after giving birth to her first son.  Ellie Reeves said the birth was one of the 'best days of my life' but confessed that she struggled afterwards with feeling 'lonely and isolated'. The shadow justice minister argued society should be more willing to talk about the impact of childbirth and 'remove the stigma' of mental health.  Her eldest son was almost two-and-a-half years old when she was first elected to parliament in 2017. Reeves and her husband, fellow Labour MP John Cryer, welcomed their second son in the middle of the 2019 election campaign.  However, the former lawyer said she found her first pregnancy particularly 'hard and challenging' and that when he was born he did not sleep much and had feeding issues. In an interview with Gloria De Piero on GB News, she said: 'It was really, really hard and quite exhausting. And people don't talk about that side of things so much, but I think it's important to say that it isn't always easy.' When she went back to work, Reeves ended up creating a legal consultancy providing affordable advice to women facing maternity discrimination. However, she said the reality of working from home without colleagues was hard, adding: 'That's when I started to feel really quite lonely and isolated. Because I didn't have that routine of sort of going into work and interacting with people.' Asked if she was depressed, she replied: 'I don't know if I'd have met a clinical diagnosis for depression, I certainly didn't ask for help. But I certainly felt very lonely and isolated, and that had an impact on my mental health. I think the more isolated I became, the less I then started to go out and interact with other people. 'You sort of lose your confidence don't you, if you stop going out, you start to lose confidence in yourself and your ability to do all of that. And on the face of it, I had the successful business, nice home, beautiful baby boy. And it's really hard isn't it to say 'actually, I am struggling a little bit here'.' The MP for Lewisham West and Penge has previously spoken in parliament about suffering with prenatal depression which led to an exacerbation of anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. Asked about it, she replied: 'I felt very anxious about going out. I got very worried if I went out, what if something happened to me?  'I got really, really anxious and then it was sort of easier to spend most of my time at home and to withdraw a little bit. 'And then you get into that cycle of then not going out and then not interacting with people and withdrawing really, and I did that for quite a while.' She said society could help those feeling low by being more 'honest and open' about it. 'I think that as a society we need to be more willing to talk about these issues and actually to remove the stigma around mental health,' she said. 'With things like having a baby, it's such a massive change that it's probably quite normal for people to have some sort of mental health issues during that time. 'And rather than being like 'oh no we can't talk about it' actually we should be open and honest about it. 'And also, we need to make sure that the help is then there when people do ask for it. And, you know, I feel quite keenly that there needs to be adequate mental health provisions so that when people do ask for help, they get it.' Reeves said she did not think it would be difficult to ensure that all new mums received help and support that would make a 'huge difference'.",
    "996a108f38d30643ead540cd7ea67a283899ed9a0dd63325a7a3fcaa": "Some hay fever medicines are in short supply across the UK, which sounds like a nightmare scenario for those of us prone to itchy eyes, scratchy throats and headaches this time of year. But don't panic, there are other medications available. You might just struggle to get your hands on meds containing a key ingredient.  Stocks of chlorphenamine maleate, the active ingredient in brands such as Piriton, have been affected, although other hay fever medicines are available. A spokesperson for the pharmacy chain Boots said only four out of 90 hay fever products were affected and there was good availability of other hay fever items. 'There are a very small number of lines that are currently out of stock due to a current, industry-wide shortage of the active ingredient chlorphenamine maleate,' they said. 'However, we are expecting this to be resolved soon and new deliveries are expected in the coming weeks.' What alternative hay fever meds are available?  Other hay fever medicines such as Piriteze use cetirizine hydrochloride and are still in plentiful supply. Royal Pharmaceutical Society president Claire Anderson said: 'Chlorphenamine maleate is just one component of a few hay fever tablets, including Piriton, which is not a first line choice for treating hay fever for adults as it is more likely to make patients drowsy. 'Other medication using cetirizine hydrochloride or loratadine is still available widely in pharmacies across the country, and fexofenadine is also now available on general sale at pharmacies this year for the first time, so patients actually have more options than ever to treat their hay fever symptoms.' Why is there a shortage of chlorphenamine maleate? 'Medicines shortages are not a new problem, and is something pharmacists and pharmacy teams have to manage and deal with on a daily basis, and have done for a long time,' Anderson explained.  'This can be for a multitude of reasons, including manufacturing issues, global demand or disruption with the supply chain. Availability of certain medicines fluctuates, and it is important to ask your pharmacist for alternatives.' You might have also read news that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is currently being hit by supply shortages across the UK. While HRT is usually prescribed by a doctor, many hay fever medications are available over the counter.  'GPs, pharmacists and patient groups have called for pharmacists to be able to make minor changes to a prescription when something is out of stock - this should be considered as part of a package of measures to address future medicines supplies,' Anderson added.  What should you do if you can't access your usual medication?  If your go-to hay fever medication is out of stock, speak to your pharmacist about which alternatives may be suitable for you. The NHS also recommends the following tips for reducing the impact of hay fever symptoms:   Put Vaseline around your nostrils to trap pollen   Wear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into your eyes   Shower and change your clothes after you have been outside to wash pollen off   Stay indoors whenever possible   Keep windows and doors shut as much as possible   Vacuum regularly and dust with a damp cloth   Buy a pollen filter for the air vents in your car and a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter   Try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities.

Police in Durham announced last week that they will re-investigate claims that he broke covid lockdown laws in April, 2021, by having curry and beer with colleagues. Starmer has repeatedly insisted that no rules were broken because the meal took place during a work meeting, and that he and his staff went back to work again afterwards The Labour leader pulled out of a planned speech and question-and-answer session, which he had been due to make on Monday. According to The Times, Starmer is being encouraged by close colleagues to announce that should be be found to have broken covid rules by Durham Constabulary, he will resign. It is hoped that would heap pressure on Boris Johnson, who Starmer has called on to quit after he was issued with a fixed penalty notice for attending a birthday party in the Cabinet Office in June, 2020. One senior Labour source told HuffPost UK: 'He is more likely to go down that route than not. 'I suspect there has been quite a lot of discussion about it and ultimately his instinct is that his integrity is more important to him than anything else. 'The fundamental position is we don't think he has breached the rules and we're very confident about that. 'But in the end, he's been clear what the threshold for resigning is when it comes to the prime minister.' One supporter told The Times: 'There's a clear logic to it. It would give him something to say at the despatch box when Johnson raises it.' Earlier this morning, shadow health secretary Wes Streeting dismissed suggestions that Starmer will have to quit. He said: 'I just don't think that's going to happen, I'm not going to entertain that prospect.' On Sunday night, cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said he did not believe Starmer should have to resign even if he is fined. Many Tories fear that the prime minister will come under renewed pressure to quit if the Labour leader falls on his own sword. David Simmonds MP told other members of the Tories' 2019 intake in a WhatsApp group: 'The only 'good' outcome I can see is if Starmer is fined and doesn't resign. Any other outcome just makes us look worse by comparison.'",

The Labour leader said the idea he would 'casually break' Covid restrictions was 'wrong'. Labour hope the pledge will heap pressure on the prime minister, who Starmer has called on to quit after he was issued with a fixed penalty notice for attending a birthday party in the Cabinet Office in June, 2020.  Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, said as a former director of public prosecutions, Starmer would not have broken the law.   'He is Mr Rules, he does not not break the rules,' she told Sky News. 'It was not illegal to eat.'   And Wes Streeting, the shadow education secretary, also dismissed the allegations. 'Breaking news: Keir Starmer has dinner,' he said.  It is also possible Durham police conclude Starmer did break the rules but do not issued him with a fixed penalty notice (FPN), as the force has previously said it has a policy of not issuing 'retrospective' fines.   This was the case when it investigated Dominic Cummings' infamous trip to Barnard Castle.  ",
    "b1be884a404a37964458b71838ba8a172f3df8efc2e7f5ab8f46f91c": "The New York Times issued a statement Monday warning that the answer of the day on its popular online game Wordle might appear to be in bad taste for some users. The company said it usually separates its games content from its news content, but that Monday's Wordle answer (which, spoiler warning, appears below) broke that rule, and matched the week's news cycle a little too closely. 'Wordle continues to delight millions of people every day, but as we move it over to The Times's technology, we have continued to discover challenges,' wrote Everdeen Mason, the company's editorial director for Games. 'Today, for example, some users may see an outdated answer that seems closely connected to a major recent news event.' The event in question is last week's Politico scoop -- a leaked majority draft opinion showing the Supreme Court is preparing to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, stripping Americans off their constitutional right to access abortion. The word 'fetus' was selected and inserted into the system last year, well before the publication of the Supreme Court draft, which has turbocharged the national conversation around abortion. 'At New York Times Games, we take our role seriously as a place to entertain and escape, and we want Wordle to remain distinct from the news,' Mason wrote. Mason said the Times took action to change the word for as many users as possible last week, but those who hadn't refreshed their browser window since would still get the 'outdated' answer. The company bought the viral puzzle game, which gives users six attempts to guess a five-character word, from software engineer Josh Wardle in January. Over the weekend, activists gathered outside the homes of two conservative Supreme Court justices, Brett Kavanaugh and John Roberts, to protest the projected outcome of Roe being overturned. On Sunday, a fire broke out at the Wisconsin Family Action office, an anti-abortion facility in Madison, with the unknown vandals leaving a spray-painted message outside the building: 'If abortions aren't safe, then you aren't either.' Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers insisted Roe was unconstitutional and said they felt for pregnant women in a challenging situation. 'I'm empathetic to all these ladies who find themselves in very difficult times and very difficult decisions,' governor of Mississippi, Tate Reeves, told NBC's Meet The Press.",
    "f170345893e48ffa7c24748f2a378b4cfc7755baa3d5922a3159a5fb": "The Duchess of Cambridge, as you might have heard, is on the look-out for a new personal assistant to her Private Secretary. Kensington Palace said it is on the hunt for someone to support the Duchess of Cambridge in her official and charity work, providing a range of admin and operational support including organising travel, managing their diary, monitoring emails and taking minutes. The new person also needs to be a big fan of the Duchess's work.  The Palace is looking for someone with experience too, with the successful candidate showing previous secretarial and administrative responsibility, excellent IT skills and interpersonal skills and being good at organisation. And all that for...PS27,500. That might sound about right to some people, given how poorly Brits are paid in this country, but actually, it's below average.  And let's not forget, the work is for one of the richest and most powerful families in the world. So, PS27k doesn't actually sound like a lot. And Twitter is pointing it out.  How much is the average salary then, we hear you ask? Well, it's a little bit complicated at the moment due to Covid, as the pandemic made it somewhat difficult to collect data from businesses.  But according to the latest earnings analysis (2021) from the ONS, the average salary for full-time workers was PS31,285 (you might see figures floating around online between PS24-25k but these may be based on part-time salaries, after tax figures, and from bodies which collate their data differently - HMRC has different data, for example). You also have to consider how the average salary is impacted by region. London, for example, has higher earnings than other parts of the country. Don't forget that high-earning CEOs, executives and figures on six-figure salaries boost up the average. While it can vary from industry to industry, depending on level of seniority and experience, the median London earning according to some research is around PS39,716 (though some sources cite as high a salary as PS53,000). Some of the most common pay ranges in the capital are between PS32,000-PS36,000 and PS36,000 to PS39,000.  The cost of living is also higher here too, therefore the London living wage is applied to some roles. So given some of the high figures here, a pay of PS27k for a role that's sure to be stressful, potentially dangerous, and outside a traditional 9-5, seems rather low. And yes, the problem isn't exclusive to the Royal family and workers around the country are earning lower than the pay advertised by the Palace - but what does that say about our culture of work in the UK, when so many people are underpaid? Many of our European counterparts are excelling in this realm, paying their workers a decent wage while also ensuring excellent healthcare and education systems. We should rise to these standards as opposed to accepting menial pay for poor conditions.  Let's also not forget the squeeze that cost of living is having many of us. Which is why we need to demand more from our bosses, even if they may be royalty.",
    "3de73f610b1bec53780944860672a634e6f1199539ba92775ed06ba0": "Russia's ambassador to Poland was surrounded by a large crowd who threw fake blood at him while chanting 'fascists' and 'murderers' on Monday. Sergey Andreev was in Warsaw to pay respects to the Soviet soldiers who died during World War 2. His arrival coincided with the national holiday known as Victory Day, where Russians still celebrate defeating Nazi Germany to this day. Hundreds of protesters, furious at Russia's barbaric treatment of Ukraine, stood in Andreev's way of the memorial and snatched away the wreath of flowers he wanted to place at the cemetery, where more than 20,000 Red Army soldiers are buried. The activists trampled on the flowers, before dousing him in red paint from behind and beside him - some of his entourage were hit by the red liquid too. Some activists carried Ukrainian flags as they surrounded the ambassador, while others donned white sheets also smeared with red liquid. The demonstration clearly meant to symbolise the thousands who have died since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.  Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova hit out against the attack, declaring: 'Admirers of the neo-Nazis have once again shown their face.' She suggested that this assault reflected the 'course for the reincarnation of fascism', as did the removal of Soviet statues from around Europe which has occurred in the weeks since Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Zakharova promised on her messaging app channel that 'we won't be scared' but that the 'people of Europe should be scared to see their reflection in a mirror'. The Polish government has subsequently been criticised for not providing more security for the ambassador amid fears that the Kremlin might eject the Polish ambassador from Russia in return, while others saw Andreev's appearance in Warsaw as a provocation. Demonstrations in Warsaw have been building since the war broke out - on Sunday evening, activists parked outside the city's Russian Embassy with a tank carried by a tractor. This seemingly bizarre image has become a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance, as Ukrainian farmers have been pictured hauling off Russian tanks ever since war broke out. Andreev's decision to make such a gesture on Victory Day adds to the growing tensions between Europe and Russia.  Russian president Vladimir Putin furiously blamed the West for Russia's attacks on Ukraine during his Victory Day speech, by suggesting Western allies were looking to invade 'our land'. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also denounced Poland's politicians last week for being 'openly hostile' towards Russia. He even claimed that Poland 'may pose a threat to the territorial integrity of Ukraine'.",
    "ec8ca6250d86924088bda1a7bb6805af759126e299be8102c99c43a3": "Around one in 10 people in England allegedly have still not had Covid - and scientists now think this minority could pave the way to a cure for the deadly virus. Even though the highly transmissible Omicron variant that swept across the world towards the end of 2021 continues to be the dominant strain, there are people who have not tested positive throughout the whole pandemic. Scientists are now looking to study this small demographic to see if their genes might help future treatment - or even prevent Covid infection altogether. Andras Spaan, a clinical microbiologist from the Rockefeller University in New York, is leading the hunt into what might cause this Covid resistance, with a particularly focus on their genetic material. He told the Washington Post: 'What we are looking for is potentially very rare genetics variants with a very big impact on the individual.' He is leading the international study, which already has 700 participants. Scientists are also screening more than 5,000 additional people who believe they could be immune to the virus. Health workers, who went without face masks during the height of the pandemic and still managed to test negative for Covid on a weekly basis, are among those who are being examined for signs of immunity. So how many people still haven't caught Covid? Journalist John Burn-Murdoch released a graph for the Financial Times last week explaining that - based on data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) - nine out of 10 people in England have tested positive for Covid at some point in the pandemic. Positive cases are falling at the moment, but the number of infections has fluctuated throughout the pandemic, according to which variant is spreading around and how up-to-date the general population is with its vaccination. Still, even as some people have reported catching Covid multiple times, there is still a category who believe they have not caught the virus at all. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention believes that six in 10 people across the States have had Covid at some point, at least once. According to data website Staista.com, there have been almost 514 million Covid cases as of May 1, 2022 - which certainly makes the people who have avoided it an anomaly. What could make some people Covid immune? Experts speculate that some people just might have fewer receptors in their noses, throats and lungs meaning the virus finds it harder to bind to their bodies. Alternatively, this minority could have previously been exposed to a similar virus which gave their immune systems a leg-up against Covid. They may have also been born with a particular immune system already equipped to fight the virus, making it a genetic issue. If scientists are able to find out why this small category of people have not been infected, both public health advice and Covid drugs could be significantly improved. It might even help protect the general population against future strains of the virus, which are expected. However, individual use of masks, vaccines, and social distancing might affect the study's ability to find those who are immune. Frequent testers, those who wear masks indoors and avoid high-risk gatherings or travel obviously decreased their risk of catching the virus through their decisions. This means it was not so much to do with their genetics or immune system, but their approach to the pandemic. Bob Wachter, professor and chair of the department of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, also told the Washington Post: 'It's got to be a combination of caution, circumstance and luck.'",
    "2f5f7f06f3bcf7dee7851902f453e9e77ddc8675590f29dd4546c7ca": "Keir Starmer made a lot of political capital out of revelations that Boris Johnson broke lockdown rules, with Labour enjoying a consistent poll lead over the Conservatives thanks to the partygate affair. The Labour leader heaped scorn on the prime minister and has demanded he resign after being fined by police. But now Starmer is under intense pressure himself after police announced they had launched an investigation into whether he also broke the law.  Durham Constabulary previously said they believed no offence was committed. But the case has now been reopened following repeated calls from the Conservative Party.  The row, dubbed 'Beergate', has overshadowed Labour's gains in last week's local elections and could yet lead to Starmer having to resign. What is the accusation? Starmer is accused of breaking lockdown rules on April 30, 2021, by eating a curry and drinking beer indoors with Labour staff in the constituency office of City of Durham MP Mary Foy. He was in the city campaigning in the run up to last year's local elections which took place on May 6. At the time, the ban on indoor mixing between households remained in place. But there was an exemption for 'work purposes'.  Starmer's critics have seized on a report in the Mail on Sunday as proof the gathering was an illegal social gathering rather than work. The paper published an internal Labour op-note which showed an hour and 20 minutes had been set aside for 'dinner' at Durham Miners Hall, after which the visit was due to end. Op-notes are memos used to set out the timings and location of events and are part of day-to-day political logistics.   Separately, the Sunday Times quoted an eyewitness present at the event who insisted no work was done after the meal.    What is the defence? Starmer has strongly denied he broke the law as he simply 'stopped for something to eat' and then continued to work. His allies have argued the Mail on Sunday memo actually proves the meal was included as part of Starmer's working day.  And while the op-note does suggest the leader's day ended after he had finished eating, it does not mean no further work was actually done. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, said as a former director of public prosecutions, Starmer would not have broken the law. 'He is Mr Rules, he does not not break the rules,' she told Sky News. 'It was not illegal to eat.' Wes Streeting, the shadow education secretary, also dismissed the allegations. 'Breaking news: Keir Starmer has dinner,' he said. What happens next? Starmer being under investigation by the police has effectively neutered his ability to attack the prime minister for breaking the rules. Johnson could very well be fined again in the coming weeks for taking part in Downing Street parties. But it will be hard for Starmer to make any political capital out of it. If Starmer is cleared, he will be able to return to making the case that while he followed the rules the PM did not, even if the waters have been muddied somewhat. But if he is fined, the pressure on him to resign will be huge given he has called on Johnson to do the same. It is also possible Durham police conclude Starmer did break the rules but do not issued him with a fixed penalty notice (FPN), as the force has previously said it has a policy of not issuing 'retrospective' fines. This was the case when it investigated Dominic Cummings' infamous trip to Barnard Castle. What do voters think? According to a YouGov poll released on Monday, almost half, 46 per cent, of British voters think Starmer should resign if he is fined by the police, compared to 32 per cent who think he should not. But the proportion of Labour voters who think he should quit in that situation, 48 per cent, is actually lower than the proportion of Tory voters, 40 per cent. This is compared to the 57 per cent of voters who believe Johnson should resign for his rule-breaking. But while Conservative voters are more forgiving of Starmer than Labour voters, only 29 per cent of Tories think the PM should have quit. In the court of public opinion, will voters really forgive the Labour leader if he does not practice what he has preached? That is the dilemma that Starmer and his team are currently wrestling with as they decide what to do next.",

Lee and Jenny have become one of the hit Channel 4 show's most popular pairings, offering their critiques on the week's telly from the sofa in Lee's caravan since 2014. However, some viewers were disappointed last week to discover the duo were absent from the latest episode of the current series. Speaking to the Daily Star at the TV Baftas, he revealed his friend has been 'not very well' in recent times, saying: 'She is having an operation, a mini one. But she is recovering well, though.' Lee added that Jenny had been invited to join him at the TV Baftas, but couldn't make it as the awards show clashed with her hospital appointment. 'You can't turn down an NHS operation down, can you?' he added. 'But she is doing well.' During Sunday night's ceremony, Gogglebox was nominated for Best Reality And Constructed Factual, which it won for the second time, beating Married At First Sight UK, RuPaul's Drag Race UK and Channel 4's The Dog House. Lee was among those to take to the stage to accept the award, alongside Gogglebox's creators and producers. Other winners on the night included Motherland, Ant And Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and Coronation Street, while there was outcry from some viewers when It's A Sin failed to pick up a single award despite seven nominations.

But instead of celebrating the star's news, some viewers of the reality show expressed confusion and even concern about the budding romance - and the reactions speak volumes about the scrutiny queer relationships still face.  During the show's reunion episode, Chrishell revealed that she's dating Australian singer G Flip.  'You don't get to choose where you meet someone. You don't get to choose when you meet someone in their life,' the real estate agent said. 'So recently, I've met someone that is in a different place in their life as well. I recently have been spending a lot of time with someone that's very important to me. Their name is G Flip. 'They're non-binary, so they go by they/them [pronouns], and they are an extremely talented musician.' Cue a lot of people questioning whether or not Chrishell still wants kids.  If you're a fan of the show, you'll remember Chrishell and her boss/boyfriend Jason Oppenheim broke up because he decided he didn't want children. But - and we can't believe this actually needs pointing out - there's nothing to say Chrishell, 40, can't still have kids in the future, either on her own or with 27-year-old G Flip, if that's what they wanted.   'I'm open to adoption, things like that,' Chrishell confirmed.  It seems the general public still needs some education about the many ways you can create a family in 2022.  The word 'rebound' has also been thrown about a lot in relation to their coupling up, alongside comments such as Chrishell 'needs to be single for a while' and remarks that she 'needs therapy'.  Would the reaction have been judgement-free if she'd announced a fling with a cisgender man? It's hard to say. But it wouldn't have been this queerphobic.  Sexuality aside for a moment, the idea that she's moved on 'too quickly' still smacks of slut-shaming. Even if this is a rebound, is a rebound so bad if all parties are enjoying some low-commitment fun? Clearly, Selling Sunset's fanbase need a tutorial or two on sex positivity. And we're hoping G Flip makes an appearance in the next series to deliver. ",

Eight climate campaigners from the group Green New Deal Rising called for Patel to drop the home office's divisive plans to send asylum seekers who arrive to the UK via so-called 'illegal means' off to Rwanda. One after another, the activists stood up and criticised the home secretary - before being escorted out by security.  'Priti Patel, your racist policies are killing people,' the first demonstrator began, just as the home secretary started her speech. Those attending the Bassetlaw Conservative Association Spring Dinner began to boo the activists, and shout, 'out out out' - but the demonstrators continued unperturbed.  'Your plans to send seeking asylum to Rwanda, are inhumane and are going to ruin people's lives,' the protester said before being carried out by plain-clothed guards. Another person immediately stood up and said: 'Priti Patel, as a young person who wants to live in a fair and compassionate society, we are disgusted by your treatment of refugees in the UK.' The protesters continued to jump up from various places around the room, each picking up from where the last person finished. The next person cried: 'At every opportunity, we will stand against your cruel plans and stand with migrants, refugees and people seeking asylum. ' 'We want to live in a just and fair society that cares and respects people, wherever they come from,' an activist standing on a chair shouted over the rebuttals from the other attendees. 'We want to be open and welcoming and tackle these crises in a just a way.' Another person said: 'Priti Patel, we demand you drop your racist and problematic Rwanda migration policy. We demand that you treat people of this world fairly, and you treat them with respect. 'Whether you're from Rwanda, wherever you're from, you deserve to be treated with respect!' The protester continued shouting even as he was dragged out of the venue. A chorus then began among the remaining activists: ''Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here.' The one-minute video, shared on social media by the social justice group, then stops as all the demonstrators are pushed outside of the room. Writing for The Guardian on Monday, Green New Deal Rising organiser Holly Hudson explained that the climate activists confronted the home secretary because housing refugees amid soaring global temperatures are connected. 'Many of the crises in the global south are the direct result of centuries of colonial exploitation by wealthy countries such as the UK. We believe it is the responsibility of our government to provide safety for people facing these situations. The 'Rwanda plan' and the nationality and borders bill must continue to be challenged and scrutinised in parliament and in public.' The activist added: 'No matter what the repercussions, history shows that if enough of us stand up and say, 'No more', we can make a difference.' The group is known for targeting politicians to put pressure on the establishment related to the climate crisis and to pressing social issues. Patel's offshoring plan was announced in April, and is already facing legal challenges, as the government has openly admitted. Downing Street has since confessed that it might take several months before anyone is even sent to Rwanda, although it maintains: 'Our new Migration and Economic Development Partnership with Rwanda fully complies with international and national law.'",

The former Strictly champion, who announced in March that he was quitting the BBC dance show, has been taking acting lessons and auditioning for roles in an attempt 'to get his foot in the door' of Hollywood. The Slovenian dancer had been on Strictly for nine years, and news of his exit came less than a year after his wife, fellow dancer Janette Manrara, stepped down from the show to become the co-host of spin-off It Takes Two. Aljaz told Hello magazine: 'Being a couple on Strictly gave us an edge and I feel like it can be exactly the same when it comes to, potentially, one day being on a different kind of TV programme together.   'I've had an incredible nine years on Strictly and have felt so lucky to be there, but it felt like the right time to take a risk and open myself up to new challenges. 'I want to try other things like film, TV and radio while I'm still young enough and my body is 100% capable. 'I'm just a fan of the craft and am trying to get my foot in the door. 'Do I want to go to Hollywood? Of course! If I didn't dream big I would never have ended up on Strictly.'   Janette added: 'I already imagine him as a Hollywood leading man, he definitely has what it takes and he has always been my Prince Charming.' In his Strictly debut series, Aljaz clinched the prize with model and TV presenter Abbey Clancy during the first all-female final on the show. In 2017, he reached the final with partner Gemma Atkinson but missed out to winners Joe McFadden and Katya Jones. Speaking about his decision to leave the show, he said: 'Janette and I were a team and helped choreograph each other's routines and every time I needed a shoulder or a hug she was there. 'But last year was different because, for the first time ever, I felt like I was doing Strictly on my own.' Janette added: 'The day he made the announcement we were literally holding hands with tears in our eyes because it was a bittersweet feeling. 'We always say it was never a Strictly curse for us, it was always a blessing and the best thing for us - in our marriage, in our careers and everything.' The couple said they would like to present a TV show together, inspired by husband and wife duo Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford.",

It's A Sin debuted in January 2021, telling the story of a group of friends living through the AIDS crisis in the late 1980s and early 90s. The show was met with a wave of acclaim, which eventually included an impressive seven nominations at the TV Baftas, more than any other show. Cast members Olly Alexander, Lydia West, Omari Douglas, Callum Scott Howells and David Carlyle all received recognition for their performances in It's A Sin, while the show itself was also in the running for Best Mini-Series. A scene in which Colin discovered he had AIDS was also nominated in the Must-See TV Moment category. However, during Sunday night's ceremony, It's A Sin didn't pick up any of the awards it was nominated for, which has not gone down well with its loyal fans: Many viewers were also confused by the fact that clips of It's A Sin used during the ceremony appeared to be muted: The acting prizes the It's A Sin cast lost out on went to Matthew MacFadyen for Succession, Jodie Comer for Help and Sean Bean for Time, which was also the recipient of the Best Mini-Series award. Meanwhile, Rose Ayling-Ellis and Giovanni Pernice's 'silent' routine from this year's Strictly Come Dancing was named Must-See TV Moment, the only award voted for by members of the public. It's worth noting that It's A Sin did win in the Best Director: Fiction category at the Bafta TV Craft Awards, which took place last month. The show was also named Best New Drama at last year's National Television Awards, as chosen by the public.",

In a speech on Monday morning, the defence secretary accused leaders of Russia's armed forces of 'amorality and corruption'. And he condemned the 'unprovoked, illegal, senseless and self-defeating' invasion of Ukraine. It came as Putin used a speech in Moscow marking Russia's Victory Day holiday to claim the war was necessary to ward off 'an absolutely unacceptable threat just next to our borders'. He has repeatedly alleged that Ukraine was planning to attack Russia - which Kyiv has flatly denied. 'The danger was rising by day,' he said, adding that 'Russia has pre-emptively repulsed an aggression'. Putin again scolded the West for failing to heed the Russian demands for security guarantees and a rollback to Nato's expansion, arguing that it also left Moscow no other choice but to invade. But he did not give any signal as to the next phase of the conflict. In his speech, Wallace said: 'Through the invasion of Ukraine, Putin, his inner circle, his generals, are now mirroring fascism and tyranny 77 years ago, repeating the errors of the last century's totalitarian regimes. 'Their unprovoked, illegal, senseless and self-defeating invasion of Ukraine, their attacks against innocent civilians on their homes, their widespread atrocities, including the deliberate targeting of women and children. 'They all corrupt the memory of past sacrifices and Russia's once proud global reputation. He added: 'The response to this failure by the Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine has in itself been a disgraceful display of self-preservation, doubling down on failure, anger, dishonesty and scapegoating.' The most intense combat in recent days has taken place in eastern Ukraine, as Russia seeks to capture the crucial southern port city of Mariupol.",

The actor first found fame as tough cop George Carter in The Sweeney opposite John Thaw and later went on to star in the hugely successful series, Minder. A statement from his family said: 'We are deeply saddened to announce that our beloved Dennis, passed away very peacefully in hospital in Spain, on Sunday afternoon, with Pam by his side. 'The family kindly ask that our privacy is respected at this very difficult time.' Little Britain star Matt Lucas was one of the first to pay his respects, with others sharing their own tributes on Twitter... Dennis played Gerry Standing in the BBC's New Tricks, and throughout his career other TV roles included ITV's Where The Heart Is, The Canterbury Tales and Moses Jones, both for the BBC. He became well-known for singing the theme songs to many of his shows, and was caricatured by David Walliams in Little Britain as a result. His last film role was in Never Too Late in 2020, which was filmed in Australia. Born in London, he was educated at the Corona Theatre School, and began his showbiz career at a young age, and following a role for the Children's Film Foundation, was invited to join Stratford's Royal Shakespeare Company. A role in the BBC's adaptation of the Just William books followed, and the actor would, in his later years, reflect on some of the different roles he undertook. In 2009, he starred in the BBC's hard-hitting drama Moses Jones, a role which he said at the time, he enjoyed because it cast him in a different light. 'I really enjoyed it, because it was a very different kind of character - and that's important. On television in Britain, I'm sort of the cheeky chappie, everybody's mate, but I've never played anything like that in the theatre. It's strange that you get cast as different things in different parts of the media,' he told PA at the time. His role in 2004's drama New Tricks marked his return to a long-running show for the first time in a decade and saw him star alongside acting stalwarts James Bolam and Alun Armstrong. His character Gerry was part of the cold case squad, who were often at odds with their detective boss, played by Amanda Redman. He had been married several times, including to the actress Rula Lenska until 1998, and his daughter, Hannah, became a TV star in her own right - landing a role in EastEnders as Laura Beale. Dennis' extensive career also included numerous stints on the stage and he played Alfred Doolittle in a Royal National Theatre production of My Fair Lady, as well as starring in a tour production of Don't Dress For Dinner. He also starred in productions of Twelfth Night, Edward Bond's Saved at the Royal Court Theatre and Sergeant Musgrave's Dance. The BBC's chief content officer, Charlotte Moore, issued a statement on behalf of the corporation, saying: 'We are incredibly sad to hear of the passing of Dennis Waterman, an unforgettable actor who will be missed by us all. Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.' His talents did not end with acting and he had a keen interest in music, having recorded albums and singles, including songs which charted in Australia, New Zealand and Britain.",

The Baywatch star said it had been a 'challenging few months' in an Instagram post she shared on Mother's Day. 'On this Mother's Day we can't help but reflect on these last few months and the rollercoaster we've been on, which we now know, so many people have also experienced,' she captioned the picture. 'After 100 plus days in the NICU, our little girl is finally home. 'Every family's journey is unique and requires a certain level of faith, and while ours was a challenging few months, what becomes abundantly clear, in retrospect, is how precious and perfect every moment is.' In the photo, Priyanka holds Malti against her chest as her singer husband holds the baby's hand. 'Our next chapter begins now, and our baby is truly a badass. Let's get it MM! Mommy and Daddy love you,' she wrote.  'Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers and caretakers in my life and out there. You make it look so easy. Thank you.' She added: 'Also.. there is no one I'd rather do this with than you. Thank you for making me a mama @nickjonas I love you.' The couple also took the opportunity to thank the doctors and nurses at Rady Children's Hospital, La Jolla and Cedars-Sinai, Los Angeles, for their care and support. The couple, who married in 2018, confirmed in April that they had named their first child Malti Marie Chopra Jonas. 'We are overjoyed to confirm that we have welcomed a baby via surrogate,' the couple said in January. 'We respectfully ask for privacy during this special time as we focus on our family. Thank you so much.'",
    "a58aef00eae465f14ed594e95c1437cab6f6120ce0009d7a535ef7f5": "When Jodie Whittaker announced she was quitting Doctor Who in July last year, speculation about who would take over from her quickly followed. Everyone from It's A Sin star Olly Alexander to Hugh Grant were linked to the role, but it's fair to say that Sex Education's Ncuti Gatwa, who plays the beloved Eric, wasn't on many people's Doctor Who bingo cards (our bad, Ncuti).  Now, following the announcement that the 29-year-old will be the 14th Time Lord, we're all feeling (a) like idiots for overlooking him and (b) very excited indeed that this young, Black, queer star will be taking up residence in the Tardis. As showrunner Russell T Davis put it so perfectly: 'The future is here'. And it's not just your average Doctor Who fans who agree... Ncuti is equally pumped about his new role too, saying: 'Unlike the Doctor, I may only have one heart but I am giving it all to this show. 'There aren't quite the words to describe how I'm feeling. A mix of deeply honoured, beyond excited and of course a little bit scared.  'This role and show means so much to so many around the world, including myself, and each one of my incredibly talented predecessors has handled that unique responsibility and privilege with the utmost care. 'I will endeavour my upmost to do the same. Russell T Davies is almost as iconic as the Doctor himself and being able to work with him is a dream come true. His writing is dynamic, exciting, incredibly intelligent and fizzing with danger. 'An actor's metaphorical playground. The entire team have been so welcoming and truly give their hearts to the show. 'And so as much as it's daunting, I'm aware I'm joining a really supportive family.' Queer As Folk and It's A Sin writer Russell T Davies, who is returning as the programme's showrunner after leaving Doctor Who in 2009, promised fans Ncuti would be 'spectacular' in the role. 'Sometimes talent walks through the door and it's so bright and bold and brilliant, I just stand back in awe and thank my lucky stars. 'Ncuti dazzled us, seized hold of the Doctor and owned those Tardis keys in seconds. 'It's an honour to work with him, and a hoot, I can't wait to get started.' Neither can we.",

    "e0ccf582da4a86bcfcf15a81be37ab607f650be180dcccef21f44aa8": "Labour's Wes Streeting completely dismissed any notion that the police might find Keir Starmer did break social distancing rules last year on Monday. The shadow health secretary was passionately defending the leader of his party after a weekend of new headlines about so-called 'beergate', an event where Starmer has been accused of breaching social distancing rules. Although Durham Police previously said they believed no offence was committed, the case has now been reopened following repeated calls from the Conservative Party. Asked what Starmer would do if he were found to have broken lockdown rules and fined on BBC Breakfast, Streeting replied: 'I just don't think that's going to happen, I'm not going to entertain that prospect.' Streeting also mocked the memo published by the Daily Mail over the weekend, which suggested that the meal Starmer was caught eating indoors (with a beer) was planned in advance. This comes after the Labour leader said that the gathering was spontaneous. The Labour MP replied: 'One of the remarkable things about that story in the Mail, was that it was entirely unsurprising and non-revelatory for anyone who has been involved in an election campaign. 'When you go on visits around the country, as Lisa Nandy said yesterday morning, senior politicians like Keir Starmer don't just rock up in a place like Durham and wander around aimlessly.' He said it was 'reasonable' that Starmer's dinner in Durham would have been arranged, so the memo does not 'contradict anything' that the Labour leader has previously said about beergate. Streeting claimed: 'I don't understand the controversy and certainly don't understand the comparison between that and the regular repeated rule-breaking in Downing Street and the lies of the prime minister.' He repeated that the big difference is that Johnson has been fined for attending a party in Downing Street in June 2020. 'And in this case, let's not forget, that police have looked at this before,' Streeting continued. 'OK, they're looking at it again now, there's been lots of calls particularly from the Conservative Party for them to do so.' He claimed that he expected the same outcome as the first time the police looked at the incident, adding: 'I saw nothing in that memo in the Daily Mail which I hadn't heard before.' When pressed as to why the Labour leader had cancelled his media event today, prompting speculation he was avoiding difficult questions, Streeting said he had 'no idea' why. But, he said Starmer had been answering journalists' questions wherever he's been across the country, so it's 'simply not true' that he's been ducking scrutiny from the press. Streeting echoed this message when he appeared on Sky News later on. He promised that the police's ongoing investigation into the prime minister and new probe into the Labour leader is very different, as Starmer will not be found guilty. Streeting said: 'What it will show is the stark contrast between Boris Johnson who was fined, Boris Johnson who lied about there being any events under his roof.' He also claimed it was 'perfectly legitimate campaigning activity', compared to the rule-breaking in Tories. He went on to describe the Daily Mail's memo revelation as: 'Breaking news: Keir Starmer has dinner.' 'I don't think people out there around the country think Keir Starmer is the kind of bloke who goes out there breaking the rules and getting smashed on a campaign. 'This is all stretching credibility!' When Sky's Kay Burley pointed out that Labour had not initially admitted deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner was also at the gathering, Streeting said it was a 'genuine cock-up' from the party to say she wasn't there, but that there was clearly 'nothing to gain' by lying about it intentionally. He added that he was 'frustrated, because all this is about is trying to drag an innocent man into the mud'. But, as Burley pointed out.: 'it's never the cock-up, it's the cover-up.' She noted that in January, Starmer said Johnson 'needs to do the decent thing and resign', when the prime minister was just under investigation - as the Labour leader himself is now. But, Streeting said Johnson had already been found to be lying to parliament at that point. 'How the Conservatives have the barefaced cheek to come out, gloating and demanding resignations and throwing round accusations of hypocrisy, I don't know. They should get their house in order.'",

    "a2fad71f6c631acad3a17b06911196258d9e607fa518117201b1d098": "Soaring numbers of people in Britain are going without food due to the cost of living crisis, according to new research. A survey by the Food Foundation found that some 7.3m adults live in households that skipped meals in April either because they could not afford food or because they could not access it. That compares to 4.7m adults in January - an increase of 57 per cent in just three months. The survey also found that 2.4m adults have not eaten for a whole day because they could not afford or get access to food. The Food Foundation said rising energy costs, allied to increased prices in the shops, were leading to greater food insecurity. Anna Taylor, the organisation's executive director, said 'The extremely rapid rise in food insecurity since January points to a catastrophic situation for families. 'Food insecurity puts families under extreme mental stress and forces people to survive on the cheapest calories which lead to health problems. 'The situation is rapidly turning from an economic crisis to a health crisis. Foodbanks cannot possibly be expected to solve this.  'The government needs to realise the boat is sinking for many families and it needs to be fixed. Bailing out with emergency food parcels is not going towork.' Professor Sir Michael Marmot of University College London said 'Food is basic, but so is security. Both are vital to good health. 'If one household in seven is food insecure, society is failing in a fundamental way. These figures on food insecurity are all the more chilling because the problem is soluble, but far from being solved it is getting worse.' Shadow work and pensions secretary Jon Ashworth said: 'These are devastating findings that reveal the acute levels of hunger impacting families and children nationwide caused by the Conservative cost of living crisis.  'The Tory cuts to Universal Credit, rocketing energy bills, their punishing tax rise and real terms pensions cut is pushing more and more working people, families and pensioners to food bank queues.  'With warnings of inflation heading to 10 per cent it's clear Boris Johnson has lost control of the cost of living crisis causing devastating hardship across the country.' Last week, environment secretary George Eustice sparked anger when he suggested families buy supermarket own brand food to help make ends meet. A government spokesperson said: 'We recognise the pressures on the cost of living and we are doing what we can to help, including spending PS22bn across the next financial year to support people with energy bills and cut fuel duty. 'For the hardest hit, we're putting an average of PS1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families on universal credit, have also boosted the minimum wage by more than PS1,000 a year for full-time workers and our household support fund is there to help with the cost of everyday essentials.'",
    "4b50282e24392f0380a1ce9bbedce03bd90cd8e35122e40208012e31": "Like many parents, Angela Scanlon enjoys sharing baths with her two young children. But the family takes things one step further, ditching their clothes and dancing around the bedroom for regular 'nudie discos'.  'I love being naked!' the TV presenter and podcast host says with a laugh from the other side of our video call. 'And actually, I think it's really, really important. Florence Welch is on full tilt, Dog Days Are Over, and away we go!' Scanlon isn't a naturist, although she did present a documentary about the lifestyle once, and insists it's 'the least sexy thing you've ever seen'. But her liberal attitude to nudity stems from a desire to instil body confidence in her two daughters, Ruby, four, and Marnie, three months. 'It's those little things that I think are joyful in the moment, but also will hopefully allow for Ruby - and Marnie when she gets to that point - to realise her body is something that can be enjoyed. It is not there for consumption, it's not there to be looked at. It's actually hers to use and to feel,' she says.  The 38-year-old is particularly passionate about this, because from the age of 17 she struggled with an eating disorder that continued to impact her until her early thirties.  She's speaking publicly about her experience of anorexia and bulimia for the first time, having decided to write about it in her upcoming book, Joyrider.  In the book, she recalls being 'taught' how to make herself sick when she overheard another girl talking about it in the toilets during her final year of school. The idea appealed, she thinks, because her body had suddenly changed from a girl's to a woman's and she didn't know how to process it.  'I had an ankle injury and I stopped dancing and suddenly, I grew breasts and started to feel like my body was not my own anymore,' she tells HuffPost UK.  'The idea of womanhood felt quite terrifying. I think it is so difficult for so many young people - young women, especially - that sense of being out of control, of being thrust into this period in your life that you're not really prepared for, that you didn't really ask for. 'I don't think we're ever really given the tools or the skills or the language to understand how complex that is, and so we feel very alone.'  For the next 15 years, Scanlon continued to have flare ups of disordered eating, which usually coincided with times of feeling out of control.  But as her career took off - first presenting T In The Park and the Baftas red carpet, and later co-presenting the Robot Wars reboot in 2016 - she replaced her addiction to controlling food with an addiction to work. 'I just literally swapped one for the other,' she says, admitting that it wasn't necessarily a healthier replacement. Nor did it make her the nicest person; she once sacked an assistant because she said she wouldn't work on Sundays. It wasn't until she paused for maternity leave in 2018 that Scanlon realised her relationship with work was unsustainable. A whole heap of therapy and self-reflection helped her process where her need for control stemmed from. And she now recognises that self-identifying as an 'over-achiever' has its problems.  'It doesn't happen overnight, like I kind of imagined it might,' she says of recovery. 'It requires a lot more work, which nobody really wants to hear - myself included.' Thankfully, the physical changes of her pregnancy didn't cause a relapse in her eating disorder, but Scanlon was 'acutely aware' of the possibility. 'I focused on the nutrition side of things rather than anything else and knowing that my responsibility first and foremost was to nourish a baby,' she says. 'I was very, very, very careful not to allow myself to slip back into that.' Despite the movement to destigmitise mental illness in recent years - with a number of celebrities sharing personal stories - Scanlon felt the need to hide this part of her life until now. 'You know, I think I've wanted to talk about it for a long time. But then I was so afraid that that would be converting - I'd be defined as that [person] from a career point of view,' she says. As a '90s girl', she distinctly remembers the reaction when Geri Horner (nee Halliwell) first spoke about her experience of bulimia. 'She wrote about it in her autobiography - about going through a bin in George Michael's house to get some cake - and it was kind of ridiculed,' Scanlon says.  But today, she feels ready to speak out, in a bid to free herself from the secrecy of her past and, hopefully, to help others. 'It was though a part of myself was constantly hidden,' she says. 'And I think that kind of chips away at you, actually, without even really being aware of that.' Despite the seriousness of this topic, Scanlon is jovial during our call. Marnie is asleep, so she's taken the opportunity to go out for a walk in the sunshine, turning her phone's camera to show off a tree in full blossom. 'Look at that!' she exclaims. 'Gorgeous!' Joyrider is part memoir, part self-help guide, where Scanlon details her journey towards this happier place. She's quick to admit she's no expert, but instead describes herself as a 'human guinea pig', who's tried every self-help hack out there and is willing to lay bare her findings. It's not expensive retreats, lotions or potions that transformed her life, but the simple concept of practising gratitude. She describes the active choice of taking a more grateful path as 'joyriding'. For example, you can sit in a traffic jam and stress about being late for work. Or, you can pause to consider that your boss will probably get over it, and this is 15 minutes of stillness to listen to your favourite radio show.  When you take this path, you're 'joyriding'.   Of course, having the emotional capacity to 'look on the bright side' takes a huge amount of privilege; it's simply not possible when you're facing an acute threat, such as the cost of living crisis or any recent or ongoing trauma.  But there's enough self-awareness, humour and honesty in the pages of her book to avoid toxic positivity. For Scanlon, entering a new, lighter phase in her life has meant processing the darker times in her past, with the acknowledgement that life will also be a balance of both.  'That idea of finding joy, it seemed so out of reach, because I had kind of numbed and tapped out of all of the emotions [of life], because everything felt too much to bear. And I think that's what an eating disorder - or any sort of addiction - allows you to do. It's a kind of escape for those big feelings,' she says.   'But you know, my experience has been that in order to really feel the good stuff, or what we call the good stuff, you have to have dug around and allowed yourself to feel those kind of scary, awful feelings. You don't really get to just experience one without the other. 'There's something very hopeful about that - to my mind, anyway - that when you're rooting around and you're in that area where everything feels a bit hopeless and painful, actually, you can take a bit of comfort in the notion that that's part of the gig, and that the good shit comes afterwards.'

    "dbc772766f3ed2a179db9d78df95360fe56243e64b739abdee68e651": "You're reading Life-Work Balance, a series aiming to redirect our total devotion to work into prioritising our personal lives. Want to go for a massage on Wednesday? Or how about a karaoke sesh with pals on Tuesday?  Your initial thought might 'no, not on a work/school night', but that way of thinking might not be optimal if you want to have a better grip on your work-life balance. Most of us schedule fun things to do on a weekend, reserving social activities, life-admin, relaxation, recovery and everything else for a mere two days. And before you know it, it's Monday and you have another work week to get through.  We've been conditioned to count down the days to the weekend, then barely blink before it's over. But maybe we're going about it all wrong. Why do our personal lives take up a secondary role in our schedule? The obvious answer is that of course, work drains us out, with many of us working more hours than before, unable to switch off, or simply too tired to do anything else. But adding a bit of fun in this way can be exciting, necessary even, to break the monotony of the week and allow you to assert some control over your life. It could also make you feel better about work, thanks to the emotional respite you'll gain.  We're not talking about hobbies either - though these are important, incremental activities that cultivate progress out of the things we enjoy, be it exercise, a skill, or even something that helps us make extra money - we mean random events that brings pure joy without expectation of getting better.  This is exactly what Nessa, 26, who works in professional services in London, does. She's started a habit where each week, she plans one weekday post-work activity which can include food, going to the cinema, a concert, theatre etc. She tells HuffPost: 'I started doing this because working from home means it's quite tough to have a separation between home life and working life. Having something to look forward to really helps me to break up the week and stay motivated. 'For instance if I'm dreading a busy week on a Sunday, it's nice to know I'll be meeting friends for an exercise class on a Tuesday or watching a film on a Thursday!' But let's not ignore that many of these pastimes come with a price tag and not all of us may be in a position to spend, especially given the squeeze on our wallets right now. However, not all activities require money. You could organise a random games night with your friends, or a pot-luck dinner. How about a scavenger hunt? Or an amateur painting class in the living room, a movie marathon, a sleepover (perfect if you're both/all working from home), a sports day, a waterfight.  Don't have friends who are available? Try incorporating some solo adventures, or maybe even make some new pals in new settings - the point is shifting our focus away from work and taking back some time and power for ourselves.  Nessa adds: 'I think it's also helped me be more confident and explore activities by myself which I've really enjoyed.' The point is adding playfulness into our lives. When we're children, our lives are centred on playing but as we get older, we abandon such frivolities.  But, there's merit in bringing these back, says Catherine Price, the author of The Power of Fun, who also teaches people a course on how to have fun. '''True fun is the confluence of playfulness, connection and flow,' she tells HuffPost. 'They provide enjoyment, with knowledge and skills that might help you discover more opportunities for fun.' So how can you go about changing up your week? After all, you can't just plan to go to the theatre or do a social activity with friends every week - it's just not sustainable.  Price says while it's essential to incorporate opportunities for fun into our lives on a regular basis, we need to think holistically.  'I try to break down my fun into 'microdoses' and 'booster shots.' Microdoses are small things that you can put on your schedule on a regular basis that don't take too much work to organise and that might lead to fun - say, a regular lunch date with a friend, or a regular class (for example, I go to my guitar class every Wednesday). 'Then, a 'booster shot' is something that takes more work and planning, but has a bigger bang for your buck - like, say, a vacation or a weekend away with friends. Everyone's blend of microdoses and booster shots will be different; the point is simply to always have something to look forward to. 'The more you do so, the more likely it will be for you to experience playfulness, connection and flow (which are enjoyable and good for us even on their own) -- and, therefore, to have more experiences of true fun.' So, what are you doing this week?  Life-Work Balance questions the status quo of work culture, its mental and physical impacts, and radically reimagines how we can change it to work for us. ",
    "8756fbec8f92b6e2cd64c821eb0683a06a2cfa77025e1297f7f3e764": "This month marks 25 years since Katrina And The Waves stormed to Eurovision glory with the anthemic Love Shine A Light. Of course, that also means it's now been a quarter of a century since a UK entrant triumphed in the contest, a fact which is not lost on Katrina Leskanich. 'Twenty-five years, are you kidding me right now?' she tells HuffPost UK, shortly before the anniversary. 'It's kind of unbelievable on several fronts. In a country that has such a rich heritage of music and talent, it's incredible that it's been that long since the UK has won.' Katrina puts this lack of success in recent years down to 'the wrong choice and the wrong approach', but says things are 'looking better' in 2022 thanks to the UK's much-hyped entrant Sam Ryder. 'I think he's strong, he's good-looking, he can sing, he can deliver, he wrote the song, he has credibility - and 12 million followers on social media,' she says. 'It's the whole package. So, fingers crossed.' However, despite being firmly Team GB when it comes to Eurovision over the last 25 years, the American-born singer admits that some years have made it easier to support than others. 'As you can imagine, it's been challenging for me over the years, when I've been asked 'what do you think of this year's UK entry?', and I know in my heart that it's a fail,' she confesses. 'I don't want to criticise anybody or throw anybody under the bus. Everybody wants to get behind the UK entry, but damn that's hard when you know it's not working, and you know it's not going to work. 'And nobody wants to be impolite or dash the hopes of somebody who's got a big task at hand. Obviously, I want to try and instil confidence in people. But like I said, some years have been more challenging than others. Here's what else Katrina had to say when we took a stroll down Eurovision memory lane with her in the lead-up to this year's contest... Were you always a fan of Eurovision, and how has your opinion of it changed over time? I'd never seen Eurovision before we did it, and when we were asked if we had a song we could put forward for Eurovision, I wasn't clear what they were talking about. The two English boys in the group said, 'we do have a song called Love Shine A Light' - but it was in the bottom drawer, because we all thought it was too Eurovision-y for us to put out on a record. When we gave it to Jonathan King [executive producer of the selection show The Great British Song Contest], he went screaming to the hills with it and said, 'this is an out-and-out winner, we're putting it forward'. And my opinion of Eurovision has changed as Eurovision has changed. Back in the dark ages, when I did it and there were 24 contestants, it was very different. Now, it's grown and become more of a spectacle, more of a production, more bells and whistles - and hey, why not? What's your first memory of watching Eurovision at home? After we got through the Great British Song Contest and were declared the group that was going to represent the UK, I was sent 12 video tapes - twelve video tapes - of past Eurovisions. So I had a marathon weekend, where I watched every Eurovision since the time it began up until 1996.  And that's when I was very enlightened. And I did think, 'what in the hell is this?'. With all the clowns and the milkmaids and the babushkas and the grannies, it's like one poodle short of a circus. Come on! It was extraordinary. But I also thought, 'wow, Love Shine A Light is made for this event', because there is so much drama in that song, and that's what you need. Do you have a favourite memory of being part of Eurovision? It has to be that iconic moment from lockdown, when they used Love Shine A Light and everybody sang a line from it. That was almost a bigger moment than the win, because that was very, very emotional. There was not a dry eye in the house, I mean the poodle was crying. It was very, very sentimental, and very, very moving. So that would be the moment, aside from the win, We were constantly told by everybody, 'you can't win it', even when the votes were coming in! Even when we had so many points coming in that nobody could catch us! I f you watch the night back, and you listen to Terry Wogan's commentary, you'll see everybody couldn't believe [we won]! I remember looking up at the booth where Terry Wogan was, and he was holding a glass of champagne in one hand and a glass of Guinness in the other, and a glass of Irish whisky balanced on top of his head. It was that kind of night. It was insane! Who are you rooting for at Eurovision this year? Are you kidding? Of course, I will always be rooting for the UK. And some people say, 'well how could you want that, you'll lose your crown?'. But you never lose your crown. [Someone else winning] doesn't mean you're no longer a winner, it just means, 'great news, there's another one'. Obviously, the second country I'd be rooting would be Ukraine. I am half-Ukrainian, and I can't think of a better song or a better moment to show our support. It's not like the song is terrible and we're all going to vote for a terrible song - the song is very good, and we're all going to vote for it because we feel so heartbroken over this event that's happening. What are your three all-time favourite Eurovision songs? One that I had to include was Eres Tu by Mocedades. It's very, very moving, I've got goosebumps talking about it. Sweet, moving and anthemic, with a beautiful, beautiful melody. L'Oiseau Et L'Enfant by Marie Myriam. I had to sing it in French class in high school, but I had no idea what it was, or where it came from. And I didn't know it was Eurovision because I didn't know what Eurovision was in 1977 when I was singing it. And, of course, Loreen's Euphoria. That's actually my favourite of all time. Come on. Come on! When that song came out, it was a Love Shine A Light moment where as soon as you heard it, you knew nothing could touch it. It was 100% it, the whole package. Why is Eurovision still so important? It's one of those events that brings everybody together. It unites people, for good or bad. And it's also enormous fun!  I think the more outrageous and the more ridiculous the acts can be, the better. Because for me, it's pure entertainment. I don't like to see song after song that's a dreary ballad.  This interview has been edited for clarity and length. We'll be publishing an interview with a different Eurovision legend every day leading up to this year's live final on Saturday 14 May. Come back tomorrow when we'll be speaking to another former champion, Alexander Rybak. Katrina's new single Holiday is out now. Take a listen below:",
    "87152e05f4446da06dd9e2811460738c12faa6e26a2eec7ae70dceac": "The increase in the cost of living has affected everyone, especially parents. As the price of gas, electricity and food continue to soar, parents are left wondering how they can save money. And a huge expense that most parents pay for is childcare. The average cost for a part-time nursery place is PS7,000, according to the NCT, and some parents pay even higher fees if they require childcare for under twos, or full-time childcare. In fact, parents are now paying 2.5% more for childcare for children under two than they were a year ago, according one study. And a recent survey by Pregnant then Screwed and Mumsnet found two-thirds of respondents are paying as much or more for childcare than for rent or mortgage payments.  It's not always possible to save money on childcare, when really, parents need nationwide government intervention to help. However, we'll also take any tips we can get on lessoning the burden. Below, the consumer watchdog Which? has rounded up six potential ways to cut your childcare costs, including how to apply for any benefits or schemes you may have missed that you're eligible for.  1. Working parents can claim tax-free childcare: Tax-free childcare is a government scheme that pays working parents a top-up based on their childcare costs. Parents are able to claim PS500 every three months for each child looked after by an approved childcare provider, sent via an online account. Parents that meet the eligibility criteria can apply through HMRC. 2. Check if you're eligible for tax credits or universal credit Both Working Tax Credit and Universal Credit offer extra support for families, where the government gives the recipient extra money towards paying for childcare.  To qualify for Working Tax Credit, the person claiming, and their partner, must both work at least 16 hours a week. One person can be out of work if they are entitled to carer's allowance, in prison, in hospital, or incapacitated. It is possible to save up to 70% of childcare costs, up to a maximum of PS175 per week for one child, or PS300 for two or more children. Likewise, people claiming Universal Credit can get 85% of their childcare costs covered, to a maximum of PS646 a month for one child, or PS1,108 for two or more children. 3. Take advantage of free childcare hours In England, there are schemes available for parents with very young children The 'free childcare for two-year-olds' scheme is for those who receive certain benefits. In addition, everyone is eligible for 15 hours of free childcare per week for children aged three or four. This is for 38 weeks a year, but parents can opt to take fewer hours to spread this over more weeks. Those on lower incomes might be able to claim 30 hours of free childcare a week, as long as they and their partners are earning at least the national minimum wage or living wage.  In Scotland, all three and four-year-olds are entitled to around 30 hours of free childcare a year. There is also a scheme for two-year-olds for those on certain benefits and low incomes. In Wales, all three and four-year-olds can get 30 hours of free childcare a week. The 30 hours is made up of a minimum of 10 hours of early education a week and a maximum of 20 hours a week of childcare.  In Northern Ireland, three and four-year-olds get 12 and a half hours of free childcare per week during term time through a funded preschool place. 4. Find cheap and free holiday activities The Family and Childcare Trust lists organisations in local areas and provides information about childcare and family services. There are often youth groups and community centres which offer some form of help during the holidays. 5. Check out local charities Organisations like the YMCA, local church groups or local authority play schemes could be good places to check for free after-school clubs and classes. These are intended for parents who are unable to pick their children up after school, which can save a lot of money compared to a nanny or childminder. However, services can be limited to only serving certain schools in the local area. 6. Try 'parent sharing' with a friend For parents with friends who have similar schedules and childcare needs, a cheaper or free childcare option is to consider looking after each other's children. While this erases the advantage of professional childcare, it allows children to socialise.",
    "0601affbddbfa47a52c89cf20c0f686dadd71de604a1f7a83724aadb": "Despite a devastating set of local election results, many Tories were cock-a-hoop on Friday night. With exquisite timing, Durham Constabulary had announced that they would, after all, be re-opening their investigation into whether Keir Starmer broke lockdown rules by having curry and a beer with colleagues in April, 2021. After weeks of miserable headlines over lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street, during which time the Labour leader had repeatedly called on Boris Johnson to resign, it was a chance for the Conservatives to finally get back on the front foot. Many of them grabbed that opportunity with both hands, gleefully pointing out that it would be the height of hypocrisy were Starmer not to abide by the standards he had set others and pledge to quit if handed a fixed penalty notice. They included senior cabinet figures like Nadine Dorries as well as foreign office minister James Cleverly. But not for the first time, they had not really thought through the consequences of what they were saying. Just imagine for a moment what would happen were Starmer to be fined and then announce his resignation. It would undoubtedly be hugely disruptive for Labour, who would again be thrown into a divisive leadership contest at a time when they should be focusing all their energies on holding the prime minister and his government to account. But it would also throw the spotlight back onto the PM's repeated refusal to resign, despite the fact that he has been fined for attending a birthday party for himself in the Cabinet Office and there may well be further sanctions to come. People would rightly ask why it was right for the leader of the opposition to go, but not Johnson as well. As Patrick Maguire of The Times has revealed, more sensible Tories are aware of the dangers and discussing whether the party should tone down its attacks on Starmer. As David Simmonds MP told other members of the Tories' 2019 intake in a WhatsApp group: 'The only 'good' outcome I can see is if Starmer is fined and doesn't resign. Any other outcome just makes us look worse by comparison.' This also explains why Jacob Rees-Mogg also suggested to Andrew Neil that Starmer need not resign even if he is fined. He said: 'I think he should pay a fine and then talk about the issues of great importance to the nation.' Of course, Durham police may well stick to their original conclusion that no rules were broken by the Labour leader, who will then be able to turn his fire on the PM once again. But if they overturn their decision and decide he did contravene the law as it stood at the time, it will be devastating for him - but could well end up being fatal for Boris Johnson as well.",

    "2115942ff035e57ac4095ea565337931400c80c079c7fedaaf9471cc": "Keir Starmer should not have to resign if he is fined for breaking lockdown rules, Jacob Rees-Mogg has suggested. The Brexit opportunities minister said the beergate affair was 'in the same category of seriousness' as the partygate scandal, which he has previusly described as 'fluff'. Starmer's leadership of the Labour Party has been thrown into crisis after Durham Constabulary confirmed they were re-investigating whether he broke covid regulations in April, 2021, by having curry and beer with colleagues. He has previously called on Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, who were both handed fixed penalty notices by the Metropolitan Police for attending a birthday party in 10 Downing Street during lockdown, to resign. Some Tories have said Starmer should show consistency and quit if he, too, ended up being fined. Interviewed on Channel 4's The Andrew Neil Show, Rees-Mogg said: 'The difficulty for Sir Keir is he said - before any result of any investigation - that the Prime Minister should resign. 'Which sets a rather high standard and I think the issue for him is one of judgment.' Asked if Sir Keir should quit if he was found to have broken the law, Mr Rees-Mogg said: 'I think he should pay a fine and then talk about the issues of great importance to the nation.'  Speaking on Friday, Starmer said: 'As I've explained a number of times, we were working in the office, we stopped for something to eat. No party, no breach of the rules.   'The police obviously have got their job to do. We should let them get on with it but I'm confident no rules were broken.' The row has reignited bitter divisions in the Labour Party, amid claims a disgruntled former aide had directly contradicted Starmer's version of events in the Sunday Times. Shadow communities secretary Lisa Nandy has insisted Starmer did not break lockdown rules. She said: 'This is a guy who's self isolated six times during the pandemic, I don't know a single other person who did that. He is Mr Rules, he does not not break the rules, he was the director of public prosecutions, not somebody who goes around tearing up rules when it suits him, in stark contrast to the prime minister.'

    "cf02c3fadccf07db4a6e0dfb001a63f7dd44014ffccc00c21446d8eb": "Ncuti Gatwa will take over from Jodie Whittaker as the Time Lord in Doctor Who, the BBC has announced. The 29-year-old will become the 14th Doctor on the popular BBC show, after Jodie announced last July she would be leaving the role. Scottish actor Ncuti, who was born in Rwanda, has starred as Eric Effiong in Netflix's hugely popular Sex Education about socially awkward high school student Otis (Asa Butterfield) and his sex therapist mother Jean (Gillian Anderson). Speaking about his new role, Ncuti said: 'There aren't quite the words to describe how I'm feeling. A mix of deeply honoured, beyond excited and of course a little bit scared. This role and show means so much to so many around the world, including myself, and each one of my incredibly talented predecessors has handled that unique responsibility and privilege with the utmost care. 'I will endeavour my upmost to do the same. Russell T Davies is almost as iconic as the Doctor himself and being able to work with him is a dream come true. His writing is dynamic, exciting, incredibly intelligent and fizzing with danger. 'An actor's metaphorical playground. The entire team have been so welcoming and truly give their hearts to the show. 'And so as much as it's daunting, I'm aware I'm joining a really supportive family. Unlike the Doctor, I may only have one heart but I am giving it all to this show.' In 2020 Ncuti was named the winner of the actor category at the Scottish Bafta's for his role in Sex Education, and has been nominated at this year's Bafta TV awards, taking place on 8 May, in the best male performance in a comedy programme.   The actor previously told the Big Issue magazine, in 2020, about his move from Scotland to London when he was 21 and how he'd spent months before landing his role in Sex Education 'couch-surfing' adding: 'I didn't have a home. I was homeless. 'The only thing stopping me from being on the streets was the fact I had friends. But you can use up that goodwill. Or you feel scared to ask people for help. Your pride kicks in. 'So my life before Sex Education was so different. To go to my audition, I had to get my friend to transfer me 10 quid so I could top up my Oyster card.' Jodie took over the Tardis in 2017 as the first female Doctor. Queer As Folk and It's A Sin writer Russell T Davies is returning as the programme's showrunner after departing the show in 2009. The writer, who was responsible for Doctor Who's revival in 2005, will be back to celebrate the show's 60th anniversary in 2023, the BBC previously said. He said: 'The future is here and it's Ncuti! Sometimes talent walks through the door and it's so bright and bold and brilliant, I just stand back in awe and thank my lucky stars. 'Ncuti dazzled us, seized hold of the Doctor and owned those Tardis keys in seconds. 'It's an honour to work with him, and a hoot, I can't wait to get started. I'm sure you're dying to know more, but we're rationing ourselves for now, with the wonderful Jodie's epic finale yet to come. 'But I promise you, 2023 will be spectacular!' The announcement was teased by Russell and Ncuti on Instagram, with a post featuring two heart emojis, a plus symbol and a blue square. BBC chief content officer Charlotte Moore said: 'Ncuti has an incredible dynamism, he's a striking and fearless young actor whose talent and energy will set the world alight and take Doctor Who on extraordinary adventures under Russell T Davies' new era.'   Georgia Tennant, wife of former Doctor Who star David Tennant and daughter of Peter Davison, who also played the Doctor, reacted to the news that Gatwa will take over from Jodie Whittaker, tweeting: 'Hello dad'. The BBC said further details would be announced in due course.",

But, folks... it looks like we might actually have a shot of winning Eurovision. This year, singer-songwriter Sam Ryder is representing the UK with his song Space Man, which has already had heavy rotation on both Radio 1 and Radio 2. He's also been doing the rounds on various TV shows around Europe, and having now landed in Turin, he's impressed Eurovision fans with both his rehearsal footage and press interviews. Following the news that the UK will be performing in the second half of the live final next week (usually seen as a more coveted spot in the running order), Sam has now risen up the rankings in terms of the bookies' odds. According to Oddschecker - who compare betting odds from around 25 of the UK's bookies - Sam has overtaken the representatives for both Italy and Sweden, and is now second favourite to win Eurovision on behalf of the UK for the first time in 25 years. Ukraine is still the firm favourite, where they'll be represented by Kalush Orchestra with their song Stefania. Speaking to journalists this week in Italy, Sam spoke about how winning the contest is not his main aim, and how he hopes he can change people in the UK's attitudes to Eurovision:  The UK has had a somewhat complicated relationship with Eurovision in recent years, infamously finishing with nul points for the second time in history in 2021 following James Newman's performance of Embers. It's now been a quarter of a century since we won the contest, with Katrina And The Waves' anthem Love Shine A Light. This year's Eurovision Song Contest final will air live on Saturday 14 May on BBC One.",
    "0269deaf42b2843687ca09924ee8da14f28b2adf123fe1fba02e000b": "Keir Starmer is 'Mr Rules' and did not break lockdown by having a beer and curry at a campaign event, Lisa Nandy has said.  Durham Police have said they will re-investigate Conservative Party claims the Labour leader breached Covid regulations in April 2021. At the time of the Durham gathering there was a ban on indoor mixing between households, but there was an exemption for work. Labour has insisted that the curry was consumed between work events, meaning it was within the rules.  The Mail on Sunday published a memo which showed an hour and 20 minutes had been set aside for 'dinner' at Durham Miners Hall, after which the visit was due to end.  Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, told Sky News on Sunday that Starmer had 'a bunch of questions to answer' and accused him of 'rank double standards' and 'complete hypocrisy'. But Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, told the same broadcaster it was 'absurd' to compare the accusations against Starmer to Boris Johnson's 'serial partying'. She said rather than undermining Starmer's explanation, the Mail on Sunday report actually showed 'exactly' what happened. 'He went on a work visit, he stopped to eat at various times during the day as was factored into the work visit,' she said.  'This is a guy who's self isolated six times during the pandemic, I don't know a single other person who did that. 'He is Mr Rules, he does not not break the rules, he was the director of public prosecutions, not somebody who goes around tearing up rules when it suits him, in stark contrast to the prime minister.' She added it in no way was similar to Johnson 'who was under investigation by the police for 12 separate gatherings' which 'included karaoke parties, bring your own bottle parties, pub quizzes, suitcases full of wine being smuggled through the back door'. 'Keir Starmer went on a work visit and had a break to eat,' she said. 'It was not illegal to eat.' But separately, a source who was present told the Sunday Times: 'It has been claimed that Starmer worked during the curry and then after the curry. None of those two things happened. He did not go back to work to the best of my knowledge.' The row has also reignited internal Labour splits. Speaking to HuffPost UK, an ally of Starmer blamed the briefing on 'an embittered former employee who can't get over the fact Jeremy Corbyn isn't leader any more'.  Diane Abbott also said Starmer should 'consider his position' if he is fined. The former shadow home secretary, a close ally of Corbyn, told LBC: 'I think this is a lot of hype built up by the Tory press, but if he were to get a fixed penalty notice he would have to consider his position.' Starmer told reporters on Saturday: 'As I have explained a number of times, I was working in the office, we stopped for something to eat. There was no party, no breach of rules, I am confident of that.' He said he would not resign and would lead Labour into the next general election. ",

However, during their performance in Manchester on Saturday night, the trio were moved to tears for a very different reason. During the show, Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall were performing their hit Secret Love Song - which they've repeatedly said is considered by the band to be an anthem for their LGBTQ fans - when they spotted a proposal in the crowd. 'Congratulations! I'm gonna cry!' Perrie shouted from the stage. As she tried to carry on with the routine, Perrie admitted she was struggling to contain her emotions, telling fans: 'Oh, I can't. I'm a sucker for love. I'm gone! I'm gone!' 'Let's sing it to them,' Jade then suggested, but all three members of the group found themselves unable to continue with their lines, instead inviting the arena to sing to the newly-engaged pair in the crowd.  More than a decade after being put together on The X Factor, Little Mix announced last year that they were planning to take a break from the group when their Confetti tour comes to an end.  In an interview published earlier this week, though, they made it clear that they had no intention of making their hiatus a permanent one. 'Honestly, we haven't even parted ways yet and we're already talking about when we're coming back!' Perrie joked. 'We're like, 'is two years away enough? Two and a bit years?'.' Little Mix's final show on their Confetti tour will take place at the O2 Arena, London on 14 May, but will also be live-streamed so fans around the world can watch what promises to be an emotional farewell for the chart-topping band.",
    "9796ca6dda233cacf4577d5ad6f148e3f4490f2ccf52254553b9cb04": "Britain's Got Talent bosses have spoken out in support of the show's latest Golden Buzzer act, after viewers discovered he'd previously appeared in various other shows in the same franchise. During Saturday night's episode, BGT hosts Ant and Dec gave their Golden Buzzer to Japanese magician Keiichi Iwasaki, after they were impressed with his impressive illusion act. Keiichi won over all four members of the panel, as well as the presenting duo, who gave him a fast pass to the next stage of the competition. However, after the episode aired, some viewers on social media took issue with the fact that BGT marks Keiichi's fifth time appearing on a Got Talent series. Previously, he auditioned for Bulgaria, Spain and Germany's equivalent talent shows, and even made it to the semi-finals of Italia's Got Talent in 2016 with one of the tricks showcased in his BGT audition. Responding to this criticism, a spokesperson for BGT defended Keiichi, insisting he's deserving of his spot on the show. 'As with many other entertainers who are hoping for success in the industry, Keiichi, a street performer, had previously auditioned on television shows in the past,' they told HuffPost UK. 'There are no rules that state this should prevent him from applying. All acts audition on the same basis and normal programme rules apply.' Responding to some headlines accusing Keiichi's involvement of being evidence of a 'fix', they added: 'These claims unnecessarily encourage negative trolling against our contestants and 'fix' claims are completely untrue. 'We have always been very open about who can apply for BGT. We look forward to our viewers tuning in to show their support to Keiichi.' BGT bosses were previously forced to defend another of this year's Golden Buzzer acts, Loren Allred, whose voice was featured in the hit film The Greatest Showman.

    "31a75201d88f894e43fd96474fcf76af82dced8b1ea9b70bd73b7130": "Boris Johnson will lead the Conservatives into the next general election despite the party's drubbing at the local elections, Dominic Raab has said. Speaking on Sunday morning, the deputy prime minister said he did not think the prime minister would face a no confidence vote from Tory MPs. 'I am confident that he can and will win the next election,' he told Sky News.  'What people vote in a set of mid-term elections and what they vote when you chose a government at a general election are two wholly different things.' But he admitted he faced a 'tough fight' to keep his own Esher and Walton seat in Surrey. On Thursday the Conservatives lost almost 500 council seats across the country as Labour and the Lib Dems both made gains. Conservative MPs have so far largely stood by the prime minister, despite the fallout from the partygate scandal and the cost of living crisis. But several grassroots leaders have questioned whether Johnson should remain in office. John Mallinson, leader of Carlisle City Council, hit out after Labour took control of the new Cumberland authority which will replace it. 'I just don't feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth,' he said. Labour made headline grabbing gains in London, chalked up victories along the south coast of England and leap-frogged the Conservatives into second place in Scotland. The Conservatives are also under pressure for a revival of the Lib Dems, who snatched wins across the so-called Tory Blue Wall in the south, including winning control of Somerset council. Many Tory MPs will be worried that combined, Labour and the Lib Dems will be able to rob the Conservatives of a majority at the next election, due in 2024. Raab admitted the election results had been 'challenging' and a 'mixed bag' for the Conservatives. Asked if the prime minister would face a confidence vote, Raab told Times Radio: 'No, I don't think so.' Speaking to Sky News, he denied the Queen's Speech on Tuesday would be a 'reset' for the government but admitted there was a 'message we must heed'. But told Sky News: 'What we're going to be focusing on this week is what our plans are to drive up the economy, protect the cost of living.'",

The former Sherlock star opened the show with a monologue in which he told viewers: 'I am thrilled to be back hosting Saturday Night Live. It's been a really fun, great week. 'I've got to be honest though, because most of the sketch writers this week, they pitched me sketches everyday, and most were about Doctor Strange. 'I love the guy and I love playing the character. The film's doing really well--but I have been in other films.' Among the past films he referenced later in the monologue was the Netflix drama The Power Of The Dog, for which he bagged his second Oscar nomination.  'Come on, man. I was nominated for an Oscar for that,' he joked. 'I did okay. I mean, I didn't win. I was beat by Will Smith.' As the audience laughed, Benedict quickly added: 'No, not physically.' Benedict was, of course, referencing the moment Will Smith slapped Chris Rock during the Academy Awards this year, after the comic made a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett-Smith.  Will issued a public apology following the incident and later resigned from the Film Academy. After an investigation was conducted, Oscars organisers ruled that the former Fresh Prince star was banned from attending the awards show for the next 10 years. 'The action we are taking today in response to Will Smith's behaviour is a step toward a larger goal of protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy,' a statement said. 'We also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted.'",
    "d316e007f8caa371767b1efee6aa74f999e357beaa86f78539ef5867": "The UK will focus on efforts to reform the Northern Ireland Protocol in an effort to preserve stability, Dominic Raab said as the Government grappled with the implications of Sinn Fein's Stormont success. The victory in the Stormont contests was the first for a republican party and 'ushers in a new era' of politics, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O'Neill said. Her party is committed to a border poll on unification with Ireland, although that is not a likely prospect in the short term, with Raab pointing out that a majority of voters in Northern Ireland had not supported Sinn Fein's position. 'If you look at the results in Northern Ireland, 58% fully of people voted either for parties who support the Union or for parties who do not support constitutional change and that is the message from the people of Northern Ireland,' Raab told Sky News. 'We don't have an executive yet, I think the first priority, mindful of that 58% of people in Northern Ireland who are not calling for that kind of change, is to get the executive up and running.' O'Neill's hopes of becoming first minister in a powersharing executive hinge on the unionist DUP, the second largest party, joining an administration - something it has ruled out unless there are major changes to Northern Ireland's post-Brexit deal. Raab said the Government would take 'whatever measures are necessary' to resolve the issues around the protocol. But he refused to say whether action on the Northern Ireland Protocol would be included in Tuesday's Queen's Speech. He told Sky News: 'If anything, the outcome in Northern Ireland from those elections makes it clear it can't be put off.' He suggested it would be dealt with in the coming 'weeks and months', warning that stability in Northern Ireland was being 'imperilled' by the dispute over the protocol - which was agreed by Boris Johnson's Government as part of the Brexit divorce from the EU. The deadlock will increase tensions between Westminster and Brussels, with the UK insisting all options remain on the table - including the possibility of unilaterally scrapping elements of the deal. That could trigger a major breakdown in relations between the UK and European Union. The protocol effectively creates checks on goods flowing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland in order to allow an open border with Ireland, which is within the EU's single market and customs union. 'We will deal with the situation, we will take whatever measures are necessary to protect the economic as well as the constitutional integrity of Northern Ireland,' Raab said. He indicated that the protocol had been used as a 'political device' by Brussels. Ireland's Europe minister Thomas Byrne said 'a decisive majority' of the MLAs elected to Stormont want to make the protocol work and called on the UK to 'engage in a renewed way with the European Union' on the issue.",
    "9bf294c31dadb372275e889890e4d303cb024e5639a1e253bb9ac3b4": "Bitter divisions in the Labour Party have re-emerged after Keir Starmer faced fresh allegations about the beergate saga threatening his leadership. Durham Police have said they will re-investigate claims the party leader broke lockdown rules while having an Indian takeaway and drinks with colleagues. At the time of the gathering, in April 2021, social distancing rules remained in place, although there were exemptions for work meetings. Starmer - who called for Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak to resign after they were fined for breaking lockdown rules - has insisted no rules were broken as it was just a short break for food, after which he went back to work. But the Mail on Sunday published a memo which showed an hour and 20 minutes had been set aside for 'dinner' at Durham Miners Hall, after which the visit was due to end. Separately, the Sunday Times quoted an eyewitness present at the event who insisted no work was done after the meal. 'It has been claimed that Starmer worked during the curry and then after the curry,' the source said. 'None of those two things happened. He did not go back to work to the best of my knowledge.' But an ally of the Labour leader blamed the briefing on 'an embittered former employee who can't get over the fact Jeremy Corbyn isn't leader any more'. In a further sign of Labour splits, Diane Abbott said Starmer should 'consider his position' if he is fined. The former shadow home secretary, a close ally of Corbyn, told LBC: 'I think this is a lot of hype built up by the Tory press, but if he were to get a fixed penalty notice he would have to consider his position.' Speaking on Friday, Starmer said: 'As I've explained a number of times, we were working in the office, we stopped for something to eat. No party, no breach of the rules. 'The police obviously have got their job to do. We should let them get on with it but I'm confident no rules were broken.' But senior Tories have accused the Labour leader of lying and 'hypocrisy'. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told Times Radio: 'He has tweeted himself saying that if you're under investigation, a criminal investigation, then you should resign.'",

The sports legend has fronted the BBC's flagship football highlights show since 1999, but was recently at the centre of social media speculation another presenter could be about to take over. Following the news that James Corden is leaving his US talk show role in 2023, many began to wonder whether he could succeed Gary as host of MOTD from next year onwards. While most Brits know James as an actor and comedy writer, he has fronted The Late, Late Show in America for the past seven years, as well as hosting the Brit Awards, Tonys and Grammys. He also presented the popular sports panel show A League Of Their Own between 2010 and 2020 on Sky. However, Gary has shut down the rumours on his official Twitter page, insisting he's going nowhere for the time being. 'Getting a number of texts from friends asking if I'm quitting @BBCMOTD after reports on Twitter of my possible successor,' he wrote on Saturday night 'So it's only fair I give you the bad news now: I'm afraid I still have 3 years to run on my contract, so you're stuck with me for a while.' For the past four years, Gary has been named as the BBC's top-earning on-screen talent, despite having recently accepted a pay cut of around PS400,000. Other presenters near the top of the list included Radio 2's Zoe Ball and Steve Wright, as well as BBC News' Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce.",
    "a6982a5e8108a92e7fdba7276227015e6e8426246e3ec5ec743fa8a2": "I've always found it endearing the way men pay homage to the mothers and matriarchs in their lives. We love songs like Tupac's Dear Mama' and Bill Withers' 'Grandma's Hands.' We witness the robust relationship between Kanye West and his late mother, Donda, who was undoubtedly his biggest fan, in the documentary Jeen-Yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy. We heard the gut-wrenching cries of George Floyd calling out for his mother moments before his death in 2020.  Black motherhood has often been centered in the analysis of the Black family -- and for Black men, the maternal connection is vital, political and liberating. These affirmations are dedicated to women whose labor and love are far-reaching and priceless. The vocal appreciation is always welcomed, especially when the work of mothers has often been overlooked. 'My mother is a force of nature. If she wants to get something done, it's getting done. I think that's been pretty evident in the course of her journey,' said Sulaiman Rashid, a 20-year-old college student in Washington, DC, whose mother raised four kids. 'My siblings and I have different career paths, but we are all grounded in the desire to create change, and that stems from my mom's passion to help and to serve others and to aid in the betterment of the world.' I wanted to explore the relationships between sons and their mothers. In this series of portraits, I photographed families and asked the sons to share some perspectives of the role their mothers had in their lives. From guidance on love, career and education to artistic inspiration and global travel, we see an expansive view of the strong bonds between Black sons and their mothers.      Diane Redfern            Sons: Christopher and Charles Tarpley         My mother, commonly known as Lady D, is a resilient and confident mother. She has a jazzy personality and is a strong woman of faith. She raised my brother and I to become the gentlemen we are today. - Charles        My mother's favourite saying is 'I'm gonna tell you what God loves ... the truth.' This is what I admire about my mother the most, her love of God. She has such a strong will to never give up no matter how tough things may be raising twins. - Chris      Tamara Redfern           Sons: Yaseen Ellison and Mujahid Ellison      My mother has always been a source of light in my life. Across time and space - from my earliest memories in the US to years later and continents away - this has rung true. The continuum of joy and love surrounding my mother could not be summarised by a discrete moment. How would I describe my mother, who first showed me the magic and vibrancy of life? Who taught me firm confidence in my ability to grow, adapt, achieve and inspire? I realise I don't have to isolate any single experience to highlight who she is when everyone who encounters her is liberated by her grace and kindness, and when all spaces she walks through are automatically elevated by her presence. It is no wonder Allah says heaven lies at the feet of the mothers. I love you, Mom. - Yaseen    When I think of my mother, my thoughts often associate her with the moon. Her radiant, smiling face is akin to the light of the moon on a clear night sky. Her sound judgment and listening ear have served as a therapy to the many problems I've come to her with over the years. Her belief and willingness to lend a helping hand to me, unwavering, in times when I felt all was lost. Time after time, failure after failure, my mother has always been by my side. The best person to have around when sharing good news, as her pure, bona fide joy for you can be experienced by anyone who has interacted with her. The funny thing is my mother has taught me virtually everything I need to survive and thrive on my own, but hates it when I'm not around. There's no better feeling than being capable of being alone but still having someone who never wants you to be alone. She's my light and my guidance; my mother is my moon. I love you, Mom. - Mujahid       Aisha Hassan           Son: Bilal Hassan         Ummi is very special to me; she means the world to me. She is my friend, travel buddy and confidant. I love being around her. She raised me into the young man that I am today. She is generous, caring, loving and not afraid to speak her mind. She was literally my first teacher. I was homeschooled from kindergarten to sixth grade by her and my father, who has since passed away. Back then, we didn't have all of the home-schooling resources that exist today. Now, homeschooling is this big thing with programmes that you can do online. She created an amazing curriculum for us. She was extremely resourceful in making sure that we had an optimal learning experience. We did so much with very little. We had so much fun on our extended learning library trips. She is a genius. I could never repay her for how much she has poured into me. - Bilal                Jamilah Rashid  Son: Sulaiman Rashid         My mother is a force of nature. If she wants to get something done, it's getting done. I think that's been pretty evident in the course of her journey. My siblings and I have different career paths, but we are all grounded in the desire to create change, and that stems from my mom's passion to help and to serve others and to aid in the betterment of the world. I love her because she gave that to me. I can't describe all the ways and reasons why I love her. As I grow into a man, I hope that my need for her doesn't wane or fade. When I was younger, I needed her to read me bedtime stories, and what I need from her now is guidance in selecting a companion and partner. She did a really great job, and I'd be very blessed to find someone like her. I'm grateful to her every single day for who she is as a mother, wife and a person. - Sulaiman         Adama Delphine Fawundu         Sons: Amal Buford, Kofi Buford and Che Buford (not pictured)         My mom set the standard and laid the foundation. She's always been so driven and always accomplishes what she sets her mind to. There are so many roles that a mother can fulfil: a provider, a protector, a friend, an inspiration. She does it all. Some of my most fond memories are of us getting up really early and riding the subway to school. Even though it was the crowded subway, it felt like just us; it was so warm. We would have some of the best conversations. We would talk about anything and everything. We would read together; we would do math problems together. I love thinking about those times. It makes me nostalgic. You don't realise how important that is, and I don't ever want to take that for granted. It's never been a question as to whether my brothers and I were her priority. She would drop us off and then have to go work her own job. It's a job within a job. I'm older and I live on my own; I'm independent, but my mother is still my biggest inspiration. - Amal       My mother introduced me to so much. The knowledge and experiences that she imparted on me shattered the limitations that would otherwise be present in my life. It's the reason why my creativity flourishes. We've traveled together. She took me to Sierra Leone, New Orleans, Phoenix, so many places. When we travel, we have fun, but we also learn about the land, the monuments, the historical connections. Our travels showed me the beauty of different cultures and that there are many ways of living. I love my mother. She always supported me. - Kofi  Karen D. Taylor     Sons: Chenzira Taylor Lewis and Siyaka Taylor Lewis         I have always been enamoured by my mother's unadulterated focus and ability to create as an artist. It's always helped me to see her not only as a mum, but also as an artist and creative in her own right. And it's been inspiring to see her flourish throughout my life in her different creative identities. She always encouraged my autonomy and inquisitiveness and aided my creative spirit. Her determination demonstrated that my dreams and creative endeavours are attainable. -- Chenzira  I see my mother as a community pillar, a preservationist of Blackness and Black culture and Black excellence. She is a preserver of the relic, an educator, a nurturer, a policer of integrity. I love the uniqueness of who she is, her quirks, her silliness, her strength and intelligence. She is very New York to the core; she is an intellectual, a scholar with the grit of the jazz nightlife scene. Most definitely a music snob, jazz and blues head, creatively impulsive, loving, laid back and full of big laughs. At the core, she is serene. She is literally the perfect yin and yang of creativity and strong love. - Siyaka    ",
    "2280c5283cb3384927854781eebcde0b33a297e422fa9f6c53ee2bd3": "On January 22, 1973, the US Supreme Court affirmed in a 7-2 decision the legality of women's right to have an abortion under the 14th Amendment.  Today, about one in four pregnancy-capable people in the US have had an abortion, and the risk of complications from an in-clinic procedure is extremely low. But before it was guaranteed as a constitutional right, seeking an abortion was a harrowing, potentially life-threatening endeavour.   While some women saved up the cash and sometimes travelled hundreds of miles to find qualified medical providers willing to risk their livelihood by operating on patients, others settled for providers lacking the qualifications and skills to perform induced abortions. And even more desperate people attempted their own abortions.  The outcome of these back-alley procedures or at-home coat-hanger abortions was often devastating, leading to maternal death or lifelong injury. (Complications from unsafe abortions include infection, incomplete abortions, haemorrhaging, uterine perforation and damage to the genital tract or internal organs, according to the World Health Organisation.) Because these stories were so traumatic - and because the stigma surrounding abortion was even greater in those pre-Roe v. Wade years - many women remained silent about their experiences.  Now, as the US Supreme Court seems poised to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision, it's worth revisiting their stories to understand what abortion was like in the decades before it was legalised. HuffPost US recently spoke to eight people who shared experiences of relatives - great-grandmas, grandmas, mothers and aunts - who sought abortions in pre-Roe v. Wade America. Many were already mothers, struggling to conceptualise raising one more child in poverty or, in some cases, with an abusive spouse. In one story that differs from the rest, a reader shares how her great-grandma, the wife of a well-to-do dentist, was able to obtain a safe abortion in a doctor's office with little fuss; the story illustrates how white, middle-class and upper-class women have always had an easier time accessing safer abortion options. (As many have noted, women of colour will be disproportionately affected if Roe v. Wade is overturned.)  Below, read all eight stories, which have been edited lightly for clarity, style and length.  'My maternal grandparents married in 1934. By the time my mother was born, it was clear my grandpa was a monster. Violent and cruel, he beat my grandma with a metal lunchbox. When mom was just a few months old, he threw her against a wall. My grandmother fled. She discovered she was pregnant again. To induce an abortion, she drank a bottle of Lysol. You can Google 'Lysol abortion' and see ads from that time that suggested a woman could use Lysol to 'correct your mistake.' The ads are quite chilling, their meaning vague and without instructions. It took my grandma 29 hours to die in her parent's home; they were helpless to end the agony. Living in a logging village in winter, there was no hospital or way to travel to the city. My mother always felt responsible for her mother's so-called 'suicide,' as children do. Doing genealogy research, I uncovered the full story when my mother was in her late 60s, but her life was already written and the truth brought no comfort. I sometimes think I should never have done the research. There are four generations impacted by this one attempted abortion. We can never really know how lives would be different if she had lived. But I do know my mother's life was forged by that event, she was an orphan, hidden from her father, never knowing why she'd been abandoned.' - Chuck M., 62, from Washington state 'My mother was a 16-year-old in 1970 when she became pregnant as a result of sexual assault. She was living with my grandparents in Southern California, and abortion was not legal at that time. My grandparents were not in a position to get over the border into Mexico to have the procedure done, and they didn't have access to a safe place to have the procedure done, either. Rather than risking my mother in a back-alley abortion, my grandmother assisted my mother in inducing a miscarriage. My grandmother had my mother sit in steaming hot baths for hours. My mother ingested medications that were considered dangerous to a fetus. They did everything short of physically harming my mother, though my mother did tell me that she was so desperate to end the pregnancy that she considered throwing herself off a high platform or down the stairs. They managed to successfully induce a miscarriage, and my mother was taken to the local hospital to deal with the effects of the miscarriage and for a dilation and curettage. That worked, but her young body and mental health were not OK. Though my grandmother's and mother's intentions were to do something safer than a back-alley abortion, my mother was still at risk of potential harm from the various medications she took. And the foetus would also have been at risk for birth defects and other issues if the medications had not succeeded in a successful miscarriage. It was still dangerous. My mother told me once that Roe was the single most important law that passed in her lifetime. That she was relieved that other women and people with a uterus would not have to suffer the same circumstances she did. If she were alive today, she would be absolutely shattered.' - Sara from New York 'My aunt Judith was just 17 in 1964 when she became pregnant after being raped on a study date at a so-called friend's house. She was horrified to find out she was pregnant; she was on her way to college in the fall, and a baby wasn't in her plans yet. Her doctor suggested a girls home out of town where she could stay until the baby was born and then give it up for adoption; it was her only choice since abortion was illegal. Judith had tried all the old wives' tales, jumping backward a dozen times at dusk and even drinking a tea that made her deathly ill just to lose the pregnancy naturally, but nothing worked. A friend of hers, Arbie, who was two years older, had been in Judith's shoes and had taken care of her 'dilemma' herself. In that summer of 1964, Judith chose to use a metal coat hanger, thinking it would be over quickly and no one would ever know. Her end result was far more than she had ever anticipated, with excessive bleeding and infection that led to a partial hysterectomy and the inability to ever carry a child. She spent nearly a month in the hospital. Her mother found out and never looked at her the same, although she did keep [Judith's abortion attempt] from Judith's father, knowing he would have kicked her out and pulled her college tuition. The family was hush-hush about everything, given the era everything took place. Judith went on to graduate college top of her class to become the first female doctor of psychology in the family. From the outside looking in, her life was perfect: the house, her own office, nice car, all the material things one could ever hope to have, but she had developed a serious drinking problem and her life behind closed doors was, as she once said, 'exactly what you'd think hell on earth would be.' I was born in '72, her only niece at the time, and she doted over me constantly every chance she had. I never suspected anything was ever wrong, although I did always wonder why Auntie Judy had such sad eyes; it wasn't until puberty hit for me that she warned me of the dangers of having 'that time' and told me her story. She explained there were no real options in '64 but said that because of Roe v. Wade in '73, I would have more options than she had ever had. Her desire to be able to carry a child, to be the mother she had always dreamed of, haunted her every waking hour and her dreams, and she was never able to get away from it. In 1984, just a week shy of her 37th birthday, my Auntie Judy hung herself in her attic; the pain and anguish had finally won the battle. Her note was a short novel, telling her story. I was only 12 and was told I wasn't old enough to read it or understand it, but I didn't listen. I sneaked and read it, and now I can remember every word, and her pain, longing and anger still haunt me to this very day.' - AJ, 50, from Louisiana  'Like most kids raised by a single mother, I've always thought of my mom, Jan, as courageous, resilient and strong. Growing up, she commuted nearly two hours each day -- every day -- to work a low-paying job as a secretary so that my brother and I could have a better future. Despite all that she went through, my mom never gave up and ensured that my brother and I could get the best education and have more opportunities than she did. But it wasn't until I was in my 20s that I realised how truly incredible my mom is. One day, my mom shared that she was around my age when she had two abortions. This was 1968-69, when abortion was still illegal in the U.S. and my mom was 26 or 27 years old. My mom told me that she had her first abortion during this time while dating a much older man. The pregnancy was very unexpected, and because my mom was struggling to make ends meet and didn't have much support at all, she made the wrenching decision to abort the pregnancy. Because abortion was illegal in the States, the man found a doctor for her in Puerto Rico and agreed to pay for the procedure, so my mom went with my grandma to have it done. They traveled to San Juan and then traveled a bit outside of the city. My mom expected the procedure to be done with anaesthesia, but - horrifyingly - it wasn't. 'The abortion was done by a butcher and my mother heard me screaming,' my mom recalled. 'I didn't know that they weren't going to give me anaesthesia. It lasted for only 20 or 30 minutes, but it seemed like a lifetime. When we got back to the hotel in San Juan, I was in such pain. Then, when I was back in New York City in A&P Grocery a few days later, I noticed that I was bleeding -- haemorrhaging.' My grandma immediately called a gynaecologist and arranged to have my mom treated in the ER at Lenox Hill Hospital, where they didn't tell the doctors that the bleeding was caused by an abortion out of fear because the procedure was still illegal. My mom was lucky to survive.' - Jared Milrad, 38 'Today, the majority of women who seek a legal abortion are already mothers. Let me share a pre-Roe horror story about my Italian, Catholic grandmother Mary, whom I never had the blessing to know. Apparently, on her deathbed in 1943, Mary asked her sister-in-law Florence, who was childless, to take care of her only daughter, but the shameful secret had to be kept. My mom was forbidden to ask questions about her mother or her death. She learned the truth when she was in her 50s from me after years of research. I was in my 20s when I first began to put together the pieces of a story that just didn't make sense: a 34-year-old mother of three young children who is hemorrhaging but refuses to go to the hospital. Even the death certificate corroborates the secret. Cause of death: carcinoma of the cervix. But cervical cancer does not generally cause women to bleed to death. Then, one day in the mid-'70s, we were talking about the Roe decision, and Florence, the woman I knew as my grandmother, let it slip that she had to lend $250 (an enormity in 1943) to one of her brothers because someone needed an abortion. I was stunned; I finally connected the dots. In a typically large Italian Catholic family, Florence had many sisters but only two brothers. One of them, it turns out, was my biological grandfather. Grandma Mary already had three children she loved: two boys and the middle child, my mom Nancy. With an unemployed husband, a fourth child would plunge the family into poverty. So the decision was not made lightly, but something went horribly wrong. Mary was just 34 years old and was more afraid of the law (and the judgment of the Catholic church) than she was of dying and leaving her children motherless.' - Lori Bores from New York  'Great-Grandma Selma Rosenthal (born 1878) was a career woman. Graduating from college in 1901, she was homely and smart, two things that did not make her particularly attractive to suitors of the era. Knowing this, she focused on having a successful career. She was by all accounts very funny, with a wonderful voice and an active circle of friends. She had no expectation that marriage or family were in the cards for her, and she had made peace with that idea. That all changed when she met Sidney Rauh, a dentist from Cincinnati from a well-off family. It was the 1910s, and she was well into her 30s. Sidney was equally unattractive and clever, and a confirmed bachelor. He had no interest in marrying a girl for her looks but wanted to find someone he could love for her mind. When they met, it was love at first sight, and given their advanced ages, they decided to marry as soon as possible. Selma quickly became pregnant, only to miscarry the first Christmas they spent together as a married couple. Two daughters quickly followed in 1916 and 1919, but Selma was terribly sick with her second pregnancy and she barely survived childbirth. Her doctor told her, in no uncertain terms, that if she was to get pregnant again and attempt to see it to term, she would die. She promised she would be careful. A few years later, when she realised she was pregnant, she went to her doctor. The doctor advised her that she had to have an abortion. Sometime later, the doctor performed an abortion in his office, no fuss, no muss. But Selma was a well-off wife of a successful dentist with status in the community. It never occurred to her that what she was doing was illegal or in any way wrong. It was a decision between her, her doctor, and Sidney, and she did what was best for her family and health. Selma died in 1948 at the age of 62 of a heart attack, having spent time not just with her daughters, but also with her granddaughters, who were five and three at the time of her death. Great-Grandma was a suffragette and strived for women's rights. Women's rights and bodily autonomy were key issues in my family, but I suspect the story would not have been noteworthy had it not been for the fact that abortion became the issue it was later on. My mother and grandmother shared with me how hard things like birth control had been to get in their era, and my mother shared with me the fact that she got a (legal) abortion for family planning reasons. For us, it was just part of normal conversation.' - Kate, 50, from New York 'I was born in the 1960s and grew up in a very conservative Catholic family. Nonetheless, my traditional housewife mother was ardently pro-choice. She even took one of my friends to get an abortion in the 1980s because my friend couldn't tell her family she was pregnant.  Shortly after my paternal grandmother died, when I was a college freshman, my mother frankly told me during a conversation about choice, 'Your grandmother had a back-alley abortion and almost bled to death.'  My grandmother found herself - in the early 1940s before birth control or abortion were legal - pregnant and divorced from her second husband, who turned out to be horribly abusive. She decided to leave before he began abusing her three children from her first marriage. Like most women of her day, she had no college education or career to support herself and her children. And, like most women who get abortions, she could barely support the children she had. She ended up having to go live with her parents, who were Italian immigrants.  Faced with being twice divorced and pregnant, my grandmother sought an abortion. Because they were illegal, she had to trust a back-alley 'doctor,' who punctured her uterus in the process. She left the procedure, collapsed in the street from the blood loss, and had to be taken to the hospital. An emergency hysterectomy saved her life.  She was an amazing mother and grandmother, and although she died almost 40 years ago, I still become emotional when I think about what a loss I would have suffered had she died from that botched abortion. The rest of the family never knew. I am telling her story now in the same way that we disclosed our sexual trauma during the Me Too movement to educate others. Legal and safe abortion is critical to women's reproductive rights as American citizens, and we cannot allow them to expire.' - Stephanie Voltolin 'My great-grandmother died from a botched, illegal abortion in the mid-1930s in Chicago, leaving my grandmother (2 years old) and her sister (4 years old) without a mother. When my great-grandfather remarried, his new wife already had kids of her own and didn't want to take care of two more. My grandmother and her sister were thrown out of the house and bounced around to different aunts and uncles. For much of my grandmother's life, she was told that her mother died of a pregnancy complication due to an ectopic pregnancy. Later, when my grandma was a teenager, her aunt told her the truth: that her mother had died from a botched, illegal abortion. My grandmother shared her story with me in 2012 when I was 25. We were having an early lunch. I remember she asked me if I wanted a glass of wine, which was odd for her in the middle of the day. We were talking about something else entirely and she said, 'my mother died of a botched, illegal abortion,' almost out of the blue, and her story just unfurled from there. I honestly didn't think too much about what my grandmother shared. I didn't think her story was shocking or novel, maybe because abortion had been legal in all 50 states for my whole life. I assumed everyone else in our family knew, so I didn't think to say anything. A couple years later, I was catching up with my parents and one of them said, 'Did you know Great-Grandma Sally died from a botched illegal abortion?' That's when I realised my grandma was nervous when she shared her mother's cause of death with me. She was holding on to this family history and likely carrying with her the shame and stigma or the 'don't talk about it' attitude of her family. It was an 'aha' moment for me - a real understanding that likely everyone has a family abortion story, whether they know it or not. Now our family has a deep understanding that when abortion is legal, abortion is safe. And we know in the decades before Roe v. Wade was decided, people like my great-grandmother were desperate to receive the care they needed.' - Amy Handler, 35, from Oregon",

The results mean that Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill -- who has served as deputy first minister from 2020 -- should be appointed as first minister, a post the DUP had held for two decades. Under Northern Ireland's power-sharing system, the jobs of first minister and deputy first minister are split between the biggest unionist party and the largest nationalist one. Both posts must be filled for a government to function. The post of first minister has the same constitutional weight as the deputy post, but the change to Sinn Fein represents a symbolic shift in Northern Irish politics and could lead to questions around Irish reunification intensifying. However, under the 1998 Good Friday agreement, it is up to the British government to call a referendum if they believe a 'yes' majority looks likely on both sides of the border. Opinion polls have consistently shown most voters in Northern Ireland favour the status quo. The DUP has already suggested it may not be willing to serve under a Sinn Fein first minister, a situation that would plunge Northern Ireland into further uncertainty and would almost certainly guarantee another election. O'Neill used her formal victory speech on Saturday afternoon to send a message to the DUP. She said that the electorate wanted politicians to get working on solving everyday issues, such as the healthcare waiting lists and the rising cost of living. 'And that's the reason why on Monday we must all turn up together,' O'Neill said. 'That's the reason why on Monday, there is an urgency to restore an Executive and start putting money back in people's pockets, to start to fix the health service. The people can't wait. 'I will lead my team to Stormont on Monday. The people have told us during the course of this election that they expect us to work together. The people are right.' A standout factor in the DUP's backsliding at this year's elections has largely been attributed to dissatisfaction with Brexit and the Northern Irish protocol, which has resulted in checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, disrupting trade. The arrangement was designed to maintain an open border between Northern Ireland and the republic, which remains a member of the EU.   It was considered essential to honour the peace process and to prevent the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland, but some unionists believe it creates a barrier with the rest of the UK and undermines their British identity.    The DUP has also said it will refuse to join a new government unless there are major changes to the post-Brexit border arrangements under the Northern Ireland Protocol. In February, the DUP's Paul Givan resigned as first minister in protest at the protocol, meaning O'Neill also automatically lost her post. Reflecting on his party's performance shortly after he was re-elected in Lagan Valley, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said one the 'key messages...is that unionism simply can't afford the divisions that exist'. 'The DUP is very much in the game at the moment,' he added. 'I have made it clear we need the government to take decisive action on the protocol. Words are not enough.'  Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis encouraged the parties to form an Executive 'as soon as possible'. He said: 'The people of Northern Ireland deserve a stable and accountable local government that delivers on the issues that matter most to them.  'The electorate delivered a number of messages on Thursday. They were clear that they want a fully functioning devolved government in Northern Ireland, they want the issues around the Protocol addressed, and that they want politics to work better.' Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Peter Kyle said his party could act as an 'honest broker'. Congratulating new assembly members, he said: 'It is healthy for Northern Ireland that parties from either community can nominate a first minister and shows the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement working. 'Unionism will still have a strong voice within powersharing and calls for progress on the remaining issues of the protocol have been heard and should not prevent a return to the executive. 'The Government must now prioritise practical solutions through negotiation with the EU and not chase headlines with empty threats.'",

The party's chief whip has written to Conservative MPs offering them help following on from 'serious issues' raised in parliament. In an email, seen by HuffPost UK, Chris Heaton-Harris said they needed to do more to 'improve the culture' at Westminster. It comes after a number of female Tory MPs raised serious concerns about misogyny and sexism within their own party.  Heaton-Harris said he had asked MPs Amanda Solloway and Rebecca Harris to look at how they can 'better respond to any welfare issues'. He also revealed that foreign office minister Amanda Milling has been asked to set up a 'support group' for colleagues. The group will be made up of a 'cross-section of colleagues' dedicated to providing support and guidance on a range of matters, he said. The intervention comes just days after Tory Neil Parish resigned as an MP after admitting he watched pornography twice in the Commons. Two female colleagues claimed they had seen him looking at adult content on his phone while sitting near them. The concerns were raised during a heated meeting in which a string of female MPs complained to the whips about sexism and misogyny within the party. The scandal prompted senior Tory MP Caroline Nokes to say her party was institutionally sexist and that there was a culture of 'male entitlement' Heaton-Harris said the Conservatives had 'some of the best and most dedicated' MPs, but added: 'It has become apparent we need to do more to improve the culture we work in and ensure parliament is a welcome place for everyone.' The chief whip went on to encourage MPs to 'reach out' and said if anyone raised concerns they would remain 'private and confidential'. Five years on from the so-called 'pestminster' scandal, parliament was once again engulfed in allegations of misogyny, bullying and sleaze. A senior MP was accused of repeatedly licking the faces of male researchers in parliamentary bars. It was also alleged that a female Tory MP was sent an explicit photograph, known as a 'dick pic', by a male colleague and another MP has reportedly been repeatedly warned about his use of prostitutes. The allegations have led to calls for a major overhaul of parliament's culture.  It led to the Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle to call for a review of current working practices.",

Towards the end of last year, the three-piece announced that they would be taking a break from the group after 11 years together when their Confetti tour comes to an end. However, in an interview with The Sun, they made it clear that they didn't intend for their hiatus to be a permanent one, admitting they're already thinking about reunion plans. 'Honestly, we haven't even parted ways yet and we're already talking about when we're coming back!' Perrie Edwards told the newspaper. 'We're like, 'is two years away enough? Two and a bit years?'.' Jade Thirlwall agreed: 'You can't deny our relationship - whenever anyone comes to watch the show or sees us in interviews or on social media it's pretty obvious that we can't actually live without each other. 'We know how phenomenal we are together, so why would we never want to do that again? Change has to happen in life, you have to move on at some point and try new things, but it's such a comfort to know we have each other to come back to. 'We don't know how long this will be for but I'm already ready for that reunion!' The band members also said there wouldn't be any rivalries between them when they launch their solo endeavours, insisting their friendship is more important than solo success. 'We've all said we will let each other know when we're going to release so we don't end up clashing in the charts,' Perrie explained. 'We're rooting for each other, not competing against each other.' Leigh-Anne Pinnock added: 'We are so close and that's the thing. We're all going to be in communication about this the whole time.'  Little Mix were put together by the judges on The X Factor in 2011, after auditioning as four solo artists, and went on to win the show. In 2020, band member Jesy Nelson announced she was leaving the group, telling fans at the time that being part of Little Mix was taking its toll on her mental health. While all parties initially maintained that Jesy's exit from Little Mix was amicable, this appeared to have changed somewhat by the end of last year, when they admitted they were no longer in touch with one another amid speculation of a fall-out. Little Mix's final show on their Confetti tour will take place at the O2 Arena, London on 14 May, but will also be live-streamed so fans around the world can watch what promises to be an emotional farewell for the chart-topping band.",

The former Weakest Link host took over the reins of Countdown from departing presenter Nick Hewer last year, following his 10-year stint at the helm. Earlier this week, Anne announced that she would be leaving the Channel 4 gameshow later this year, claiming she'd already 'stayed longer than I signed up for'. In a new interview with The Telegraph, she spoke more in depth about the decision, admitting that while it was 'great fun and I loved it for a year', she had no desire to do another. 'I just thought: 'You don't have to do this. And maybe you've now done enough',' she told the newspaper. Asked whether this meant she was done with just Countdown or television in general, she said: 'Of TV. I think I've done it, actually. I thought it was a nice swansong. I suppose I am, yeah, retired.' Throughout Anne's stint on Countdown, she has been at the centre of speculation about a supposed rift with co-star Rachel Riley, though she has repeatedly dismissed this. Anne's replacement is yet to be announced, and while Richard Osman and Carol Vorderman have been named as potential successors in the media, both stars have downplayed this on their respective Twitter accounts. Announcing her exit earlier this week, Anne said: 'I've had a blast hosting this wonderful show. And I stayed longer than I signed up for. Now it is time for an older woman to take the reins.' The 77-year-old star added that she hopes to have changed people's perceptions on what older women are capable of, stating: 'I hope too I've encouraged TV bosses to realise that not all women at the wrong end of their seventies are in care homes playing bingo and watching conjuring tricks.'",

Jo Stevens said Labour were 'confident' no Covid rules had been broken when Starmer was pictured with a beer while campaigning in Durham last year. However, local police announced yesterday that they were launching a fresh investigation into whether he broke lockdown rules. Asked if Starmer should resign if he is found to have broken the law, Stevens told Times Radio: 'Well, I think if we get to that situation, which I think is extremely unlikely on the basis that Durham police have already investigated this complaint and found that no rules have been broken, I'm sure Keir will make a statement at that point, but I think that this is a non story, a kind of smear that's been going on to time with the local elections to try and hold up a Tory party that is so badly damaged by the behaviour of the prime minister.' The shadow Welsh secretary went on to insist that 'no breach' of the rules occurred and added: 'We're confident of that.' Durham Police announced they would launch an investigation into the so-called beergate row following 'significant new information'. The Labour leader is under pressure over footage of him drinking a beer and having a curry with colleagues in April 2021 while campaigning for the Hartlepool by-election. At the time of the gathering, non-essential retail and outdoor venues including pub gardens were open but social distancing rules, which included a ban on indoor mixing between households, remained in place. Boris Johnson has already been issued a fine by police for breaking his own lockdown laws. But Durham police have been asked by Conservative MP Richard Holden to reconsider their initial assessment that no offence was committed by Starmer. Starmer has said no rules were broken as it was just a short break for a meal during work. In a statement, the force said: 'Earlier this year, Durham Constabulary carried out an assessment as to whether Covid-19 regulations had been breached at a gathering in Durham City on April 30 2021. 'At that time, it was concluded that no offence had been established and therefore no further action would be taken. 'Following the receipt of significant new information over recent days, Durham Constabulary has reviewed that position and now, following the conclusion of the pre-election period, we can confirm that an investigation into potential breaches of Covid-19 regulations relating to this gathering is now being conducted.' Starmer said: 'As I've explained a number of times, we were working in the office, we stopped for something to eat. No party, no breach of the rules. 'The police obviously have got their job to do. We should let them get on with it but I'm confident no rules were broken.'",

On Friday evening, it was announced that Rose will follow in the footsteps of stars including Tom Hardy, Rege-Jean Page, Dolly Parton and Kate Middleton by appearing in the story corner. The EastEnders star will become the first person in history to sign a story on CBeebies, telling the tale of Can Bears Ski? using British Sign Language. Her segment will air on Sunday night, to mark the end of Deaf Awareness Week. Can Bears Ski? Centres around a young bear and his father on their journey into the discovery and management of deafness. The book draws on author Raymond Antrobus' experiences to show how isolating it can be for a deaf child in a hearing world.  Rose said: 'I am super excited to read my first CBeebies bedtime story in British Sign Language and it's even more wonderful to share a story written by a deaf writer. 'I hope deaf children enjoy the story and it inspires hearing children to want to learn BSL more.' During her appearance - which will be subtitled - Rose will speak aloud only at the beginning and end of the segment, to introduce her story and say good night to viewers. Last year, Rose made history as the first deaf contestant to compete on Strictly, going on to win the show with professional partner Giovanni Pernice. This weekend, Rose and Giovanni are in the running for the Must-See TV Moment award at the TV Baftas for their routine to Clean Bandit's Symphony, which included an emotional section performed in complete silence.",
    "426d531649ebc0165a8943bd740df86787a5b5dbd3965ef3551ddeaf": "Rachel Riley has admitted she's grown tired of having her relationship cited as an example of the so-called Strictly Come Dancing 'curse'. Over the years, Strictly has become synonymous with what the media refers to as the show's 'curse' which has seen several celebrity contestants' relationships ending during or after their time on the show, many of whom then end up getting together with their professional partners. The Countdown presenter competed on Strictly in 2013, and shortly after the show ended she split from her ex-husband, later announcing that she and her former dancer partner Pasha Kovalev were an item. Rachel and Pasha have now been married for almost two years, and have two children together. During an appearance on the podcast Dirty Mother Pukka, the Maths expert was asked when she first fell in love with Pasha, insisting it was long after their time on Strictly together. 'That wasn't until much later,' she explained, noting that 'at the time I did it I was married'. When asked for her feelings about the Strictly 'curse', Rachel continued: 'I mean I still get it, I'm never going to avoid it. 'But now it's like, you know, we've got two children. At what point can you just not call my children 'the Strictly curse'?' She added that her appearance on Strictly was now almost a decade ago, telling the host she 'only had to answer to myself and my family'. Last year, Rachel admitted that Strictly is something she now intentionally avoids, having undergone therapy for PTSD after her time on the show. 'I needed cognitive behavioural therapy after competing in 2013 and developed post-traumatic stress disorder,' she said. 'If I heard the theme music, I'd start reliving the experience. It was scary and unnerving, so my way of dealing with it is to avoid watching.' Rachel previously claimed she'd advised famous pals against taking part, and also knows others who 'have dropped out of it due to the mental pressures involved'.",
    "f08eec30ca28f2ba8fb5fc7f3a19a8d6f8917f574c39104343536764": "A cabinet minister today urged Tory MPs not to move against Boris Johnson following heavy local election losses. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi also insisted the prime minister remained an electoral asset to the Conservative Party. It comes after the Tories lost almost 500 seats and control of 11 councils in the local elections. Many Tory MPs considered the vote a referendum on Johnson's premiership and are now weighing up whether or not to move against him. In a message to Tory colleagues, Zahawi told Sky News: 'People don't like to vote for split parties, for teams that are divided. 'We are strongest when we are united, we've got a Queen's Speech next week where we will demonstrate to the nation that the second half of this parliament is all about dealing with repairing the economy, recovering from Covid, the backlog of the NHS and national security - here at home, safer streets - and, of course, abroad. All of these things we have a plan for. 'We are stronger when we are united and that would be my message to all my colleagues.' Pressed on whether Johnson was still an electoral asset for the party, Zahawi insisted: 'He is an asset, absolutely...If you look at the way that Boris cuts through in places like Nuneaton, places like Newcastle-under-Lyme, other parts of the country as well - Harrow in London.' The results are fuelling speculation over Johnson's leadership, with some MPs blaming the losses on the prime minister.  Tory MP Aaron Bell, a critic of the PM, said the issue of Johnson's leadership had to be 'brought to a head'. Bell, who has already submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson, told BBC Radio 4's Today: 'It's not really up to me, it's up to my colleagues and I'm sure when we get back to Westminster there will be a discussion about that. 'What I do think is it needs to be brought to a head sooner rather than later because I don't think we can continue having this hanging over the party for many more months to come, with the Metropolitan Police and Sue Gray and then the Privileges Committee.' The Newcastle-under-Lyme MP said it was a 'perfectly reasonable' position for colleagues to wait until the publication of senior official Gray's report on the alleged lockdown-busting parties in No.10 and Whitehall. However, he said they 'do need to bring this to a head, one way or another, so that we can draw a line under this'.  HuffPost UK has heard that staff working for some leadership hopefuls have been trying to 'tap-up' MPs for support for weeks.   One MP has also admitted they are a campaign manager-in-waiting for one hopeful.   Some MPs think any leadership challenge must take place in a 'window of opportunity' soon after the local election results are announced or Johnson will likely be taking them into the next general election.   However, it all depends on whether enough letters of no confidence have been submitted to chairman of the 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady.   One senior backbencher is said to be in 'full-on manoeuvres' as MPs across the party say they have been approached by his staff. Yesterday No.10 aides were told the prime minister was 'buoyant about the future' after the local elections, according to The Times. David Canzini, a senior aide to the PM, reportedly showed staff statistics from previous mid-term elections in 2000, 2004 and 2009 when the Tories had performed strongly only to do less well at subsequent elections and told them: 'The sky hasn't fallen in and we've got to keep going.'    Speaking on a visit to Ruislip, north-west London, Johnson said yesterday: 'It is mid-term. It's certainly a mixed set of results.     'We had a tough night in some parts of the country, but on the other hand, in other parts of the country you are still seeing Conservatives going forward and making quite remarkable gains in places that haven't voted Conservative for a long time, if ever.'

The TV presenter has been involved in Eurovision since 2018, when he took over as one of the BBC's commentators during the semi-final stages of the competition. Speaking ahead of this year's contest, Rylan told The Sun it's become something of a 'tradition' for him to take the UK's representative out on the town in whatever country Eurovision is being held in - though this hasn't always gone down so well with organisers. 'It is tradition that I always take the British act out, normally on the Wednesday or the Thursday,' he explained. 'And then the head of delegation always has a go at me because I take them out.' Rylan was quick to add that, even after his upcoming night out with UK singer Sam Ryder, he'll 'make sure Sam is alright by Saturday night'. This year's Eurovision Song Contest is being held in Turin, Italy following rock group Maneskin's victory in 2021. After the UK infamously fell to the bottom of the leaderboard last year with nul points, things are looking somewhat more promising this time around.

Founded by biomedical scientist, Professor Augustinus Bader, the brand is informed by his work in regenerative stem cell medicine, including treating burns victims, leadin him to develop a range of active creams and serums.  Bader found that rapid regeneration of skin cells along with exfoliation improves the appearance and softness of ageing skin, and helps peel away dark spots and blemishes. Over time, it also improves acne and reduces wrinkles. Friends co-stars Courteney Cox and Jennifer Aniston, Britpack's Alexa Chung and Emma Corrin, pop royalty (Lizzo) and even actual royalty (Meghan Markle) have all used them - not to mention Hollywood types like Charlize Theron, Salma Hakek and Leonardo Dicaprio (yes, men can look after their skin, too).

    "88e98cb913a9836b23200ca98aa231c40ad297ac040e9fc353a7d78d": "Every year on Mother's Day, I see people post old family photos on social media with captions praising mums for all the ways they prioritised their kids' needs at the expense of their own. 'You dropped whatever you were doing to help us.' 'You never bought anything for yourself so we could have whatever we wanted.' 'You made it to every one of my baseball games, no matter what else you had going on.' The posts are sweet, appreciative and written with the best of intentions. But they perpetuate this narrative that being a good mum means being a martyr.  'Sacrificing yourself as a person is still very much what's expected in this culture as a mother,' Georgetown University women's studies lecturer Elizabeth Velez, who co-teaches a class called Reading Motherhood tells HuffPost.  In recent years, there's been more acknowledgment that moms bear the brunt of domestic labour - both visible and invisible - whether or not they work outside the home. Mums are told they deserve self-care for their tireless efforts and they need to find time to practise it. But have these conversations actually lightened their load? Or have they just added more to their already very full plates?  People will point out that the martyr mentality is damaging and, in the next breath, glorify mums for attempting to 'do it all.' Many women still feel immense pressure, internal and external, to keep all the balls in the air at the expense of their own well-being.  The unyielding pressure of intensive othering  The expectation that women devote so much of their time and energy to raising kids really took off in the 1980s and 1990s -- the same time that more and more women were participating in the workforce. In 1996, sociologist Sharon Hays coined the term 'intensive mothering' to describe this parenting ideology, which is 'child-centered, expert-guided, emotionally absorbing, labor-intensive and financially expensive.'  Being a 'good mum' came to mean making everyday interactions with your child intellectually stimulating, filling your afternoons and weekends with enriching extracurricular activities and staying up to date on the latest parenting guidance.  Now, women were expected to excel in their careers while also expanding -- not reducing - their parenting responsibilities. According to a 2013 Pew Research survey, mums today actually spend more time with their kids than mothers did in the 1960s.  A 2018 nationally representative survey of more than 3,600 parents found that this intensive parenting style is what most parents, regardless of race and class, still aspire to today. Writer and activist Glennon Doyle aptly summed up how the expectations put on mums have greatly increased over the last few generations in her 2020 book Untamed. In one chapter, she spells out three hypothetical 'memos' women of different generations received when leaving the hospital with their babies. Her grandmother's memo would go as follows: 'Here is the baby. Take it home and let it grow. Let it speak when spoken to. Carry on with your lives.' Her mother's memo would say: 'Here is your baby. Take her home and then get together each day with your friends who also have these things. Drink Tab before four o'clock and wine coolers after. Smoke cigarettes and play cards. Lock the kids out of the house and let them in only to eat and sleep.' This generation's memo, however, is a lot more involved:  Here is your baby. This is the moment you have been waiting for your entire life: when the hole in your heart is filled and you finally become complete. If, after I put this child in your arms, you sense anything other than utter fulfillment, seek counseling immediately. After you hang up with the counselor, call a tutor. Since we have been speaking for three minutes, your child is already behind. Have you registered her for Mandarin classes yet? I see. Poor child. Listen closely: Parent is no longer a noun -- those days are done. Parent is now a verb, something you do ceaselessly. Think of the verb parent as synonymous with protect, shield, hover, deflect, fix, plan, and obsess. Parenting will require all of you; please parent with your mind, body, and soul. Parenting is your new religion, within which you will find salvation. This child is your savior. Convert or be damned. We will wait while you cancel all other life endeavors. Thank you.  And that's precisely why mums in today's generation feel so 'exhausted, neurotic, and guilty,' Doyle writes. Mummy martyrdom isn't good for mums - and it's not good for kids, either The cumulative effect of neglecting your own wants and needs for your kids' takes a toll and can leave you stressed, exhausted and resentful. According to Motherly's 2021 State of Motherhood survey, 93% of mothers say they feel burned out at least some of the time - with 16% reporting feeling that way all the time. A 2012 study from the University of Mary Washington found that women who endorsed intensive mothering beliefs were more likely to experience negative mental health outcomes like depression and lower life satisfaction.  Psychologist Becky Kennedy, known on the internet as Dr. Becky, tells HuffPost that societal messaging about maternal sacrifice sets up 'a very unsustainable vision around parenthood' - a concept she's discussed on her Instagram account and podcast 'Good Inside.'  We think our kids want us to sacrifice our needs for them when that's likely not the case, Kennedy says. When they see that we're afraid to do things for ourselves because they might tantrum or protest, they feel 'way too powerful' she says - likening it to a kid running into the cockpit of an airplane and trying to take over as pilot.  'Even if they're knocking down the cockpit door, it would terrify them if the pilot opened the door and let them take over,' Kennedy says. 'And so we need to realise as parents that taking care of our own needs is part of being a sturdy leader to your family. In that way, taking care of your own needs is really a way you're taking care of your kids.'  Consider also the message we're sending our kids when we neglect our own needs time and time again and praise other women for doing the same. As writer Christine Organ wrote for the Washington Post, painting mums as some kind of 'tireless, selfless superhuman' isn't good for anyone, 'least of all, our children.' 'I don't want my children to view me as some kind of self-sacrificing martyr; I want them to know that I loved them with all my heart and that they are part of a family - as well as a larger community - which means that their needs cannot always come first,' she wrote. What can we do to address this? Certainly, there are larger social issues that contribute to mums feeling like they have to do it all for their families. The US is one of few countries worldwide with no national paid parental leave. Good child care is often prohibitively expensive. The gender pay gap plays a role, too: because women generally earn less than their male partners, when one partner needs to step away from work to take care of the kids or a sick relative, it's often the woman - which only perpetuates the cycle. Then there's the fact that mums, whether they work outside the home or not, are often considered the primary parent. If there's an issue at school or the paediatrician's office has a question, whom do they call? Mum, of course.  'I don't know why in 2022 we still have this idea that women are better nurturers than men and that women are in the central caretaking role,' says Georgetown English professor Pamela Fox, who co-teaches the Reading Motherhood class with Velez. We can't reverse these deeply entrenched patterns overnight. But there are smaller things we can do within our own families to change the 'motherhood is martyrdom' narrative - and cut ourselves some slack in the process.  Tell your partner what you need from them, and then actually let them do it.  Ask for and accept help. Say you're not able to take on the brunt of the household and parenting duties anymore.  'We can't expect one person to do almost all of it,' Fox says. 'That's just totally unfair.'  Offloading some of your tasks onto your partner requires giving up control. Resist the urge to micromanage: Your partner may not do things the way you would, but they'll get done. And that's good enough. Say 'no' to others so you can 'yes' to yourself more.  As women, we've been socialized to be accommodating, which can make saying 'no' seem so difficult.  'We so often say 'yes' to favours, requests and unrealistic parenting expectations because we fear being accused of being rude, mean or - shock horror - selfish (one of the worst things you can call a woman in our culture that fetishises female self-sacrifice),' journalist Grace Jennings-Edquist wrote in an essay for The Guardian.  Practise tolerating other people's disappointment. When you start asserting your needs more, expect some pushback from your partner, kids or the other people in your life. For people-pleasing martyr types, that can be quite uncomfortable.  'There's this idea that, 'OK I'm going to stand up for what I need. I'm going to say I'm going to that exercise class.' And everyone around me is going to be happy for me so that will make it easier to go,' Kennedy says.  'No. When we stand up for what we need, we often do get pushback because sometimes it is an inconvenience to a partner to watch your kids while you're exercising.' In other words, we can't wait for other people to give us permission or tell us we deserve it. We just have to do it. And the more we do it, the easier it becomes.  Do more of what excites you outside of raising kids.  In an essay for The Week, A. Rochaun Meadows-Fernandez - a writer, activist and mother of two -- said that long before she had kids, she internalised the message that becoming a mom would mean giving up 'the enjoyable aspects of [her] life.' Eventually, she realised how unfair this expectation was and how unhappy it was making her, so she stopped putting her life on hold. 'I decided to detach myself from 'if only I weren't a parent' ways of thinking... And I started living differently,' Meadows-Fernandez wrote.  'Instead of staying home when I didn't have access to a sitter, I would bring my children with me to community meetings,' she continued. 'I stopped apologising when I had to shift work deadlines for my family. I volunteered for opportunities that interested me ... and made a career out of talking about the emotional stressors that accompanied Black motherhood. The more I did the more I realised that I didn't have to reduce my impact because I was a mother.'   Know that prioritising your needs will set a good example for your kids. Last May, I was eight months pregnant, writing a Mother's Day card to my own mum, whom I hadn't seen in over a year because of the pandemic. I thought about thanking her for the sacrifices - big and small - she had made for her kids over the years. But what stood out to me more were the things she chose not to sacrifice. She didn't breastfeed because she didn't want to. She continued working in a career she found rewarding. She went to the gym every morning because it helped energise her for the day ahead. She carved out time on Sunday nights to watch TV with my stepdad, no kids allowed. She led by example, showing me the importance of prioritising the things that make you *you* even after you have kids.  That Sunday, I woke up to a text from my mom that said: 'I'm glad I set that example for you guys because it's an important lesson. It's possible to be a great mom, daughter, sister, spouse, employee, manager, friend, but only if you make your physical, mental and spiritual well-being a priority.' And since becoming a mum myself, I've taken those words to heart.  This is part of a HuffPost Parents series called Enjoy the Ride. Read more here.",

Mike appeared in a string of Friends episodes between 1995 and 2001, playing Mr Treeger, the superintendent of Monica, Rachel, Joey and Chandler's apartment building. Treeger's most memorable appearance is in the episode The One With The Ballroom Dancing, in which Joey helps him perfect a dance routine in a bid to stop him evicting Rachel and Monica from the building. A post on Friends' official social media account said: 'The Friends family is mourning the loss of Mike Hagerty, our very own Mr. Treeger. Our thoughts are with his family, friends, colleagues, and fans. Here's to one last dance!' More recently, Mike landed a role in the HBO series Somebody Somewhere, which debuted in America earlier this year. He played Ed Miller, a farmer and the father of central character Sam, played by actor and comedian Bridget Everett. Bridget announced the news of Mike's death on Instagram on Friday, writing: 'With great sadness, the family of Michael G. Hagerty announced his death yesterday in Los Angeles.  'A beloved character actor, his love of his hometown of Chicago and his family were the cornerstones of his life.' Describing Mike as a 'devoted husband', Bridget noted that he is 'survived by his wife Mary Kathryn, his sister Mary Ann Hagerty, her wife Kathleen O'Rourke, and their daughter Meg'. 'He will be sorely missed,' she added. Over the years, Mike acted in sitcoms like Cheers, Married With Children, Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Goldbergs.

Boris GONE-son?: Tories in trouble Make no bones about it, the Conservative Party has lost more than 400 seats and that is not good. For all the talk of a mid-term protest vote against the governing party, the Tories had already been duffed-up the last time the councils were contested four years ago, so hundreds more councillors going on a like-for-like basis should not be glossed over. It's telling the gloss that Boris Johnson's outriders are painting with focuses on Labour's lack of gains, not its own deficit. But there was scathing criticism from within the party, including this damning tweet from ex-MP and former Theresa May adviser Gavin Barwell, who called it a 'wake up call'. But, with Johnson facing a leadership challenge if 53 Tory MPs demand a vote of no confidence, there was little sign they were more prepared to wield the axe. With most critics in Westminster keeping their heads down, it was left it to grassroots Tories to speak out.  John Mallinson, leader of Carlisle City Council, hit out after Labour took control of the new Cumberland authority which will replace it, saying: 'I think it is not just partygate, there is the integrity issue. Basically I just don't feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.' Johnson himself said it had been a 'mixed set of results' for the Tories. 'It is mid-term,' he said, sticking to the script. As the losses notched up, and edged towards 500 seats, a Labour Party spokesperson said: 'This is a shattering result for the Conservatives. 'Boris Johnson was on the ballot paper and the British public has rejected him. 'The question every decent Conservative will be asking themselves is how much further are they willing fall for a man who never fails to put his own interest above his councillors, his MPs, his party, and his country.' Next stop: tricky by-elections in Tiverton and Honiton and Wakefield.  2. Keir, there, everywhere: Labour's contrasting fortunes Labour's performance is open to interpretation, and interpret is what commentators have spent much of the last 12 hours doing. There were the headline grabbing wins in London - flagship Tory councils Wandsworth, Westminster and Barnet fell - and a majority on the newly-created council in Cumberland, which Labour leader Keir Starmer said showed his party could win anywhere. The traditional county-wide authority includes 'Workington Man', a voter demographic that gets pollsters very excited in terms of who might win a general election. There's also something happening for Labour on the coast - it took control of Southampton and Worthing - and the 'sea wall' appears to have entered the political lexicon, joining the 'red wall' and 'blue wall' stolen from US politics. But Labour has gained 252 councils seats - a reflection of the party not pocketing all the Conservative losses. The Tories were briefing how Labour has gone backwards in Sunderland, Tyneside, Hartlepool, Nuneaton, Sandwell and Amber Valley - former heartlands areas in the north and midlands that will be essential to getting back into power in Westminster. But it's progress. An analysis for the BBC by Professor Sir John Curtice calculated that if the whole country had been voting Labour would have gained 35% of the vote - five points ahead of the Tories on 30% - the party's biggest lead in local elections for a decade. Starmer, who is now facing a fresh 'beergate' investigation, proclaimed clear evidence of a Labour revival following its crushing defeat in the 2019 general election. 'This is a big turning point for us,' he told cheering supporters in Barnet. 'We've sent a message to the prime minister: Britain deserves better.' 3. Ravey Davey: The Lib Dem 'comeback' The toxicity surrounding the Liberal Democrats following five years of power sharing with the Conservatives, and hiking tuition fees, seems to be a fading memory. Ed Davey's party have compounded the success in recent Westminster by-elections by taking Hull council and the newly-created Somerset unitary authority. Other wins included Westmorland and Furness and dislodging the Tories in West Oxfordshire. The party has gained 189 seats, which in part explains why Labour's haul looks meagre. The Green Party, too, made substantial progress - gaining 81 councillors. The 'third party' success raises questions over splitting the 'progressive' vote three ways, and whether that would let the Tories back in at a general election by default. Expect to hear more talk about electoral pacts and 'lending' votes. 'What began as a tremor in Chesham and Amersham, became an earthquake in North Shropshire, and is now an almighty shockwave that will bring this Conservative government tumbling down,' Davey said. 4. One love: The SNP march on in Scotland Scotland is increasingly a one-party nation. The SNP claimed its 11th successive national victory, and the number of councillors it boasts has risen in every ballot since 2004. Perhaps more interesting was the race for second place. After years of decline, Labour has made gains and leap-frogged the Conservatives, whose strong performances under Ruth Davidson have gone in reverse now the former party leader in Scotland has left the stage. Improvements in Scotland - coupled with the Lib Dems nibbling away at the Tories in southern England - is part of a complicated route back to Westminster power for Labour. Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross described the results as 'very disappointing', adding that Johnson 'can't ignore the message' from voters. He said: 'The Conservatives lost Westminster Council last night, that's a council that even in the peak Labour years under Tony Blair the party held on to, so there's been a very strong message from the public to the prime minister and to the party.' The actual big story?: Sinn Fein closes in on history While the local elections in England, Scotland and Wales make for good sport for armchair analysts, they may not lead to anything of substance changing. But Northern Ireland's ballot could lead to a seismic shift for the whole of the United Kingdom. Sinn Fein is on the brink of political history if it emerges as the largest party in Northern Ireland following Assembly elections. After years of lagging behind its rival the Democratic Unionist Party, with whom it shares power, the nationalist party has now emerged on top with the potential to change the political landscape. With counting for the 90 Stormont seats continuing on Friday evening, the republican party had won 16 seats, well ahead of the Alliance on four and the DUP and UUP on three. Sinn Fein's position as the largest party would means a poll on the reunification of Ireland is far more likely - and the debate around Northern Ireland withdrawing from the United Kingdom of England, Scotland and Wales would intensify.",

Last summer, eventual winner Millie Court became an internet meme when she sat down at a keyboard for a musical recital during an Island talent show. Social media had a field day with the moment, superimposing Millie and her keyboard into a variety of unexpected scenes.  In the lead up to the eighth series of the ITV2 reality show this summer, she has now been immortalised in plasticine in a new teaser.  Two short promos taken from a full-length trailer have debuted, and see Love Island pitching itself as 'the OG of dating shows', ordering all the pretenders to stand down because 'Love Is Ours'. As they quash their TV rivals, fans then can see a shot of 'Millie' and her keyboard next to the pool as someone performs one of the series' trademark 'salmon' dives.  Both teasers will debut on TV during Saturday's Britain's Got Talent.  Love Island is expected to return to ITV2 in June, and will see the show move to a brand new villa. It has been based at the famous Spanish farmhouse in Sant Llorenc des Cardassar, Mallorca, since 2017, but this year's Islanders will have new premises to explore.  ITV has yet to confirm further details about the series, although married couple Laura Whitmore and Iain Stirling are expected to return to presenting and narrating duties respectively.  There had been speculation ITV was lining up replacements for Laura - with Strictly Come Dancing favourite AJ Odudu and former Islander Maura Higgins both linked to the role in the press - although reports have since suggested she will return for a third series.

The Conservatives lost councillors across the country as they dropped to third place behind Labour and the SNP. Allies of Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross blamed the partygate scandal at Westminster and Boris Johnson's unpopularity north of the border for the dramatic downturn in the party's fortunes. But others said Ross's decision to withdraw his call for the prime minister's resignation had damaged the Tories' electoral prospects. After the results in all 32 Scottish councils were in, the Conservatives saw their share of the vote slump to 19.6 per cent, nearly 6 points down on 2017, while they also lost 62 seats, leaving them with 215. The SNP have consolidated their place as Scotland's pre-eminent political party with 34.1 per cent and 454 seats, with Labour on 21.7 per cent and 281 seats. It was also a good night for the Lib Dems, who saw their number of seats increase by 20 to 87, while the Greens are up 15 seats to 34. Adam Tomkins, a former Scottish Conservative MSP, rejected suggestions from some within the party that the PM was to blame for the Tories' poor performance. He tweeted: 'I'm sorry but this is nonsense. Whatever today's results show Douglas Ross owns this, not Boris. It was Douglas who u-turned, Douglas who flipped, and Douglas who backed the PM. He and his team need to own the consequences, not pass the buck.' And Liz Smith, the Tories' finance spokesperson at Holyrood, said: 'Douglas will have to explain why he is defending him as prime minister but blaming him for the result. Douglas will have to explain the two sides of that coin.' But a supporter of Ross pointed out that the Tories were also suffering a bad night in England. They told HuffPost UK: 'I think it's unhelpful for people within the Scottish party to be pointing accusing fingers at Douglas when we've been losing councils like Wandsworth and Westminster. There may just be a wider narrative here.' Ian Blackford, the SNP's leader at Westminster, said voters in Scotland had 'sent a message' to Boris Johnson. He said: 'The important story from Scotland is the fact that the Tories are being rejected. 'Their vote is down and I think what really is important today is that the voters have sent a message to Boris Johnson. 'I think there's two things that count; one is of course the cost-of-living crisis - more needs to be done, and the other issue is partygate. 'I think people in Scotland have made it very clear that they want no more of this from Boris Johnson and his Conservatives.'",

The Labour leader has come under pressure since footage emerged of him drinking a beer with colleagues in April 2021 in Durham, during campaigning for the Hartlepool by-election. At the time of the gathering, non-essential retail and outdoor venues including pub gardens were open but social distancing rules, which included a ban on indoor mixing between households, remained in place. Boris Johnson has already been issued a fine by police for breaking his own lockdown laws. But Durham police have been asked by Conservative MP Richard Holden to reconsider their initial assessment that no offence was committed by Starmer. Starmer has said no rules were broken as it was just a short break for a meal during work. In a statement, the force said: 'Earlier this year, Durham Constabulary carried out an assessment as to whether Covid-19 regulations had been breached at a gathering in Durham City on April 30 2021. 'At that time, it was concluded that no offence had been established and therefore no further action would be taken. 'Following the receipt of significant new information over recent days, Durham Constabulary has reviewed that position and now, following the conclusion of the pre-election period, we can confirm that an investigation into potential breaches of Covid-19 regulations relating to this gathering is now being conducted.' Starmer said: 'As I've explained a number of times, we were working in the office, we stopped for something to eat. No party, no breach of the rules. 'The police obviously have got their job to do. We should let them get on with it but I'm confident no rules were broken.' Durham Police made the announcement as results of Thursday's local elections continued to roll in. Johnson admitted the Tories endured a 'tough night' after suffering a string of council losses but dismissed calls for him to quit. The prime minister said that he took full responsibility for the results as Labour strengthened its grip on London and the Liberal Democrats also made gains at the Conservatives' expense.",

Here's a breakdown of how this one area became such an essential part of the war. What's happening in Mariupol? The southern port city suffered from intense shelling and brutal attacks very early on in the Russian invasion and the pressure on Mariupol has only intensified since the Kremlin ordered its troops to focus on south-east Ukraine. While the Ukrainians held firm in Mariupol, the Russian forces gradually forced their way into the city.  The Russian president Vladimir Putin then declared victory in Mariupol last week, and now reportedly intends to make the desecrated city a key part of Russia's national holiday celebrations on Monday - but there's an obstacle. There is still a small body of resistance in Azovstal steel plant in the city which is facing intense and continuous attacks from Russian troops. It has evolved into a conflict so fierce it has been compared to the battle of Stalingrad from World War 2, where the Nazis put pressure on hiding Soviet forces. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy also told the UK foreign policy think tank Chatham House that Russia's treatment of Mariupol is 'an example of torture and starvation used as a weapon of war'. 'This inhumanity and cruelty is how the Russia military treats people,' he added. 'Death is not caused by war. This is not a military event. This is torturing to death. This is terrorism and hatred.' What's going on inside Azovstal? The UN secretary general described the steel plant as a series of 'hellscapes' now, due to the repeated bombardment from the Russian forces. The four-mile steel mill, built on the coast in the 1930s, has tunnels built deep underground and bunkers said to protect against even a nuclear blast. The network is so sophisticated it is currently housing around 2,000 Ukrainian fighters and approximately 200 civilians. The UN launched its third rescue mission to 'receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell...and take them back to safety' on Friday. The UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross also claim to have already helped almost 500 civilians flee during their two previous operations in the past week. Around 50 people - including the wives of soldiers currently inside Azovstal - are reportedly trying to negotiate with the Russian military for the release of the Ukrainian soldiers also trapped inside, but to no avail. Why is Russia bombing the steel plant? The Russian troops have not tried to infiltrate the mill because they will be putting themselves in jeopardy, as the Ukrainians hiding within would have the advantage. Instead, Putin called for his forces to besiege the plant. Large bombs are being dropped on the property, but it's unclear if the troops have yet managed to cut off all access to food, water and ammunition. The Ministry of Defence explained in its daily Twitter briefing: 'The renewed effort by Russia to secure Azovstal and complete the capture of Mariupol is likely linked to the upcoming May 9 Victory Day commemorations and Putin's desire to have a symbolic success in Ukraine. 'This effort has come at personnel, equipment and munitions cost to Russia. 'Whilst Ukrainian resistance continues to Azovstal, Russian losses will continue to build and frustrate their operational plans in southern Donbas.' Why is there extra pressure on Russia? Putin is preparing for Victory Day, the annual holiday in Russia of the 1945 defeat of the Nazis. As the Russia president is known to value symbolism and patriotism, he is expected to up the ante and consolidate his minimal victories for the occasion - although the Kremlin has denied that Putin will make any grand declarations of war. Russia is also becoming increasingly reliant on domestic support, because it is becoming so isolated from the international community due to its unprovoked, barbaric attack on Ukraine. Amnesty International has said there is evidence Russian troops have committed war crimes, including 'reckless shootings and torture' outside the capital of Kyiv, although Moscow denies it is responsible for any such crimes. Donatella Rovera, Amnesty's senior crisis response adviser, said: 'These are not isolated incidents. These are very much part of a pattern wherever Russian forces were in control of a town or a village.' Meanwhile, there have been reports of Russians fleeing the country due to the war, undermining support Putin is reliant on back home. Journalist Alec Luhn tweeted that around 3.8 million people - 'most of the pro-Western, opposition-minded folks' - fled Russia during the first quarter of the year. However, he suggested this could even work in Putin's favour, as he added: 'Don't hold your breath for a revolution.' ",

The brand has teamed up with model and body positivity advocate Charli Howard for a collection named 'Sorry not sorry: A celebration of confidence with Charli Howard'. The range includes a leopard print plunge swimsuit, a hot pink one shouldered bikini, and a white plunge swimsuit with cut-outs. In a video promoting the range, Howard says: 'I'm done with the pressure of other people's expectations. This summer I'm celebrating everything that makes me, me.' 'I'm loving the skin I'm in... own that beautiful body. Empower yourself and wear the bikini you want. Love every fold, every dimple, every curve. 'Forget beauty standards. We look damn good.' Howard, 31, has spoken up widely about body issues and in 2018 published her first book, Misfit, which explained how her experiences of eating disorders and anxiety directly led to her becoming a model and advocate. However, not everyone sees the collaboration from River Island as a step in the right direction. Social media users have been pointing out the mixed messaging of asking shoppers to 'forget beauty standards' when the campaign features a mid-sized model and the swimwear being sold doesn't cater to shoppers above a size 18. Influencer and writer Stephanie Yeboah aired her frustrations in a Twitter thread about the new campaign, which she says represents the complete opposite of body positivity.  Yeboah, who is the author of Fattily Ever After: A Black Fat Girl's Guide to Living Life Unapologetically, went on to say: 'It's so tiring as a plus-size content creator who works within the body image sector to constantly see brands use the body positivity movement to further push this mid-size trend, whilst leaving out the bodies that need it the most.' It's those bodies that are 'most marginalised' and any campaign that excludes them should not frame itself around body positivity, self-love or confidence, she added. Yeboah, 33, also highlighted the role of women of colour as pioneers of the body positivity movement and called for better allyship from mid-sized models. The plus-sized influencer said she had also worked with River Island in the past, but felt duty bound to call out this behaviour as a 'huge misstep' from the brand. As well as the language of the campaign being at odds with the casting of Howard as a mid-size model, Yeboah took issue with the swimwear only being available in size 6 to 18 - and she wasn't the only one. Several influencers have called out the brand for inviting plus-sized guests to the launch of the line, 'knowing' they wouldn't be able to wear the pieces.

The BBC News host was up at the crack to present the early morning bulletin that was dominated by Labour and Lib Dems making gains in the local elections. But things got derailed temporarily, by Huw's pastry. Wiping his lips, Huw told viewers: 'I'm going to admit to you that I've just had a little bit of croissant and I'm just finishing it, I'm ashamed to say that but there you go... it's um, twenty to six in the morning.' Minutes later, things went decidedly Alan Partridge when Huw got political scientist Sir John Curtice, who was in a different part of the studio crunching the numbers from yesterday's local elections, involved. 'I'm just wondering if Sir John Curtice has been helping himself to French patisserie this morning as he's chomping through his data,' Huw said. 'I was just about to say Huw, whether you were going to send them up to us, they've certainly not reached here yet,' John replied. Twitter was here for all of the flaky Friday chit chat... And Huw wasn't the only newsreader getting in on the eating-while-reading-the-news-action... When will this madness end? We're predicting Clive Myrie has a muffin during the News at 10.",
    "ad05f5ea16337a423d6165ead93629ccccbef0f06825148154982512": "Ed Davey has hailed the local elections results as a 'historic moment' for the Lib Dems, as his party picked up seats from the Conservatives across the south of England. Speaking on Friday morning, the Lib Dem leader said the victories were a 'turning point' that proved the party was on course to pick up MPs at the next general election. It was, Davey said, 'an almighty shockwave that will bring this Conservative government tumbling down'. The party was all but wiped out in Westminster in 2015, after it went into coalition with the Conservatives, when it lost 49 of its 57 MPs. It currently has 13. In the south west, an area of the country that used to be a Lib Dem stronghold, the party seized control of Somerset council, which has been run by the Conservatives since 2009. The victory is huge a boost to the Lib Dems ahead of the Tiverton and Honiton by-election, triggered by the resignation of Tory MP Neil Parish, soon to take place in neighbouring Devon. Lib Dems are hoping to repeat their stunning recent by-election successes in Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire, which saw huge swings against the Conservatives. Davey will also be eyeing up the Somerset seat of Somerton and Frome, where the incumbent MP David Warburton has had the Tory whip suspended following allegations of sexual harassment and cocaine use. In West Oxfordshire, David Cameron's backyard, the Tories lost control of the council for the first time in 22 years after the Lib Dems picked up eight of the 16 seats available.  While in Wokingham, home to veteran Tory MP John Redwood, the Lib Dems gained five seats pushing the council into no overall control. The Lib Dems gained a further nine seats in Richmond-upon-Thames, where they took control from the Conservatives in 2018. And in Wimbledon, the Tories were knocked into third by the Lib Dems on Merton Council. In Eastleigh, on the south coast, the party won all but one seat, despite Boris Johnson having campaigned there earlier this week. Beyond the south, a highlight for the party was also winning control of Hull. Labour's outgoing council leader in the city, Daren Hale, blamed the defeat on the collapse of the Tory vote. In Cheadle, a key target for the Lib Dems in Westminster elections, the party picked up two of the available three council seats. Just as Labour is hoping to win back the so-called Red Wall seats in the north, the Lib Dems are targeting what they have dubbed the Tory 'Blue Wall' in the south. Layla Moran, the Lib Dem MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, said the results 'across the country' showed people were 'putting their trust in the Lib Dems again' 'Not just in no-longer-true-blue Surrey and Oxfordshire but also in Northern Labour strongholds like Hull, people are turning to our party as an antidote to complacency and incompetence,' she told HuffPost UK. 'It's been a good day, but the bigger picture is how this tallies with our Westminster by-election wins last year and the number of close seconds that we can convert in the future. The Lib Dems definitely have a spring in our step today.' But Tory MP Bim Afolami said much of the Lib Dem vote was a 'protest' against a mid-term government rather than an indication of how the next election would go. 'A lot of people have told me they want to protest,' he told Sky News. A surge in the Lib Dem vote in the south will worry many Tory MPs ahead of the general election, not least deputy prime minister Dominic Raab, who only holds his Esher and Walton seat in Surrey by just 2,743 votes. The Tories have complained about a secret pact between Labour and the Lib Dems to maximise Conservative pain in marginals, something denied by both opposition parties. Even if Labour is unable to win back all its old northern seats at the next election, a substantial squeeze of the Tories in the south by the Lib Dems could put the Tory majority in jeopardy.  While there might not be a formal alliance, Sarah Olney, the Lib Dem MP for Richmond Park, said it was 'probably fair' to say in England her party was focussing efforts on the south. 'A lot of our targets at the next election are Tory seats,' she told the BBC. 'Those parts of the country are definitely parts of the country we are interested in.' Previous Lib Dem hopes of a revival in fortunes have not come to pass however. At the 2019 election then-leader Jo Swinson said it was a realistic possibility she could become prime minister. But she lost her seat and the party won just 11 MPs.",
    "d22d507b15875e4241a5ad4f1de4278dfab25500aecb658e0c24bd29": "The Omicron variant is less likely to trigger long Covid among double-vaccinated people, according to new data. Omicron caused widespread alarm when it first emerged towards the end of 2021, and pushed the government to roll out the booster vaccine programme quickly. The highly-transmissible variant swept through the UK at speed and quickly became the dominant strain. But, it was soon found to be less severe than Delta as the risk of death from Omicron 67% lower. Now new data suggests Omicron may also be less likely to cause long Covid for those adults who have been double-jabbed - but the situation changes again if you've received three jabs. What is long Covid? Long Covid is when a person who tested positive for the virus has symptoms persisting for longer than four weeks after the first initial infection, which cannot be explained by something else.  This is usually fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of smell and difficulty concentrating. It mostly occurs to people aged between 35 and 49 (particularly women) as well as those living in more depriving areas, working in social care, education or health care, with other health conditions or disabilities.  Approximately 1.8 million people in the UK are believed to be experiencing long Covid symptoms, according to data collected in the month leading up to April 3. That is a 6% increase from the previous month, and the highest number recorded so far throughout the pandemic. Around two-thirds of the people who believe they have long Covid say it has affected their day-to-day activities. So, how could the double-vaccinated be affected? According to the latest stats from the Office for National Statistics, double-vaccinated adults infected with Omicron BA.1 (the first sub-variant) were 50% less likely to report having long Covid four to eight weeks after infection. The risk of developing long Covid up to two months after an initial infection of Delta was 15.9%. This dropped to 8.7% for infections linked to Omicron's BA.1. What if you've received three Covid vaccines? The likelihood of getting long Covid changes when looking at the data for those who have been triple-jabbed. ONS found there is no change in the risk of developing long Covid between first infections with Delta and Omicron among the triple-vaccinated.  Is there a difference between the Omicron sub-variants? Yes - when it comes to the two Omicron strains, BA.1 and BA.2, the so-called 'stealth variant' the chances of developing long Covid change again. The stats suggest the odds of triple-jabbed adults reporting long Covid symptoms during that same period were 22% high with the Omicron stealth variant than BA.1. ONS has pointed out that for Omicron BA.1, around 7.8% self-reported experiencing long Covid. That compares to 9.3% with the stealth sub-variant. However, the data did not reveal what kind of long Covid risk there is for the new sub-variant, which is a combination of BA.1 and BA.2 and dubbed Omicron XE.  Experts are still learning about Covid-19. The information in this story is what was known or available at the time of publication, but guidance could change as scientists discover more about the virus.

The party is on course to lose around 300 seats in England as Labour, the Lib Dems and Greens all made gains at the Conservatives' expense. John Mallinson, the Conservative leader of Carlisle City Council, said Tory MPs should try to oust Boris Johnson after Labour picked up control of the new Cumberland authority. The Tories lost 14 seats on the council in north west England, while Labour gained 12 and took overall control. Mallinson said: 'I think it is not just partygate, there is the integrity issue. Basically I just don't feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.' Asked if he thought Conservative MPs should oust the PM, Mallinson said: 'That would be my preference, yes.' Meanwhile, Tory MP David Simmonds - whose Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner seat neighbour the PM's - said the issue of Johnson's personal conduct 'needs to be addressed'. Asked about those blaming him for the party's poor performance, the prime minister said: 'The big lesson from this is that this is a message from voters that what they want us to do above all - one, two and three - is focus on the big issues that matter to them, taking the country forward, making sure we fix the post-Covid aftershock, get us all through the economic aftershocks in the way we got through Covid, fix the energy supply issues, that's where the inflationary spike is coming, and keep going with our agenda of high wage, high skill jobs.' The Tories are also braced for a disappointing set of results in Scotland, where party figures are also blaming the PM's personal unpopularity for the decline in their fortunes. Early results indicated that the Conservatives are set to lose many councillors and slip behind Labour into third place north of the border.",

The cast of the hit Netflix reality show were brought together for a sit-down interview with Queer Eye's Tan France, following the dramatic events of the fifth season.  The reunion show dropped on Netflix on Friday, and saw Jason pressed on whether his and Chrishell's relationship was a 'showmance'.  'I hesitate to answer that question because I don't want to give any credence... it's a stupid question to me,' he said.  'I don't feel the need to explain to people,' he continued as he became emotional.  'There's a lot of sadness and loss. I think watching the show made it more difficult - it brought it back up. 'It's been a few months, but I'm still just going through stuff. I think there was a lot of love between us and there still is. I still care about her very much. This has been a very difficult break-up.' Chrishell was also seen wiping away tears as he spoke. The season five finale saw the couple - who confirmed their relationship in a post on Instagram last summer - split after Jason decided he did not want to have children.  During the reunion, Chrishell confirmed she has since moved on from Jason, revealing she is in a new relationship.  Reports earlier this week suggested she was dating non-binary rapper G Flip, which she confirmed to host Tan France.  'You don't get to choose when you meet someone in their life. Recently I met someone who is in a different place in their life as well,' she said.  'I've been spending a lot of time with someone who is very important to me, they're called G Flip, they're non-binary so they go by they/them.' Chrishell added: 'They're an extremely talented musician and it all started because I was going to be in their video.' Jason also gave the couple his best wishes, telling his ex: 'They seem like a bad ass for one and seeing [Chrishell] smile the last couple of minutes makes me very happy. I'm proud of you.'

    "733cc4b1b799894ae2cb9793fb487ff1d4984461b924dc065ca7ee5c": "It's totally normal to put on weight during a pandemic that closed gyms, made it illegal to leave your neighbourhood, and restricted us to the house.  But research shows that women have been more prone to weight gain during this time than men. That's because much of the responsibilities of the home, plus caring responsibilities, fell on women, leading many to stress-eat. With women more likely to bear the brunt of housework and homeschooling, on top of the demands of working in their professional lives, and the emotional labour of maintaining both worlds, their eating habits changed. Meanwhile, men experienced less disruption during the pandemic, despite also working from home, showed research from Leicester University. The study analysed data on 938,000 adults to analyse the changes in Britain's social habits during lockdowns. They found that women were 44% more likely to go from being a regular weight to overweight or obese, with 13% of women making the jump, while 9% of men did the same. Young adults also saw similar results, being twice as likely as their older counterparts to see their weight go up. But it any wonder that this is the case for women?  As well as the gender pay gap, women have also been financially hit during the pandemic.  According to research by the campaign group Pregnant then Screwed, almost half (46%) of working mothers made redundant believe a lack of childcare provision played a role in their redundancy. Meanwhile, 65% of mothers who were furloughed say a lack of childcare was the reason.  'There is mounting evidence showing that women have suffered huge financial penalties largely because of caring responsibilities,' Professor Dr Shumonta Quaderi, a sociologist at the London School of Economics previously told HuffPost.    'Women are losing their jobs at four times the rate of men; women especially in the lowest socioeconomic groups were more likely to be furloughed, women have been forced to cut their working hours and scale back their careers. 'So, when people say the pandemic has set back the cause of gender equality 'to the 1950s' we should all take this very, very seriously.' Healthy eating costs a lot of money, so with women earning less, in precarious work, and less likely to be in senior positions, it's not too shocking that they may opt for cheaper, more unhealthy food.   There's also gendered differences in the home. Where men might 'carry on' during lockdowns, women pick up the slack (ergo, emotional labour). Professor Thomas Yates, from Leicester University, said: 'I suspect lockdown had a differential impact on many women's lives compared to men. Men pretty much carried on as they were, they just worked from home instead. Whereas those school runs, supermarket shops or things that are potentially getting women out of the house more often suddenly stopped. 'And then you have to deal with homeschooling kids and a very different way of living, which was probably quite stressful. So not only was it reducing activity levels and changing diet, stress and mental health problems are probably playing into that as well.' All these factors has had an impact on women's mental health, which can affect body image, added Dr Yates. So it's totally normal that one might reach for comfort food. And we shouldn't feel bad for it (it's the first pandemic for most of us, after all). ",

The stunt for AGT: Extreme was supposed to see the escapologist free himself and fall underneath two cars before they collided, but the vehicles were released too early and he fell 30ft to the ground, missing the safety airbag below. Appearing on Friday's Lorraine alongside his fiancee, Sherlock star Amanda Abbington, Jonathan opened up about the accident which has left him in a wheelchair. 'I'm not down about it. I'm doing as well as I can be,' Jonathan said.  'It was pretty gnarly. It sounds very dramatic sitting here but I nearly died... I saved my life because I fell upside down, head first to the ground but I didn't hit my head.' Jonathan described the emotional moment he told Amanda following the horrific accident, that she could end their relationship. 'I did say, you have a get out of jail free card - if you want to walk away, then I completely understand and she told me not to be so stupid and that was that,' he said. Amanda added: 'We are closer and tighter than ever - every day is a joy... Life's too short - that's what I've realised through all of this. Just be in the moment. 'He's a total inspiration to me. He's an idiot - but I'm a wally so it's fine,' she joked. The couple also talked about their upcoming wedding later this year after deciding to get engaged 'within half an hour' of first meeting.  Earlier this week, Amanda detailed the extent of Jonathan's injuries. 'He fell 30 feet and lost a kidney, broke both shoulder blades, shattered both legs,' she told Jay Rayner on the Out To Lunch podcast. 'Third degree burns, broke his spine, severed his spinal cord and nearly died. And then on the operating table, he nearly died again. 'He's just been in rehab since October... He's paralysed now, he's in a wheelchair. Unless there's a kind of stem cell surgery or that thing that Elon Musk is designing with the little chip, he'll be like that [forever].' NBC promoted AGT: Extreme, an eight-episode spin-off from its highly successful America's Got Talent series, as a showcase of 'the most outrageous, unique and jaw-dropping acts of enormous scale and magnitude that simply cannot be confined to a theatre stage'.

    "5fbc4588ca47c8003eaf47d4c69b188369a892830fa22da833fa8bef": "Last Saturday, we reported that the local elections were a moment of danger as well as opportunity for Keir Starmer. The Labour leader needed to show that he was making sufficient progress to prove to his party that we was on course to lead them to victory at the next general election. With a significant chunk of the results now in, it's pretty clear that while Labour have firmly established itself as the natural party of government in London, that's certainly not the case in other parts of the country. Senior party figures were, naturally, keen to highlight the night's successes, such as the victories in true blue Westminster and Wandsworth, as well as the impressive win on the new Cumberland Council. 'It's good, solid progress, especially when you consider we were absolutely smashed in 2019,' one shadow cabinet member told HuffPost UK. 'We're set up now to go after the Tories in the seats they still hold in inner London, and we've stemmed the tide in the Red Wall. We're also hoping to be second in Scotland, which obviously isn't where we want to be, but again it's progress on where we've been in the recent past.' But others were also left underwhelmed by the party's showing in the Midlands and north of England, where they will have to make major gains to win the next election.  Indeed, polling expert Professor John Curtice pointed out that the party's support in the Red Wall areas they lost to the Tories at the last general election is actually down on 2018, when the council seats there were last contested. 'For a party that's looking to make progress ... this wasn't quite the degree of progress that they might have anticipated,' he told the BBC. So how might Starmer respond to the message sent out by the electorate last night? One senior Labour figure said: 'I suspect that the internal response will be that this shows why Labour needs to target its entire strategy even more narrowly on 45 to 65-year-old Tory-voting men in Red Wall seats.' Overall, Starmer is likely to be quietly satisfied with his night's work. But with many in the party still yet to be convinced by his election-winning qualities, it's fair to say that the jury is still out on whether he's the man to lead Labour back to government.",
    "028bd85055856bafe483d7ce2147f0bcf5d23615374fdc57f59df67f": "Amber Heard continued to describe the violence she says she endured at the hands of ex-husband Johnny Depp as she testified for a second day on Thursday, sharing her side of the incident where the Pirates Of The Caribbean star said Heard threw a glass bottle at him, severing his fingertip.  Both actors described an ugly scene of violence at a secluded rental home in Australia where Depp had been filming a movie -- but their versions of what transpired differed dramatically. Heard said multiple times that evening in March 2015 was 'terrifying,' describing it as the most scared she'd ever felt. At the height of the violence, Heard said, Depp allegedly penetrated her with a bottle repeatedly, putting pressure on her pubic bone. When he stopped, she said, she was afraid to move because she didn't know if the bottle was broken. She was bleeding, and went to the bathroom to throw up. 'I can't believe I have to do this,' she testified, while her attorney apologised for asking her to recount the alleged experience. 'Johnny had the bottle inside of me,' she said. According to Heard, the incident began after Depp started drinking and took an unknown quantity of the party drug MDMA. The pair were married at this point in their relationship -- they divorced in 2016 -- but had not seen each other in weeks due to their respective work schedules.  She said that when he shoved her, she shoved back.  'Do you want to go, little girl?' Depp asked, in Heard's telling.  Depp then allegedly began striking Heard, at one point throwing her onto a pingpong table that collapsed before starting to hit her again. At another point, Heard said she grabbed an empty bottle of alcohol Depp was waving at her tauntingly, and smashed it onto the tile floor, breaking it.  'It was like a lightbulb switch went off. He starts screaming. I don't know if he backhanded me or hit me normally, I don't really recall, but I remember it sent me down to the ground,' Heard said, crying. 'I remember by the time I picked myself off the floor, I stand up, he's got a bottle in his hand. He threw it at me. It missed, thankfully, but I kind of pulled myself back ... at some point, he had a broken bottle up against my face, neck area, by my jawline. He told me he'd carve up my face,' she testified.  'I honestly don't remember if I threw anything in his direction. I don't think I did,' Heard said. 'I just remember him having me by the nightgown. I remember him flailing me, throwing me around, I'm flailing. This was after there were some bottles broken on the floor. This was after -- again, forgive me, I wish I could remember the sequence, but it's flashes -- he's throwing these bottles at me.'  In Depp's telling, he never hit Heard or any other woman. Instead, Heard chucked a broken bottle at him inside the house in Australia, and it sliced off the tip of one finger. At one point during his dayslong testimony, Depp stood up and spread his fingers before the courtroom, displaying the one that had been repaired by doctors.  The manager of the rental house testified last month about finding Depp's fingertip in a bloody paper towel.  But Heard said she was simply trying to get away from Depp and protect herself.  'At some point, I'm up against a wall and he's screaming at me that he fucking hates me. That I ruined his life,' Heard testified. At another, she said, Depp ripped off her nightgown, leaving her naked.  After the attack, Heard said she found the house had been trashed, with empty bags of what she said was cocaine scattered around. Images shown in court showed splotches of blood on the floor, along with messages scrawled in paint and what Heard said was blood from Depp's injured finger on the walls, a couch, a lampshade and other furniture. Mashed potatoes were smeared 'all over' the walls, along with other foods, including pieces of raw steak that had been wrapped in the fragments of her nightgown, according to Heard. 'It was clear he was just out of his mind. He wrote on the back of a pillow in blood,' Heard said. 'It looked like he ran out of blood ... it wasn't bleeding enough, and he went and got paint, and it became paint and blood.'  Depp has been open about his struggles with alcohol and drug addiction in the past, but maintains that he never abused his ex-wife -- rather, he says he was the one who was abused. He said on the stand that her abuse claims were 'heinous' and 'not based in any species of truth.' Both actors' testimony came as part of Depp's defamation lawsuit against Heard over a 2018 Washington Post editorial she wrote with lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, describing her as a domestic violence survivor.  Earlier in the day, Heard built on testimony she gave on Wednesday alleging that the people who helped manage Depp's career ignored his bad behaviour and helped cover it up by, for example, changing him out of soiled clothes after he'd passed out. On Thursday, she told of an incident on a private plane in 2014 where Depp confronted her about steamy scenes she'd filmed with actor James Franco for the film The Adderall Diaries, which debuted in 2015.  'He called me a slut,' she said. Heard had described many instances throughout her testimony where Depp accused her of cheating on him with other people.  On the plane, she said that she tried distancing herself from Depp, who began 'throwing things ... ice cubes, utensils.' Then, she alleged, he slapped her in the face while a friend of the couple sat nearby. People who worked for Depp were also aboard, she said. When Heard got up, Depp kicked her in the back, causing her to fall to the floor of the plane, she said.  'No one said anything. No one did anything. You could hear a pin drop on that plane. You could feel the tension, but no one did anything,' she said.  During the incident in Australia, Heard said that after Depp's security arrived to offer help, he took out his penis and said he would write messages for her in urine. Heard recalled the security officers being amused.  In the courtroom, Depp grinned when his ex-wife mentioned him urinating.  Heard described several other scenes of violence over the course of the day, including one in which she said he punched her so hard in the face that she thought he had broken her nose. Depp had accused her of flirting with another woman, she said.  At another point, Heard said Depp had grabbed her by the hair and kicked her in the back in a hotel room during the press tour for Depp's 2015 film Mortdecai. She sobbed as she recalled checking the internet for photos of her red carpet appearance because she had brought a strapless dress to wear, and was concerned about bruises or marks showing up in the photos.  Depp and Heard were married in a civil ceremony in Los Angeles at Depp's mother's home, and then flew to the actor's private island for a party and beachside celebration with friends and family. Although he was wealthier than she was, Heard said Depp refused to entertain the notion of creating a prenuptial contract.  'He said the only way out of this was death,' she said of their marriage.  Heard is expected to resume testimony next week. ",

'I was a Northern carbohydrate monster who was morbidly obese six years ago and weighed over 18 stone,' he said in 2018. 'Si and I were warned we were morbidly obese and heading for an early grave, so our weight loss saved our lives. 'I'm 6ft, now around 15 stone and aim to drop to 14 stone.

The drama-filled interaction started on Tuesday when an Instagram user poked fun at Drake's son, Adonis, after the rapper commented about fathers who are 'elated and competitive and over supportive' of their children's pursuits. In response, the Instagram user wrote, 'Ya son prolly play with ghost writers.'  The snarky comment was in reference to past controversies where the Canadian rapper was accused of relying on ghostwriters and not drafting his own verses. Drake , who goes by @champagnepapi on the platform, decided to respond in the most Drake way: He swiftly tracked down the commenter's wife and followed her on Instagram.  'I just followed your girl cause she's prob miserable and needs some excitement in her life,' he teased.  The woman Drake followed, who goes by Toni Bowden on the social platform, shared the tea on her Instagram Story. 'Oh hey @champagnepapi,' she captioned in a screenshot of her followers, with the God's Plan rapper listed as one of them. 'My husband @ceddybo_ybagnm decides to be a troll and now @champagnepapi thinking I need excitement in my life,' she wrote, alongside laughing and eyes emojis.  But the debacle didn't end there.  Drake, who has cautioned his fans in his lyrics over the years about stealing girls away from their boyfriends and husbands, annihilated the original commenter with one final blow by sending Bowden a direct message after seeing her posts. 'I'm here for u ma,' he wrote to her. The Take Your Girl artist reunited with Future last month for several features on the March Madness rapper's ninth studio album, I Never Liked You. This week, Drake was confirmed to appear on Jack Harlow's new album Come Home the Kids Miss You, which is released today (Fri 6 May).",

HBO has unveiled an extended look at the forthcoming prequel set hundreds of years before the events of Thrones and based on author George R.R. Martin's 2018 novel, Fire & Blood. The trailer attempts to capture much of what made the flagship series so successful: Dragons roar, families squabble and dynasties almost certainly crumble in the roughly minute-long clip, which puts the ruthless House Targaryen front and centre. Sporting a set of blonder than blond wigs, King Viserys Targaryen (Paddy Considine) and his children, Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) and Prince Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith), rule over the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros before, as Thrones history tells us, a brutal civil war tears the family apart. The prequel series, however, begins with the Targaryens firmly seated on the Iron Throne, as we see glimpses of recognisable rivals Houses Stark, Velaryon, and Lannister pledging their allegiance to the family. But in the trailer, the threats appear to be a bit closer to home. The Targaryen children openly thirst for power, with a woman warning the princess, who is named as the king's heir, 'Men would sooner put the realm to the torch than see a woman ascend the Iron Throne.'  As the title promises, there are dragons galore here -- the creatures were thought to be extinct at the start of Thrones -- with Smith's character seemingly accessorising his outfits with a scaled dragon egg. The trailer concludes with one of the fire-breathers doing what it does best, as an unseen character ominously says, 'History does not remember blood. It remembers names.' Scheduled to premiere 21 Aug on HBO and HBO Max, House Of The Dragon also stars Olivia Cooke, Steve Toussaint, Eve Best, Fabien Frankel, Sonoya Mizuno and Rhys Ifans.

Conservative leader of Carlisle City Council, John Mallinson, vented his frustration after Labour picked up control of the new Cumberland authority after Thursday's round voting. The Tories lost 14 seats on the council in north west England, while Labour gained 12 and took overall control. Mallinson, who will see the council he led replaced by the new Cumberland authority, told the BBC that he had 'lost some very good colleagues' in the election, and had found it 'difficult to drag the debate back to local issues' while campaigning because of partygate and the cost-of-living crisis. Mallinson said: 'I don't think it was helping to get comments from people like George Eustice talking about people using value brands to ease their shopping bills. That just seems to have come over very patronising.' He added: 'I think it is not just partygate, there is the integrity issue. Basically I just don't feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.' Asked if he thought Conservative MPs should oust the PM, Mallinson said: 'That would be my preference, yes.' On Sky News, he said: '(Johnson) must shoulder a lot of the blame. I have been canvassing in rural areas over the last few weeks and it's been the one issue that people have brought up time and time again. Partygate, the cost of living crisis, the feel that the government were not in touch ... and sadly I have to say the prime minister cannot be relied upon to necessarily to be telling the truth.' He added: 'I think he should consider his position now.' When asked whether the areas three Tory MPs in the region should attempt to oust Johnson, he replied: 'I call upon them to do what they think is right.' Meanwhile, Johnson's Tories face losing control of a flagship London authority to Labour - but there was a mixed picture for Keir Starmer's party outside the capital. Wandsworth, which has been a Conservative authority for more than 40 years, looks set to fall to Labour, with the Tories fearing other boroughs will also be lost. But outside London, the Liberal Democrats won Hull from Labour, while the Greens also picked up seats in contests around England. Council seats are up for grabs in Scotland, Wales and many parts of England, while there are elections to Stormont in Northern Ireland. Votes were only being counted in some of the English contests overnight, including key authorities in the capital.",
    "a5300fe1e74ed2ea82a04a355e0d00a0fa61d49a78516115aec9e91a": "Thousands of votes have been counted in English council elections overnight, with results declared by 58 authorities. With hundreds more to come across the UK, here's what we know so far. Labour makes advances in London  The clearest trend of the night was the Conservative vote going down in the capital, reflecting ongoing changes in voting habits that have increasingly tilted London towards Labour. In the most significant result overnight, the flagship Tory council of Wandsworth fell to Labour. 'Boris Johnson losing Wandsworth is monumental,' a Labour source said. 'This was the Tories' jewel in the crown.'  The south London borough is renowned for its low taxes and went Tory in 1978. It's almost obligatory to refer to it as Margaret Thatcher's favourite council. Labour weren't finished there, with the Conservatives also losing Westminster - which it had held since the authority was created in 1964 - and Barnet. These are two more huge scalps for Keir Starmer. Tory fury with Boris Johnson The elections are taking place against the backdrop of the partygate scandal, a Tory MP resigning over watching porn in the Commons chamber and the squeeze on household budgets. Unsurprisingly, national issues were having an effect as dozens of Conservative councillors lost their seats across the country. Labour won the new Cumberland Council, where all three local MPs are Tory, prompting a local Conservative leader to call for the PM to go. John Mallinson, leader of Carlisle City Council, which will be replaced by the new Cumberland authority, told the BBC: 'I think it is not just partygate, there is the integrity issue. 'Basically I just don't feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.' In Portsmouth, where the Tories lost four seats, Simon Bosher the leader of the Conservative group, said Johnson should 'take a good, strong look in the mirror' because 'those are people that are actually bearing the brunt on the doorstep of behaviour of what's been going on in Westminster'. Ravi Govindia, leader of the Wandsworth Tories, said: 'Let's not be coy about it, of course national issues were part of the dilemma people were facing.' The Lib Dems and Greens make gains  It was a good night for the 'third parties'. The Liberal Democrats added to recent Westminster by-election successes in North Shropshire and Chesham and Amersham by securing victory in Hull in a straight fight with Labour for control of the authority. The Conservatives also lost control of West Oxfordshire after the Lib Dems made a series of gains. At around 6am, the Lib Dems had gained one authority and 34 more seats while the Greens had put on 19 councillors. Questions over Labour's progress nationwide The big war of spin in the next few hours is likely to be over whether Labour are making sufficient gains - particularly in the 'red wall' seats that transformed the electoral map in 2019. As well as success in Cumberland (a Labour source is quoted as saying: 'Workington man has voted Labour') and London, Labour also gained control of Southampton from the Conservatives. But Tories activists were quick to point to a lack of progress elsewhere. Labour maintained its grip on Sunderland, and slowed the shedding of seats in recent years. But is steadying the ship in its former heartlands good enough given the government's recent troubles? The Conservatives claimed the 'blue wall is building' after making gains in Nuneaton and Bedworth, which will be another disappointment for Labour. But Keir Starmer's party will be keen to point to the drubbing they took at the last general election, and the fact that the last time these specific seats were contested four years ago set a high bar to clear given Theresa May's chaotic administration.",
    "e774cb84e023df7cb7e89a8bb753d1a2a5041d5f3016fa4046570633": "Labour has taken two major scalps by winning the flagship Tory councils of Westminster and Wandsworth. The totemic victories came amid fresh calls from Conservatives for Boris Johnson to quit as party leader. In another boost for Keir Starmer, Labour gained Barrnet Council in north London from the Conservatives. Labour has also won the new Cumberland Council, where all three local MPs are Tory. Wandsworth, renowned for its low taxes, turned blue in 1978, a year before Margaret Thatcher, who considered the council her favourite, was elected prime minister. 'Boris Johnson losing Wandsworth is monumental. This was the Tories' jewel in the crown,' a Labour source said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said that 'history has been made' with the victory. Khan tweeted a photograph of himself standing beside Labour councillor Simon Hogg, the council's new leader. Alongside the photograph, Khan wrote: 'The three words we've wanted to hear for so long: WANDSWORTH LABOUR GAIN.' Westminster has been held by the Tories since its creation in 1964, and was where Johnson cast his ballot yesterday. In Barnet, the outgoing Conservative leader Daniel Thomas said: 'I think this is a warning shot from Conservative supporters and I think our loss today is not only due to the fact that I have just mentioned but also a fair number of Conservative voters who just didn't go out to vote, stayed at home.' He added: 'Clearly if Labour are to get a majority in Parliament they need to win Barnet. They won the council, if they win our parliamentary constituencies as well, then it doesn't bode well for us to form a Government in future general elections.' The Tories also lost Worcester to no overall control, with gains for the Greens and Labour. Labour also gained Southampton from the Tories, who only won control of the council last year. But there were signs Labour was struggling to make significant gains elsewhere outside the M25. Meanwhile, the Lib Dems took Kingston upon Hull from Labour and were also edging towards winning West Oxfordshire from the Tories. Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: 'This is a great night for the Liberal Democrats. We're making progress all over the country - building on our historic by-election victories last year.' The elections are set against the backdrop of the partygate scandal and a cost-of-living crisis that could turn into a recession. Council seats are also up for grabs in Scotland, Wales and many parts of England, while Northern Ireland is electing its new assembly in what could be the most significant vote of them all, with Sinn Fein seeking to become the largest party. Many of the English seats were last contested in 2018, during Theresa May's chaotic administration, meaning there may only be limited opportunities for opposition parties to make further gains.",
    "a38eb269e6db57e00319566bbd07ec2b1171c9999dd70e82fc41eb7f": "Feeling powerless is a desperate, overwhelming sensation, yet one that's very much embedded in the human experience - especially lately. Many are facing this crippling, paralysing reaction, thanks to war, the pandemic, attacks on women's rights and so many more events seemingly out of our control. This emotion can affect anyone, including the therapists who often help others work through it.  'As a therapist, a lot of people assume that I have it all together, or don't experience mental health challenges myself - which couldn't be farther from the truth,' said Rachel Wright, a licensed therapist in New York. 'Not only do I have diagnosed major depressive disorder and panic disorder, but I also have times where I feel powerless and hopeless. While I can show up for my own clients, I sometimes struggle to show up for myself.'  Below, Wright and other therapists share their go-to coping tips for when they're feeling powerless: Schedule an appointment with a therapist They practice what they preach. Wright said therapy is a core component in mental health hygiene, and she's not alone in this belief. Dr. Paul Poulakos, a board-certified psychiatrist in New York, pointed out that therapy can help in situations when you're feeling hopeless and are struggling to navigate that. 'If you are not coping with your own mental health, it makes being empathetic very difficult, as well as burnout being more probable,' Poulakos said. 'More specifically, [therapy] can assist us in reframing our circumstances and the negative thinking that often leaves us feeling hopeless or powerless.' Say no to anything that is going to add to your emotion right now Poulakos said he cannot emphasise enough how important it is to have boundaries when you're feeling hopeless. 'Learn how to say no and make sure you are doing it once in a while,' he said. 'If I ever even start to feel selfish for saying no to things, this reminds me to take inventory and question whether I'm setting boundaries.' These boundaries can be as simple as taking a few moments to yourself in the middle of the day, or taking some time off work. 'Whether it be for a day or for a month, taking a vacation does not always need to be an extreme and costly trip -- sometimes closing the laptop and unplugging is all you need,' Poulakos said. Establish your 'core four' Identify four activities that help you to feel 'grounded, connected and happy,' said Forrest Talley, a clinical psychologist based in California.  For example, yours could be cycling, interior design, fostering dogs and traveling. One of his personal tools is building something, like home projects.  Terri Cole, a licensed psychotherapist and author of Boundary Boss, said her core activities include mindful movement like yoga, baking, journaling and getting out in nature. Therapist Alfiee Breland-Noble, founder of The AAKOMA Project and host of the Couched in Color podcast, also finds that spending time in nature is therapeutic and calming, and says this is one of her first lines of attack against feelings of powerlessness. 'I set my intention on being positive, and find activities for the remainder of the day that help me maintain my peace,' she said. Find a way to burn off anxious energy 'Exercise is so helpful in blowing off steam,' said Dr. Alex Dimitriu, a double board-certified psychiatrist and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine.  Talley said intensive exercise is one of his 'constant go-to' stress relievers. 'When things even begin to feel over the top, I'll put extra intensity into my workouts,' he said. Think: heavy weight training, HIIT or judo (some of his favorites).  If that's not your thing, try some gentle movement, like walking, biking, swimming or yoga. Moving your body may help expel some of the stress that's physically building up inside. Go somewhere calming without your phone It can be easy to doomscroll into oblivion when there are events happening in the world that you have no power over. Breaks are necessary for survival. Try spending some time in a relaxing place where you don't have access to constant information. Dimitriu personally enjoys sitting in a steam room or sauna. 'These are becoming [some of] the few places you can sit without access to your phone,' he said. 'I've had some amazing insights, peaceful meditation, and mind relaxation in the quiet silence of a steam room. The heat helps, too.' Spend a few moments focusing on something that makes you feel uplifted This could be practising a skill you know you excel at, leaning into your spirituality or faith (which means something different to everyone), or reading a book or poem that speaks to you. Breland-Noble uses mantras. Simple phrases with powerful messages, these short sentences provide meaning and hope. 'Phrases like 'The cream always rises to the top,' 'Remember who you are,' 'You come from a long line of proud people who overcame tremendous odds,' and 'You are equipped with everything you need,'' are some that allow her to find footing, she said. Lean on loved ones Whether it's your partner, immediate family, best friend or a wider community, nearly every therapist recommended talking to and spending time with loved ones.  'Spending time with family is important,' said Talley, who noted that he becomes even more conscious of the need for time with his wife and children when times are particularly tough.  Find something you can do 'Personally, when I feel powerless or hopeless - usually about the state of the world as opposed to the state of my life - I focus on what I can do,' Cole said. This can include sharing resources for people, donating to organizstions that make a difference in the world, advocating for causes you care about, posting your thoughts on social media, and engaging in thoughtful conversations with others. Another thing you can do? Take care of your basic needs. 'I try to eat a little better, sleep a little better, move a little bit more, and talk with that small circle of people that help me see more clearly and accurately,' said Kevin Gilliland, a clinical psychologist based in Texas.  You do have control over something, no matter what: yourself and your actions.",
    "d564b4bd45fa34c883e242bf151d446e443708e0c7bc0ccfdabade84": "It's easy to smile at the thought of a margarita.  'It's the world's favourite cocktail, and there are good reasons why,' Jeremy Bohen, mixologist and co-founder of the canned cocktail brand QNSY, tells HuffPost. 'The ingredients are widely available and relatively inexpensive, and it doesn't require much in the way of tools or technique. Plus, the flavours are straightforward enough for the occasional imbiber, but still sophisticated enough to appeal to a connoisseur.'  For many people, this drink is all about good times. 'Margaritas are for celebrating and getting together with friends,' says Ana Martinez, assistant director of food and beverage and agave spirits expert at Hilton Los Cabos Beach & Golf Resort. Yet as much as this is a cocktail that gives off laid-back, happy vibes, it also requires attention to detail and balance. 'Creating a well-made margarita is similar to dancing the tango,' saysGabriela Abaroa, bartender at the Ritz-Carlton Sarasota. 'The flavours are the complete opposite of one another, but they also complement each other perfectly.' And, like every good drink, this one should keep you wanting more. 'A perfect margarita should hold you in a perpetual cycle of being refreshed, while causing you to become thirsty for another one,' said Maxwell Reis, beverage director at West Hollywood, California's Gracias Madre. Experts prefer rocks, not blended Our cocktail experts are firmly on team 'rocks,' with none of them preferring a blended drink. 'A truly well-constructed margarita becomes too diluted when blended with ice,' says food photographer, recipe developer and author Jackie Alpers. 'I definitely prefer rocks to frozen, because you get a better sense of the details when you don't blend it into a slush,' says Eric Trueheart, co-founder of Black Yeti Beverage. 'Don't get me wrong, the slurpee margarita is a fun drink, without a doubt. But if you want to taste something complex, interesting and delicious, rocks is the best way to go.' One easy step that too many people skip Before you even get started, pop your glassware in the freezer. 'Just one minute in a freezer will keep your cocktail as cold as when you use warmed-up plates to keep meals warm,' says Jim Wrigley, beverage manager at the Cayman Islands Kimpton Seafire Resort & Spa's Coccoloba Bar & Grill. And pay attention to your ice As you're getting ready to shake your cocktail, keep in mind that another factor separating a 'meh' at-home drink from a 'wow' mixologist-made one is the quality of the ice you're using. 'If your ice tastes like the other things in your freezer, you're in for a not-so-tasty surprise,' Reis says. 'I don't think most at-home drinkers realise how much of that ice turns into water that becomes a large portion of your drink. And if you're using flimsy ice, it will melt too quickly, and you'll wind up with a watery marg that's not cold enough.' Don't worry too much about buying fancy bar equipment, because anything can be a shaker, experts say. 'Shake it up in whatever's easiest for you - an 'official' cocktail shaker, mason jar or blender,' says Valerie Alvarado, national portfolio agave ambassador at Pernod Ricard. It won't take long, we promise: 'Shake it five to 10 seconds, depending on how vigorous you want to be,' says Lime Fresh Mexican Grill's beverage director, Ethan Albrecht-Carrie. And then, as fun as it is to act like Tom Cruise in 'Cocktail,' stop. 'Don't overshake the cocktail, or you'll water it down,' says Anthony Aviles, director of operations at the Ritz-Carlton Sarasota. Get the right tequila The good news is that the alcohol you use in margaritas doesn't need to be an over-the-top brand. 'Choose a quality silver tequila, but don't go crazy on price,' Bohen says. 'Aged tequila is great to sip on its own, but in my opinion, it's out of place in a margarita.' As you're shopping, be sure to read labels carefully. 'Tequila should be 100% agave,' Abaroa says. He's a fan of blanco tequila, noting its 'definitive, clean flavour.' The presence of agave in tequila is key, the experts say. 'Any tequila that doesn't say '100% agave' is usually mixed in with other materials like syrups and extracts, so stay away from those,' says Xyza Dapal, food and beverage operations manager at Philadelphia's Sabroso + Sorbo in The Notary Hotel. While you're reading labels, take note of where the bottle was produced. 'Tequilas from the Los Altos region, with oven-baked agaves, really bring the citrus, fruit and roasted agave flavour,' Alvarado says. Add only the best ingredients Since it has just a few ingredients, you don't need to cut corners with pre-made mixers. Those bright yellow and orange concoctions, Aviles says, are akin to 'tempting the ulcer gods and dancing with diabetes.' Sweetener: Most recipes call for agave or simple syrup, and preferences varied among our experts. 'Use good organic agave nectar,' Albrecht-Carrie says. 'I prefer a light amber, because darker agave nectars tend to overpower and need to be diluted.' On the other hand, you've probably got what you need in your pantry to whip up simple syrup, if you'd rather use that. 'I know some people like to use agave in margaritas, and there's some poetry there, but I much prefer simple syrup,' Bohen says. 'It really is simple to make. Use equal parts water and sugar, warmed just enough to dissolve the sugar.' Fresh juice: 'I truly believe that without fresh lime juice, margaritas lack the tartness and acid that can only be attained from limes,' said cocktail influencer Carlos Ruiz. That fresh juice, it turns out, brings more to your drink than just its liquid. 'Hand-juicing the limes will introduce the delicate oils which come from the peel,' says Stuart Yurczyk, co-founder, vice president and general manager at Mixly Cocktail Co. 'Citrus oils have a fantastic aroma and add depth to your cocktails.' Once you've mastered the art of juicing limes, you may want to experiment with flavors by tossing in other fresh ingredients. 'Adding freshly cut jalapeno, mango, strawberry, avocado or even cilantro will elevate your margarita,' Alvarado says. Salt: Whether you're a salted-rim lover or hater, you can find a mixologist who shares your views. On the 'pro' side, Wrigley is a believer. 'Good salt is essential,' he says. 'We use Maldon salt for the classics and homemade spicy salt, using local peppers, for our Spicy Margarita. Another fantastic element is Gusano salt, a Mexican salt using the 'worm,' a grub that feeds on ripe agaves. And we house-smoke salt, using local logwood, for our Mezcal Margaritas.' But not everyone is pro-salt. According to Carlos Kronen, founder and executive director of The Bartender Company, a mobile bartending service, it's not a good idea. 'Salt kills your palate, so a salted rim is only recommended when using low-end tequila,' he says. Somewhere in the middle of the salt debate is Alicia Perry, general manager at San Diego's Polite Provisions. 'When it comes to a salt rim, I always ask about the customer's preference, because salt isn't for everyone,' she says. 'I personally prefer a partial salt rim, so I have a choice with each sip.' Garnishes: Use fresh citrus twists or wedges, fresh peppers or anything else you like. Perhaps try checking out local ingredients to make a margarita truly 'yours.' Alpers mentions a unique garnish she enjoyed at Tucson's El Crisol mezcal bar. 'It was finished with a dried lime slice and creosote leaves,' she said. 'Those leaves come from a bush native to Tucson that releases a sweet smell whenever it rains - or when it's floating on top of a drink. It was a perfect expression of the Tucson desert in every way.' Spicy touches: Once you've mastered the basics, you might want to incorporate other elements, like heat. 'I remember the first time I had a spicy margarita, and it changed my entire understanding of what a margarita can be,' Yurczyk says. 'I'm a Midwest native, so it didn't take long for sweat to begin beading up around my nose and cheekbones, but I was addicted. I hadn't realised it until that moment, but the tequila's smoothness, lime juice's acidity and orange liqueur's sweetness were practically begging for the addition of spice.' 'I was on my honeymoon a looong time ago in Puerto Vallarta and was served a pineapple chile margarita,' says Dora Stone, founder of the vegan Mexican recipe blog Dora's Table. She remains a fan of margarita heat, and her blog includes a popular recipe for a Spicy Hibiscus Ice Margarita. Another tip from Stone: 'Add candied jalapenos or chile powder on the rim, like the ever-so-popular mango chamoy margarita.'",

Oh, and FYI -- prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication. It's easy to assume acne is just a teen thing. You don't expect that in your mid twenties your skin will, almost overnight, breakout in painful spots. But adult acne is actually super common.  The British Association of Dermatologists reported that 19% of adults aged 25 and over have reported experiencing some form of adult acne, with causes ranging from hormonal imbalances and stress to pollution and clogged pores. And it can be highly stressful if it happens to you.  I say this because I know. All through my teens I had pretty perfect skin (minus the odd party-pooping zit). I felt blessed by the skin gods. But in my early twenties, I noticed I was breaking out with lots of teeny tiny spots, primarily across my t-zone. My skin was painful, red and super sore.  Adult acne was completely new to me, and like any newbie, I tried product after product, each of which promised miracle results, but failed to deliver.  In fact, they often seemed to be making my skin worse. I didn't know it at the time, but acne can actually be exacerbated by using the wrong products for your skin type, and not having a proper targeted skincare routine. Whoops.  I was starting to feel I'd never have blemish free skin again. Then, a friend recommended that I try Nip+Fab's Teen Skin Fix range and, honestly, it's the one. While there's nothing wrong with blemishes (after all, we all get them), if you're finding it hard living with adult acne and the pain and soreness it brings, these are the products I swear by and have used religiously for five years. They might be designed with teens in mind, but don't be put off by the packaging - they're a total game-changer for adult acne, too - both targeting and future-proofing against the blemishes that can blight your skin. The range - face-wash, pads, roller-ball and moisturiser - combines a potent dose of salicylic acid with wasabi extract and tea tree oil, which penetrate deep into your pores to remove impurities and stop breakouts at the source.  If that sounds like blurb, what matters, of course, is results - and I've got them. Even for super sensitive skin like mine, the products didn't cause any issues. My skin now looks and feels much healthier, and my acne is finally under control.",

    "0bf8d07556aa89273e18a2be3fa38b969bdf737b14d473c93aa23ab0": "The Bank of England has issued a stark warning to British people that the economy is at risk of slipping into a recession as it raised interest rates to 1%. The central bank's hike - by a quarter of a percentage point - means the base rate is at a level last seen in 2009. The move is designed to curb the soaring cost of goods and services - known as inflation - which could go above above 10%, which would be a 40-year high. While effectively putting the brakes on spells bad news for people borrowing money, with mortgage holders likely to feel the immediate impact, it was largely predicted - and could be followed by more increases. The biggest shock came in the warning of a recession - a word that sends alarm bells ringing for many - as the Ukraine war compounds a crippling cost-of-living crisis. What is a recession?  A technical recession is defined by two successive quarters of falling economic output - measured by gross domestic product (GDP), which attempts to summarise all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy in a single figure. Some people argue the term 'recession' is an unreliable indicator because people could be suffering all the effects of an economic downturn, such as long-term unemployment, but the data might not be officially say as much. For instance, a 'double-dip recession' is when a recession is followed by a short-lived recovery and another recession, but people's lives do not feel much different throughout that period. Recessions ultimately have an impact on living standards, but the full effect largely depends on the scale of unemployment and how long it takes for businesses and the jobs market to recover. What's the outlook? On Thursday, the Bank predicted that growth will contract in the final three months of 2022 as the cost squeeze sees households rein in their spending. The UK is set to narrowly miss a technical recession, but the Bank forecast 'very weak' quarterly growth in 2023 and a contraction as a whole next year. They predict GDP will fall by 0.25% and unemployment will pick up sharply. 'It is a very weak projection, a very sharp slowdown,' Bank governor Andrew Bailey told reporters. 'There's a technical definition of a recession it doesn't meet - but put that to one side - it is a very sharp slowdown in activity.' When was the last recession? Not that long ago. In 2020, the Office for National Statistics officially declared the UK in recession - the steepest on record - after the economy plunged by 19.6% between April and June due to the coronavirus lockdown. It followed a 2.2% contraction in the previous three months - marking the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis, when the UK fell into a year-long recession. But this was followed by growth of 17.4% in the third quarter of 2020 - underlining how the economy was lurching from one extreme to another during the early stages of the pandemic.  What is fuelling a potential recession? The world is being buffeted by a unique set of circumstances. Inflation is surging as a result of the easing of the pandemic. It means the costs of goods and services have become more expensive because of a number of factors - such as the scarcity of workers unwilling to do jobs they previously had, and pent-up demand from consumers. Economists believed this was a big problem as the cost of life's expenses was growing faster than people's wages, but that would only be temporary. Then Russia invaded Ukraine, which sent energy prices spiraling given the world's reliance and oil and gas from the region. The Bank has said it was also worried about the impact of renewed Covid-19 lockdowns in China which threaten to hit supply chains again and add to inflation pressures. What is 'stagflation'?  Economists think the Bank is walking a tightrope to avoid an economic 'perfect storm' called stagflation - a contradictory situation where costs are rising but fewer people are in work. The worst of all worlds. Raising interest rates might help to combat inflation, but that could mean the economy stalls. Using interest rates could be a particularly blunt instrument when the inflationary pressures are coming from overseas with higher energy costs. The risk is this: more nudges by way of further interest rate hikes could be the catalyst for a full-blown recession.",

The prime minister's sit-down with the ITV breakfast show made headlines for a number of reasons earlier this week, one of which came after Susanna introduced Lorraine, who hosts the show directly after GMB. 'Who's Lorraine?' Johnson asked. 'Who's Lorraine? Lorraine is a legend,' Susanna replied. The moment soon went viral - and even drew a response from former GMB host Piers Morgan - with Lorraine now having her say on the matter.  Speaking on the Be Honest podcast, she said: '[It] was brilliant, and brilliant because she let him speak. She wasn't trying to point score. She was just trying to get to the heart of the matter. 'And it wasn't kind of two alpha males. It was a forensic, really intelligent interview. She absolutely did her homework and he was on the ropes, because he's broad strokes, he's not attention to detail.' Co-host Bruce Devlin asked Lorraine: 'You say Boris doesn't have attention to detail, how on earth does he not know who you are?' She replied: 'I don't expect him to.' Asked if Boris Johnson knows who Lorraine is, the PM's spokesperson previously told HuffPost UK: 'I think as was clear the prime minister was not fully across the ITV daytime lineup this morning. He has a number of issues to deal with.' Piers Morgan said it was 'over' for Johnson after his apparent knowledge gap.  Trailing his TalkTV show Piers Morgan Uncensored in a chat with the channel's Tom Newton-Dunn, Piers said: 'We all know Lorraine Kelly. I think he knows Lorraine Kelly, he just didn't know what on earth was going on in that whole interview.' He continued: 'I thought Susanna skewered him beautifully and he just lost his way and lost his mind, as he does so often. 'The trouble is he can probably survive partygate to a degree, maybe even survive surging inflation. He can't survive insulting Lorraine Kelly - it's over. It's over for him.' The Lorraine Kelly episode of Be Honest, which is hosted by comedians Jojo Sutherland and Bruce Devlin, is available on Monday online.",

The Call Me By Your Name actor was due to tread the boards in an adaptation of the critically acclaimed play 4,000 Miles at The Old Vic.  The production, which was also set to star Dame Eileen Atkins, was originally scheduled to open in London in April 2020 but was postponed when theatres across the country had to close their doors due to the pandemic.  However, The Old Vic has now confirmed the show will not be going ahead after it proved 'impossible' to reschedule.  A statement said: 'Following the postponement of 4000 Miles due to the pandemic, and despite an enormous amount of effort from all involved, we have now sadly and reluctantly concluded that we are unable to reschedule the production at a time possible for everyone involved. 'After two years of trying hard to make it work, it has proved impossible. 'We're sorry not to have better news, and we want to thank our audiences for their continued patience and understanding.' Timothee was due to star as 21-year-old Leo, who, after suffering a major loss during a summer bike riding trip, seeks solace in the New York home of his 91-year-old grandmother, Vera.  Thursday's announcement was met with disappointment from Timothee's fans on social media... The actor is one of Hollywood's most sought-after young actors having recently starred in 2021's Dune and 2019's Little Women. He will next be seen on screen in coming-of-age romance horror Bones & All later this year, and recently filmed his role as Willy Wonka in the Charlie & The Chocolate Factory prequel Wonka, which is due for release next year.

The term upskirting refers to someone taking photographs underneath another person's clothing, without their consent. The Countdown host recalled how the star - who she did not name - put his phone under her skirt while she was playing table tennis with her husband, former Strictly Come Dancing professional Pasha Kovalev.  Speaking on the Dirty Mother Pukka podcast, Rachel said: 'He just got an Apple Watch, and at a party at a friend's house, I was playing table tennis with Pash, and this guy, in full view of everyone, came, put his phone on the floor under my skirt where I was playing table tennis, and went and sat back down a couple of metres away while him and all his mates looked at his watch. 'It was like a video basically. So he went and put his phone down so he could look up and went two metres away to go and look at his phone, look up my skirt.' Rachel said she had been 'too polite' at the time, adding: 'Now, being able to digest it and think about it, if someone tried to do that to me again I would break their phone. 'If they've got a problem with that, they can go to the police and we can deal with it in the public. 'That a man obviously thought he could get away with blatantly, brazenly putting his phone, upskirting me on a video for his friends on his phone, and it would be fine! 'Now I would just break his phone and deal with it afterwards,' she said.  'I think the days of being polite, meek and mild, to someone who wants to grab you, nah, done with that.' During the interview, Rachel also reiterated her calls for social media bosses to do more to protect women on their platforms, as she spoke of how she had been sent unsolicited sexual content online. She also discusses the trolling she has experienced, revealing that after speaking publicly on a podcast about it she faced a stream of abuse during her birthday week which left her in tears. She said: 'Early doors, I had no idea how to deal with it. I took everyone at face value and tried to use education and be reasonable and explain and engage. 'At one stage I spoke publicly on a podcast, and it was like a tap had been turned on. Literally, it felt like someone's pressed a button and sent them all in my direction all at once.' The TV star admitted the trolling was 'overwhelming' and led to one of the only times she has argued with Kovalev as he was frustrated to see the 'horrible people' getting to her.

    "7fa780b4aa1996f7a9a0396f4f29bc65b1c49f61f1034879e4d18143": "Leaked documents caused an international uproar on Monday night, as they suggested the Supreme Court plans to remove the national law protecting the right to have an abortion in the US. The landmark ruling, known as the Roe vs Wade case, was first established in 1973 and legalised abortion for the whole country. If the Supreme Court does strike this ruling down, America's reproductive rights will be taken back to the 20th Century. Here's everything you need to know. What is Roe v Wade? The ruling guarantees the federal constitutional protection of abortion rights. This means states could not ban abortion. So, since 1973, all women in the US have enjoyed the absolute right to an abortion in the first three months of their pregnancy. Abortion is partially permitted in the second trimester too, up to the point when the fetus could survive outside the womb - this is usually between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. Why is it in the news now? POLITICO obtained a leaked an initial draft majority opinion - labelled '1st Draft' - from the US Supreme Court on Monday night about Roe v Wade. If the document is accurate, it suggests Justice Samuel Alito wants to pull apart the federal constitutional protection of abortion rights, and that he has the majority backing from his peers on the US Supreme Court. This means 36 million people women could lose abortion access, according to Planned Parenthood organisation. In the document, Alito wrote: 'Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. 'And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe [has] enflamed debate and deepened division.' He claimed that the 'Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision', adding: 'It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.' According to POLITICO, four of the other Republican-appointed justices voted with Alito back in December when Mississippi first called for the case to be overturned and for abortions to be banned after just 15 weeks. This means five out of the nine justices in the Supreme Court supposedly back removing Roe v Wade now. What could the ruling mean? Abortion could become illegal in 22 states if the landmark case is dropped, as individual states could regulate the laws around abortion instead. There are already 13 states which have passed 'trigger laws' - meaning they would automatically ban abortion if the law is overruled in the coming months - while other states are expected to act only once Roe v Wade has definitely been dropped. It would not necessarily become illegal in all states. As California governor Gavin Newsom tweeted: 'We can't trust [the Supreme Court] to protect the right to abortion so we'll do it ourselves.' However, there's no doubt that it would have a substantial impact on the attitude towards abortion rights in the US, and beyond. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, said in a joint statement with fellow leading Democrat Chuck Schumer that if accurate, the court was 'poised to inflict the greatest restriction of rights in the past 50 years'. Protests have already begun The leak triggered passionate demonstrations from pro-choice activists on Tuesday, as crowds called on the Democrats in Congress to protect abortion rights. There are concerns that abortions will still happen, even if Roe vs Wade is overturned, but they will not be legal - and so will be unsafe.  While it would be possible for people to travel to states where abortions are still legal, not everyone can afford such a trip, meaning the ruling would affect the poor the most. Taking away the autonomy for people to decide what happens to their bodies is yet another pressing concern, while such a ruling from the Supreme Court may embolden anti-abortion activists all over the world, too. This wasn't out of the blue The clamour against reproductive rights in the US has been growing in the last few years. It really began to pick up pace when Donald Trump appointed three right-leaning people to the Supreme Court during his time in the White Office, making it more conservative than it has been in its entire history. Calls to restrict abortion in Republican states, most recently Oklahoma, have simultaneously been mounting. In 2021 alone, close to 600 abortion restrictions were brought in across the country. Of these, 90 were enacted into law. According to the BBC, that 'is more than in any year' since the Roe ruling. However, just because it was clear this was where the legislation was heading doesn't make it any less shocking. Here's a round-up of how some UK-based commentators feel about the leak: What will happen next? It is not apparent if the document represents the final opinion and justices have changed their minds in the past. The Supreme Court justices are expected to make a decision in late June or early July around the case.  Six of the nine justices who currently sit on the Supreme Court were appointed by Republican presidents. The court only needs a majority to come to a decision. At the moment, five of the Republican appointed justices have backed the move to remove Roe vs Wade, while the three Democrat-appointed are opposing it. Only Republican-appointed Chief Justice John Roberts' vote is unclear at the moment. The Supreme Court and the White House have not yet commented. The leak itself is also alarming, because the Supreme Court is the most secretive of Washington's establishments and so trust among justices - and staff - may now be significantly weakened. How could this impact the UK? No.10 has already slapped down any claims that it will reconsider abortion rights here in the UK.  On Tuesday, prime minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson said the decision was 'a matter for the US courts', but added: 'The UK fully supports women's reproductive rights globally and including the right to access safe and legal abortion.' However, there are usually concerns that the similarities between UK and US culture mean they can influence each other more than people realise.  As leader of the Women's Equality Party Mandu Reid told HuffPost UK, the news is 'chilling'.  She continued: 'It is an outright assault on the rights of American women, threatening to deny 50% of the population their bodily autonomy. 'It has ominous consequences for women everywhere and is a reflection of the global backlash against reproductive rights.' Reid also pointed out: 'Make no mistake, abortion access is not watertight in the UK, and has been under threat for years, as we've seen with recent threats to at-home abortions, the requirement for two doctors to sign off on an abortion, and the fact that it is still not a legal right.'

Boris Johnson's former adviser-turned-nemesis reiterated his call for a 'regime change', blaming the government for 'more taxes, s*** bureaucracy and the chance of nuclear war'. In his characteristic colourful language, Cummings told his 274,000 followers it was now 'irrational' to 'prop up' Johnson -- whom he referred to with a clown emoji -- now that Brexit had been achieved. 'Remain/brexit/left/right/political/official, all shd unite in removing pointless f***h***,' he wrote.

The Home Office caused outrage when it announced its plan to relocate anyone who arrived by so-called illegal means to the UK - particularly via the English Channel - to the east African country of Rwanda. These asylum seekers would then be inadmissible to the UK under new immigration rules, even once they were processed there. The new proposal has not yet been approved and Downing Street has admitted it will not come into effect for several 'months' - and it blamed this delay on all the legal challenges to the programme. Speaking to the media from Southampton Airport on Wednesday, the prime minister explained the government had always been aware there would be legal challenge to the programme. He explained: 'Of course, there are going to be legal eagles, liberal lawyers, who will try to make this difficult to settle. 'We always knew this was going to happen, but it is a very, very sensible thing. 'If people are coming across the Channel illegally, and if they are, their lives are being put at risk by ruthless and unscrupulous gangsters, which is what is happening at the moment.' Johnson just said that a solution was needed to push back 'those gangsters' behind the trafficking of people across the English Channel. 'I think that's a humane, compassionate and sensible thing to do,' he added. 'I'm not going to pretend to you that is going to be without legal challenges. I think I said that when I announced it, but we will get it done.' But the prime minister's acknowledgement of these 'legal challenges' only seemed to encourage his critics to ask why the policy was not legally sound in the first place. So what are the legal challenges? The prime minister's spokesperson initially promised that flights to Rwanda would happen 'at the earlier opportunity' and that the plan was 'fully legally secure approach that has been tested and thought through'. But, he added: 'We have received pre-action correspondence from a number of legal firms, I can't get into that more... but we still maintain our hope to have the first flights take place in a matter of months.' According to PA news agency, the president of the Law Society of England and Wales - Stephanie Boyce - is also particularly wary of the scheme. 'The PM appears to have little confidence the plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda is legal if he is even at this early stage preparing for it to be challenged in the courts,' she explained. 'It is not clear that the Nationality and Borders Act gives the government the powers to do this. 'There are questions as to whether this scheme would comply with the Refugee Convention, whether refugees threatened with being sent to Rwanda would be able to access justice if they are mistreated.' Heavily criticised by Labour as a sign of the 'complete chaos' in Downing Street, the proposal has also come under fire by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York on 'moral and ethical grounds'.",

    "f548eb504fcba9893fc04b45434400d8edc9f300fee415bcf3376708": "Deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have increased for the sixth week in a row in England and Wales, even though infection rates have been dropping. The Office for National Statistics reported that there were 1,042 cases in the week leading up to April 22 where Covid was listed on the death certificate. This is a 4% increase compared to the previous seven days, and sadly the highest death rate recorded since February 11. This isn't also even the full picture - there's an expected delay in the data due to the long bank holiday weekend, Good Friday on April 15 and the bank holiday the following Monday. The national break meant fewer deaths were registered across the country. However, this is still far below the death toll recorded during March 2020 when the first wave of infection reached the UK long before vaccines became widely available.  January 2021 saw a staggering number of deaths too, as 8,433 were registered in one week. Rates were also higher in January this year, when the Omicron variant broke through to the general public. At its peak, that wave triggered 1,484 weekly deaths. Approximately 194,868 deaths in the UK had Covid mentioned on the death certificate - and nine out of 10 had the virus listed as the primary cause.  Why's this happening now? While the UK is operating under Downing Street's 'Living with Covid' strategy - meaning all restrictions have been lifted - Infection rates are also falling. Still, the prevalence of Covid within society is still very high. A study from March found Covid levels had reached their highest levels, with around one in 16 people in England having the virus. According to Imperial College React's study, most of these cases were caused by the Omicron stealth variant, BA.2. While this rate of infection has clearly levelled off since scientists did predict in April that - as these positive rates were mainly occurring in children and younger adults - the wave was about to move into the older generations. When it reached people aged over 55, there's a higher rate of severe infection and possible hospitalisation. Professor Paul Elliott, director of the React programme and chairman in epidemiology at Imperial College London, warned that older age groups would be affected as their vaccine immunity would wane earlier. He told the BBC: 'We also know many older people had their booster way back in October or November last year so it's likely there will be some waning of the vaccine against infection, if not hospitalisation.' The number of tests being conducted is also falling, according to the government's Covid dashboard. This is unsurprising now that lateral flow tests are no longer free and are not essential for entry into various venues, as they were under the government's Plan B.",

VB's former bandmate Mel B has revealed that the future king enquired about the possibility of all five Spice Girls regrouping when she collected her MBE on Wednesday. Recalling her brief conversation with William, Mel revealed: 'William told me, 'I'm so delighted that it's me giving you this'. And he asked, 'Will you get the Spice Girls back together?'.  'I told him I was having dinner with Victoria that evening and he said, 'Oh good, I'll work on David then'.'  If the future king can't make this happen then, quite frankly, who the heck can?

The hit BBC thriller came to a controversial conclusion last month, with fans and critics calling it out as 'lazy' and 'unoriginal'. The show wrapped up with main characters Eve and Villanelle finally getting it together, before the deadly assassin was shot on the orders of Carolyn Martens and bled to death after jumping into the Thames with Eve. Speaking to Deadline, Sandra, who played Eve, revealed that it was originally conceived that it was her character who would perish in the show's conclusion.  'Honestly, it was going to be the other way around,' she said. 'When I was talking to Laura Neal, our head writer - that was at the beginning of 2020 - and we were chatting about how we were going to end this. I was like, 'You should kill my character'. I thought that would be the strongest and the most interesting ending. 'And not only that, I felt emotionally, it was the right place of where I was at, because at the end of season three, I just felt like Eve was starting to get into kind of like a nihilistic place, and we're like, 'Let's just continue that line and let's go straight into it''. Sandra explained that Covid - which caused numerous delays to the fourth series - meant things changed.  She continued: 'The pandemic happened, and then somewhere in the summertime, they came to me and said, 'We can't do it. We need to change it. Eve needs to live'. 'Eve is the way into this world, she's our everywoman, so it's kind of really super depressing if she dies. So we switched it around and Jodie was very much on board with that.' It was heavily criticised by fans and critics, who noted that the decision to kill a queer character played into the 'bury your gays' trope present in many works of fiction, whereby more queer characters - and in particular lesbian, bisexual female and transgender characters - die compared to their straight cisgender counterparts. Luke Jennings - who penned the Codename Villanelle novels on which Killing Eve was based - later hit out at the ending in a piece for the Guardian. He wrote: 'The season four ending was a bowing to convention. A punishing of Villanelle and Eve for the bloody, erotically impelled chaos they have caused. A truly subversive storyline would have defied the trope which sees same-sex lovers in TV dramas permitted only the most fleeting of relationships before one of them is killed off. 'How much more darkly satisfying, and true to Killing Eve's original spirit, for the couple to walk off into the sunset together? Spoiler alert, but that's how it seemed to me when writing the books.' One of Killing Eve's writers Kayleigh Llewellyn also revealed the show was not originally due to finish with its fourth season.  All seasons of Killing Eve are available to stream now on BBC iPlayer.  ",
    "fd96e7c410fe43dfda1e454c40f8b945b5e8ff7f92b650af37d85f07": "Shell revealed on Thursday it tripled its profits over the last year, with the oil giant raking in PS7.2bn. Earlier this week BP reported profits of PS5bn the first three months of the year, its highest quarterly earnings in more than a decade. The company admitted it had 'more cash than we know what to do with'. Meanwhile voters are struggling with steep rises in energy bills, with Boris Johnson being confronted with stories of pensioners riding the bus all day just to keep warm. Labour has demanded the government impose a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in order to help people pay cope with the increase costs. But the prime minister has repeatedly rejected the suggestion. What is a windfall tax? A windfall tax is a one-off tax on a company or group of companies. It is so named as it targets excess profits the firms had not expected to make or were responsible for. In this case, oil and gas companies are raking in extra cash as a result of high energy prices in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. What does Labour say? Labour has proposed imposing a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers. Keir Starmer has said an extra 10 per cent should be added to their corporation tax bill for one year. Corporation tax is a tax companies have to pay the government on their profits. Labour has said the move would raise PS1.2bn, with the money used to save people PS600 on their bills. Starmer has made it the centre piece of his local election campaign, saying: 'The thing that has been keeping people up at night is worrying about paying their bills.'  What does the government say?  Boris Johnson has rebuffed calls from Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP for the tax. The prime minister has argued increasing taxes would 'stop investment' by oil and gas firms in the UK, especially in new green power that is needed to help wean the UK off Russian energy.  'We haven't invested enough in our own domestic energy and we need these big energy companies to step up to the plate and put their money into sustainable solutions, more green energy and to help keep costs down,' he told ITV this week.   'That is a much, much better solution than clobbering them and dissuading them, stopping them from making that investment.' There does however appear to be something of a cabinet split. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has hinted he is open to the idea. He told Mumsnet recently that a windfall tax was 'of course' something he would 'look at' if investments were not being made by firms. 'Nothing is ever off the table in these things,' he added.   But what do the oil firms say? Johnson's claim energy firms did 'not want' a windfall tax has also been undermined by none other than Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP. He told The Times that a windfall tax would not stop any projects they currently have planned. 'There are none that we wouldn't do,' he said.",
    "dcc71031672e26e5272fe1c8eee02cd4571d920a6f78fdefcfc6c9df": "Anyone who has taken the tube in central London lately might be forgiven for thinking that Bridgerton star Jonathan Bailey was starring in a production of 'A Seriously Hot Ticket'. He's not, of course. He's actually been treading the boards in a production of Cock, but the title of the play has been removed from all ads on the London Underground, which kinda defeats the object of advertising the play if people don't actually know what it's called. Instead, the poster features Jonathan's name as well as that of his former co-star, Taron Egerton (who, to confuse matters further, withdrew from the production in April), alongside a photo of them both and a snippet of The Times review that reads 'A Seriously Hot Ticket'. The show's actual title has been censored by Transport for London (TFL), Variety reports. A TFL spokesperson told the US outlet: 'All advertising running on across the [TFL] estate needs to comply with both our own advertising policy and the Advertising Standards Authority's codes and rulings. Following advice from the Committee of Advertising Practice, the campaign was amended to ensure it was compliant.' The decision has been slammed by Cock producer Chris Harper, who said he was 'absolutely astounded' by the decision. 'It is 2022!' he said in a statement shared with Variety.  'The word is perfectly acceptable and has many meanings. Mike Bartlett's hilarious play, which is currently playing at the Ambassadors Theatre where the title is proudly displayed on the theatre, is a beautifully written piece which was inspired by a cockfight.' According to TFL's advertising policy, an ad will be deemed unacceptable if 'it is likely to cause widespread or serious offence to reasonable members of the public on account of the product or service being advertised, the content or design of the advertisement, or by way of implication,' and/or 'it could reasonably be seen as distasteful, indecent or obscene, in its use of imagery, language or otherwise.' Rocketman star Taron withdrew from his role in the play due to 'personal reasons' last month. The 32-year-old had been beset by difficulties since starting the run in March after fainting during the opening night and then later testing positive for Covid-19. He has since been replaced by his understudy Joel Harper-Jackson for the remainder of the run until 4 June.",
    "1b1519fcee6630bbe63280ada352c25a7d7cb9cc2afda217a6fb4fa7": "Russia is set to celebrate its national holiday Victory Day on Monday, and the West is worried that Vladimir Putin might use the occasion to declare all-out war. More than two months since the invasion of Ukraine, it's pretty clear that the Russian president's planned offensive has not gone entirely to plan.  The strength of the Ukrainian resistance has repeatedly stunned Russian forces, leaving them lacking morale and even functioning equipment. Meanwhile, the country's international reputation is in tatters as the war crime allegations mount. However, Putin has only increased his aggressive rhetoric and evidently has no intention to back down, even in the face of defeat. Now the highly symbolic Russian holiday Victory Day is just around the corner, is the Russian president about to take the barbaric war up a notch? What is Victory Day? Monday, May 9, will be the 77th anniversary of the Soviet Army's victory over the Nazis in 1945. It is always honoured as a national holiday and with a military parade through Moscow, while other celebrations take place across the country.  The director of the Russia-Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, James Nixey, told CNN: 'May 9 is designed to show off to the home crowd, to intimidate the opposition and to please the dictator of the time.' Warplanes have already been seen practising flying over Moscow's Red Square in the shape of the letter 'Z' - the pro-invasion symbol which has swept through Russia is recent weeks. The Kremlin is also allegedly trying to make the conquered Ukrainian city of Mariupol - which has been completely destroyed by Russian shelling - the 'centre of the celebrations', according to the Ukrainian defence intelligence agency. So why would Putin accelerate his plans on Monday? Victory Day is a very symbolic day in Russia, so it would make sense for the Russian president to choose this occasion to step up his acts of aggression. Putin has previously used the holiday to mobilise the nation for new battles and even laid the groundwork for tackling 'the ideology of the Nazis' last year. Russian state media has also suggested that the attacks on Ukraine are a continuation of the country's mission from World War 2, as Putin has falsely but repeatedly claimed that Nazis lead Ukraine. Defence secretary Ben Wallace warned last week that the Kremlin would see the national holiday as an excuse to champion greater violence against Ukraine. He told LBC Radio:'I would not be surprised [...] that he is probably going to declare on this May Day that 'we are now at war with the world's Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people'.' Wallace pointed out that Putin has 'failed in nearly all objectives' of the war, so 'may seek to consolidate what he's got' with a more aggressive declaration. However, Wallace did warn that he had no intelligence suggesting such an announcement was on the horizon, but said that was an educated guess based on Putin's previous comments. Russia is also on the cusp of being hit with an oil embargo from the EU, and is struggling under the weight of other Western sanctions - meaning he is likely to be looking for a quick win to unite the public under him. What might happen? So far, Putin has described the invasion of Ukraine as a 'special military operation', but he might use Victory Day to expand the scope of his aggression by declaring war on Nato for helping Ukraine. As Wallace pointed out: 'We have seen a number of statements from Putin about this becoming a war - 'this is a proxy war' - which it isn't - and 'Nazis are everywhere', basically, they are not just in Ukraine.' He continued: 'I think he will try to move from his 'special operation'. He's been rolling the pitch, laying the ground for being able to say, 'look this is now a war against Nazis and what I need is more people. I need more Russian cannon fodder'.' Wallace did point out though that he was not at all 'rattled' by Putin's threats towards Nato. A Kremlin spokesperson also said on Wednesday that there was 'no chance' he would declare war on the special occasion. However, Russia also continues to deny that it is at war with Ukraine. It also refused to admit it planned to invade its European neighbour right up until its troops crossed the country's borders on February 24. Alternatively, Putin could renew his vicious attacks on Ukraine and enact Russia's mobilisation law on Monday. This means the Kremlin may assemble more troops to help make up for the 15,000 troops lost through extending conscription, and calling in reservists. Martial law would then be announced to consolidate Putin's power at the helm of the country while men of fighting age would be prevented from leaving Russia. However, this is unlikely to be popular with the general public, and actually backfire, meaning Putin lost support for his attack on Ukraine. He could also put the country's economy on a war footing through full-scale mobilisation, or seek to consolidate Russia's few successes. To do this, he may annexe the breakaway Ukrainian territories of Lunhansk and Donetsk, push for the city of Odesa or declare full control over Mariupol. US State Department spokesman Ned Price said this week that there is 'good reason to believe that the Russians will do everything they can to use' the occasion for propaganda. 'We've seen the Russians really double down on their propaganda efforts, probably, almost certainly, as a means to distract from their tactical and strategic failures on the battlefield in Ukraine.' Could anything extra happen over the weekend? The Ministry of Defence has not predicted any further aggression to unfold over the weekend, even though Russia's ally Belarus always trains its troops en masse in May. In its daily update, the MoD explained: 'Russia will likely seek to inflate the threat posed to Ukraine by these exercises in order to fix Ukrainian forces in the North, preventing them from being committed to the battle for the Donbas.' However, it added that any 'threat to allies and partners' is not currently anticipated.",

    "4c4dde0386f897e1e10d9a5d2be99b75a42c1e9801bc3a1c18c630bd": "Sadiq Khan has said it is a 'fair point' to draw comparisons between Boris Johnson's birthday party and Keir Starmer's curry gathering in Durham.  The Mayor of London conceded there was an 'equivalence' between the two events, but argued incidents repeatedly took place in Downing Street.  Starmer has struggled to shake off questions about a beer and curry he shared with up to 30 aides on an election visit to Durham last year.  The Labour leader has insisted he went back to work after stopping for the 10pm curry with colleagues during lockdown. However, critics point out a likeness between that and the prime minister and chancellor being issued with fines for a birthday cake shared in the Cabinet Room in 2020. Rishi Sunak was fined despite allegedly stumbling on the birthday gathering by accident while waiting to attend another meeting. Labour called for him to resign following the fine. Pressed on the equivalence between the two events, Khan told TalkTV's Tom Newton Dunn: 'I think you make a fair point. If there was one occasion where an instant happened in Downing Street, I think it's a fair point to say there's equivalence. 'We now know, though, there were many occasions and a culture versus one occasion having a bit of a curry at the end of a campaigning day.  'It's really important your listeners hear this, gathering for campaigning was allowed and what Keir Starmer was doing is not unreasonable, having supper is very different from a culture in Downing Street of 'bring your own bottle', having a karaoke machine and the police finding that in our prime minister, the rule maker, is a rule breaker as well.'  On the same programme Lib Dem leader Ed Davey defended Starmer, saying: 'The police have investigated what happened in Durham and haven't made any charges. They investigated what happened in 10 Downing Street and there were charges.'  Richard Holden, Tory MP for North West Durham, is leading efforts to get the police to re-examine the case after they found there had been no wrongdoing earlier this year. Social gatherings indoors were banned at the time but the Labour Party has insisted no laws were broken because Starmer and colleagues, including deputy leader Angela Rayner, were on a break and returned to work after they had eaten. Starmer accused the Tories of mud-slinging and said it was 'absurd' to suggest that people did not work after 10pm. He told the BBC: 'We stopped, we didn't break the rules, the police looked at it months ago. The rest of it is pure politics from the Conservative Party.'",
    "3f8cb90556adc03c47e9d8e6b1b2db73e8f5be68a96497663b995113": "A few students from nearby Central Saint Martins chat on the steps of the Queer Britain Museum, which is tucked away on one side of Granary Square in King's Cross, London, on the ground floor of a large 19th century building.  After years in the making, this is the UK's first permanent, national LGBTQ+ museum - and it's much needed. As the founders point out, queer people have impacted every part of culture, yet all too often their lives have been written in the margins of history books. This is a space for queer history to be 'preserved, explored and celebrated'. The museum itself is all on one floor, spread across three rooms, and opens with 'Welcome to Queer Britain' - a display showcasing artwork from the LGBTQ+ community alongside historical photographs. Once inside the fully-accessible threshold, the gift shop to the left is most immediately obvious. Laden with colourful memorabilia, it's got the usual staples: high-end chocolate, greetings cards and candles. But it's clear that this is an LGBTQ+ space: a table of books curated by the Gay's the Word bookshop sits in the centre, and there are plenty of rainbows - on badges, bottles and fridge magnets - plus Queer Britain's own branded merchandise. The museum comes after the successes of multiple temporary exhibitions in this area. Earlier this year, the Barbican held its Out and About! installation, exploring LGBTQ+ history in London, while last year, Museums & Galleries Edinburgh launched an online exhibition celebrating young Scottish LGBTQ+ people. Queer Britain will also not be the last: in June, another long-term LGBTQ+ cultural space in London will open, Queercircle in Greenwich. In fact, Queer's Britain's co-founder and director Joseph Galliano explains that it was while at another LGBTQ+ exhibition, the Tate Britain's Queer British Art, that his vision for a permanent museum really solidified. (Though, he had first had the idea as far back as 2007, when he was editor of Gay Times.) Held in 2017, the exhibit marked the 50th anniversary of the partial decriminalisation of male homosexuality. 'I was struck by the fact that so much momentum had been built up around that anniversary within the museums sector,' says Galliano. He spotted an 'opportunity to take that momentum, and broaden it' with his vision of a bricks-and-mortar museum truly reflective of the UK's LGBTQ+ community, including 'women's stories, people of colour, [and] trans people'. With that, Galliano set about putting Queer Britain into action, which he co-founded with Ian Mehrtens alongside a diverse committee of trustees and advisors, including Stonewall co-founder Lisa Power, Trans Britain author Christine Burns, and gal-dem founder Liv Little.  'We made sure that the leadership structures are very diverse,' adds Galliano. Of his hopes for the museum, trustee Krishna Omkar says in an email: 'Our relationship with our past defines our present, and helps direct what is to come. Telling stories that have remained untold, and collating a collective memory of the past is crucial. Representation matters. Remembrance matters.' In the first room, there are two large images: Sadie Lee's domineering oil painting of cabaret artist David Hoyle, whose eyes, shrouded in bright make-up, fixate on the viewer, plus Paul Harfleet's aptly-named Cock of the Rock, named after the South American bird. The second and largest room is split into two sections, the first dedicated to the topic of 'chosen family', originally shown by Queer Britain as a pop-up in collaboration with Levi's in 2019. For this, a series of bright images by four artists - Alia Romagnoli, Bex Day, Kuba Ryniewicz and Robert Taylor - show the diversity of the LGBTQ+ community, including people of colour and those of marginalised gender identities. Also in this room are a series of wide-ranging historical photographs, dating as far back as the 1870s. These cover various milestones in the UK's LGBTQ+ history, such as the introduction of Section 28 in 1988, which banned schools and local authorities from 'promoting' homosexuality, and the legalisation of equal marriage from 2014 in England, Wales and Scotland (followed by Northern Ireland in 2020). Among the imagery are notable figures including Leo Abse, the MP behind the bill that partially decriminalised homosexuality in 1967; TV presenter Sandi Toksvig; and Margeurite Radclyffe Hall, who wrote the classic lesbian novel The Well of Loneliness. The museum's opening comes during a time of increased visibility for LGBTQ+ people, with millions tuning in to watch Netflix's hit series Heartstopper. However, visibility and equality have not come hand-in-hand. Last December, it was reported that homophobic and transgender hate crimes soared in the summer of that year; in the five financial years up to 2021, anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes rose annually, according to official Home Offices figures. The museum's theme is generally jubilant and celebratory, though, with little on the harrowing parts of LGBTQ+ history. For instance, while the AIDS epidemic is briefly referenced, including with a photograph of Princess Diana comforting an HIV-positive man, the museum does not delve into the sheer tragedy of the thousands of gay and bisexual men whose lives were lost during this crisis. A placard highlights the accomplishments of Justin Fashanu, the first openly gay professional footballer - and Britain's first black footballer to command a PS1 million transfer fee - with no mention of his tragic early death, at the age of 37 by suicide. For Galliano, it was a deliberate choice to focus on celebrating queer accomplishments, rather than the tragic parts. 'There is stuff there that needs to be celebrated, rather than just always starting with the sad ending,' he explains. 'That said we have to be telling hard stories and we have to be asking the hard questions.' Still, Galliano notes that displays may be adjusted depending on how they are received by the public. Since being registered as a charity in 2018, Galliano explains how Queer Britain has come up against multiple challenges, most notably financially. 'Funding was always a challenge from the start, [it] will always be a challenge,' he says. This is even more so given that entry to the museum is free, including for its exhibitions. 'If we're going to talk about inclusion, we need to talk about economic inclusion as well,' adds Galliano. The space, too, leased from the Art Fund, came up in January, which, says Galliano, was 'a year earlier than we were expecting...but it was too good an opportunity to not run full tilt', and so what is on display was pulled together quickly, in time for this Spring opening.  In July, Queer Britain will host its first exhibition, marking the 50th anniversary of the UK's first pride parade. Though Galliano is tight-lipped about its content, he says this will consist of a 'heritage items and community voices' which will also go towards 'addressing' representation of all four nations that make up the UK.  The current final room includes portraits from award-winning photographer Allie Crewe, which celebrate the trans and non-binary communities, and two images - both arresting and beautiful - donated by Robert Taylor, who is also a trustee of the museum. For Galliano, this museum is all about giving back to the queer community, alongside showing the richness - and diversity - of its history, not only to those who are LGBTQ+, but also to their heterosexual counterparts. 'I want queer people to feel celebrated, and belonging, and lifted up,' he says, 'and all their friends and families to recognise [where] their stories start and the importance of those.' Queer Britain opens May 5 2022 and is located at 2 Granary Square, London, N1C 4BH and open Wednesday to Sunday from 12pm - 6pm.",

    "a7ccabedfda2b2073e1628ce05d0e92ce22fd504f356e762582e1f12": "Shell has further fuelled demands for a windfall tax on the sector as it revealed record first-quarter profits thanks to soaring oil and gas prices, just days after bumper earnings from rival BP. The oil giant posted better-than-expected underlying earnings for the first three months of 2022, at 9.1 billion US dollars (PS7.2 billion) - nearly three times the 3.2 billion dollars (PS2.5 billion) reported a year earlier. On Tuesday, fellow FTSE 100 firm BP unveiled its highest quarterly underlying profits for more than a decade, at 6.2 billion US dollars (PS5 billion). It comes as calls mount from Labour and the Liberal Democrats for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms to help ease the cost-of-living crisis. The sector is reaping the benefits of rocketing oil and gas prices, which have been pushed to record levels by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and surging demand as economies emerge from the pandemic. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has so far resisted pressure to make the firms pay more tax, instead looking to companies making big profits to invest the cash back into the UK. Ed Miliband, Labour's shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: 'Another day, another oil and gas company making billions in profits, and yet another day when the Government shamefully refuses to act with a windfall tax to bring down bills. 'Even the boss of BP has said that this will not impact investment. The Conservatives have run out of excuses, and been exposed for the political choice they are making by not acting. 'The truth is that the Government's priority is protecting oil and gas giants, not supporting the British people. And Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey condemned the Government's refusal to consider the move. He said: 'Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak's refusal to tax the super-profits of energy companies is completely unforgivable when people are too terrified to heat their homes. 'The excuses of Conservative ministers have been demolished by the boss of BP himself, who said a windfall tax wouldn't damage investment in the UK. 'This one-off levy would raise billions of pounds that could help vulnerable families with their energy bills now. It is a no-brainer.' Campaign group Greenpeace said a windfall tax would be the 'fastest and fairest way to ease pressure on households feeling the pinch and reduce our dependence on oil and gas'. Greenpeace UK's oil and gas campaigner, Philip Evans, said: 'By using a big chunk of the bloated profits that Shell, BP and others are raking in to make homes warmer, more energy-efficient and kitted out with heat pumps, the Government could start to really tackle the climate and cost-of-living crises simultaneously.' Like its FTSE 100 Index rival BP, Shell's figures also showed a hit from its move to pull out of Russia due to the Ukraine war as it booked a 3.9 billion dollar (PS3.1 billion) charge. Despite this, it still saw current cost of supply (CCS) earnings attributable to shareholders jump to 5 billion dollars (PS4 billion) in the quarter, up from 4.3 billion dollars (PS3.4 billion) a year ago, though it was down 38% on the previous three months. Shell said investor dividend payments and share repurchases hit 5.4 billion US dollars (PS4.3 billion) in the quarter, as part of a plan to buy back 8.5 billion US dollars (PS6.8 billion) of shares in the first half of 2022. It increased its dividend to 25 cents (20p) per share and said it also expects shareholder returns to be more than 30% of cashflow in the second half of 2022.",

Nick Boles, a former MP for Grantham and Stamford who served as Boris Johnson's chief of staff while he was mayor of London, said he would be voting Labour for the first time since Tony Blair's 1997 general election landslide.  Boles tweeted: Boles served as a skills minister under David Cameron before going on to be a prominent backbencher critical of a no-deal Brexit. In April 2019, Boles resigned from the Tory party over what he called its 'refusal to compromise' over Brexit. Boles was one of a handful of MPs who had pushed for a Norway-style Common Market 2.0 soft Brexit which was ultimately rejected by the House.  Resigning in the Commons, Boles said: 'I have given everything to an attempt to find a compromise that can take this country out of the European Union while maintaining our economic strength and our political cohesion. 'I accept I have failed. I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise.   'I regret therefore to announce I can no longer sit for this party.' Boles has also been a prominent critic of Johnson. In November 2019, he branded the prime minister a 'compulsive liar' who has betrayed 'every woman who has ever loved him' and revealed he would be voting for the Lib Dems at the general election.  Boles did not contest his seat in the 2019 general election, which is now represented by Tory MP Gareth Davies.  ",

The Hollywood star arrived by helicopter, which then landed onto a US aircraft carrier, during an epic red-carpet arrival at the star-studded first showing of the reboot of the 1986 classic. Despite being able to fly the chopper in question, the actor admitted that someone else was in the cockpit on this occasion.  'No, not today. I do fly that helicopter, but not today,' he said after after touching down and stepping out onto the USS Midway carrier in San Diego, California. The actor said it had been a case of 'now or never' when discussing plans for the sequel, which comes 36 years after the release of the original aviation blockbuster. Due to be released in cinemas on 27 May, the sequel sees Tom reprise the role of US naval aviator Pete Mitchell. Other stars include Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Monica Barbaro, Val Kilmer, Jon Hamm and Glen Powell. 'This moment right here, getting to see everyone, no masks. This is pretty epic,' he said, speaking to Deadline at the event. 'It was really now or never, it was a moment, we were looking at how to tell this story... I've been thinking about it and figuring it out. 'I thought if we're going to go in, we have to go in now.' He added: 'Of course (Top Gun) is this great summer experience, and what it became to audiences and generations is something I could never have imagined at the time we were making it. 'But it's a drama at its heart and it has that kind of storytelling that I cut my teeth on, that I love seeing with these characters. 'The movie means a lot to me, a lot to my career, a lot to the studio and a lot to audiences.' Tom provided his cast members with a rigorous training programme in preparation for the film, including real-life jet plane flying lessons. 'This cast is amazing, they're unbelievable these guys... they're a very talented group,' he said. The actor was praised by his co-stars as a 'mentor and friend' who 'cares that everybody wins'. 'Tom Cruise doesn't half-arse anything,' said Glen Powell, who plays Hangman in the film. 'Without Tom on this movie being our flight instructor, our mentor, our friend, there is no way we could pull this off. 'Tom is Maverick in real life, he's as cool as it gets. 'The thing that makes him special is that he cares that everybody wins. You watch this movie and every single character in the movie wins, everyone looks cool.

    "053143f3d6d08b3dcea74ce4abfeb0f900aaf3cc07aed864efc0eeb7": "Kim Kardashian's love for Marilyn Monroe just hit a whole new level.  Before the The Kardashians star rocked the late blonde bombshell's iconic 'Happy Birthday, Mr. President' dress to the 2022 Met Gala, she was gifted a lock of Monroe's hair from the Ripley's Believe It or Not! headquarters in Orlando, Florida.  During her Met Gala dress fitting, the museum team surprised Kim with a silver box containing actual strands of Monroe's legendary platinum hair. The reality star wasn't shy about revealing her bizarre plans for Monroe's tresses.  'Oh, my God, I'm literally going to do some crazy voodoo shit [to] channel her,' the reality star said in the video. 'This is so special to me. Thank you so much. This is so cool.' 'Wow, this is sleeping with me every night,' Kim added, turning to boyfriend Pete Davidson. 'Sorry, babe.' The Ripley's team also filled her Met Gala dressing room with an array of Marilyn Monroe and JFK memorabilia to make sure the fashionista had ample inspiration for her look. Kim confessed, however, that fitting into the dress was no easy task - she had to lose 16 pounds in three weeks. 'I would wear a sauna suit twice a day, run on the treadmill, completely cut out all sugar and all carbs, and just eat the cleanest veggies and protein,' she told Vogue on the red carpet. 'I didn't starve myself, but I was so strict.' Kim marked only the second time in history that the famous garment has been tried on, according to an Instagram post from Ripley's museum. 'The dress was transported by guards and I had to wear gloves to try it on,' she said. The American franchise that specialises in showcasing oddities captured Kim's emotional moment as she tried on the dress that had been preserved as a piece of pop culture history.  The problem was the dress wouldn't fully zip over her frame.  The museum had to consult with garment conservationists, appraisers and archivists to figure out the best way to preserve the condition of the dress since alterations could not be made to the gown.  In order to make it work, Kim wore a white, vintage fur coat that draped over the zipper, which was only partially fastened.  She didn't change into the dress until she was ready to stroll the red carpet, she said. She left her hotel on Monday in just a fitting gown and changed into the historic dress in a small room at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. After the initial big reveal on the red carpet, she changed into a replica dress to protect the piece of history. She then celebrated her three weeks of dieting by throwing a donut and pizza party in her hotel room.  On Monday night, she shared videos on her Instagram story showcasing the mini donut station and slew of pizza boxes on a table in her room.  'You guys, I haven't had carbs or sugar in almost a month,' she said. 'Definitely three weeks. This pizza -- I'm so excited!' Despite enduring disapproval from critics for endangering the gown by borrowing it, the head of Monroe's estate, Nick Woodhouse, sounded off his approval. He told TMZ he and his partners believe Monroe would have celebrated Kim's fashion tribute, citing similarities between the two icons.",
    "dfd478b290c3d1283a2c514bf590c85ddfd822e949de09a2aac063b5": "Kim Cattrall has broken her silence on the Sex And The City reboot And Just Like That, revealing that she was never asked to be a part of the series and that she found out about it through social media. The British-born actor starred as Samantha Jones in the original six series of the show, which ran from 1998 to 2004, as well as two feature films released in 2008 and 2010. The reboot sees Sarah Jessica Parker return as New York City columnist Carrie Bradshaw, Cynthia Nixon as Miranda Hobbes and Kristin Davis as Charlotte York. In an interview with Variety, Kim said she was not approached to reprise her character as she had previously made her 'feelings clear' after she turned down a script for a possible third movie in 2017. 'The series is basically the third movie. That's how creative it was,' she said. 'I was never asked to be part of the reboot. I made my feelings clear after the possible third movie, so I found out about it like everyone else did -- on social media.' Samantha had been written into the script for the potential third movie, which would have seen her receive unwanted 'dick pics' from Brady, Miranda's 14-year-old son - a storyline she described as 'heartbreaking'. Remarking that it was an 'understatement' to say her character wasn't progressing, Kim went on to offer what she believed to be a more compelling storyline. 'Why can't Samantha, who owns her PR company -- maybe she had to sell it because of financial woes? 2008 was tough,' she said. 'I mean that's a scenario that was kind of off the top of one of my reps' heads, and I thought that's a great idea. That's a conflict. Instead of an underage boy's...' 'I would have preferred for all of us to have some kind of event to warrant a third film. That didn't happen. But also, I was ready,' she added. 'As difficult as it was, and as scary as it is to stand up and not be bullied by the press or the fans or whomever -- to just say, I'm good. I'm on this track. It was so great working with you. I so enjoyed it, but I'm over here.' Kim also admitted that she had not watched the new 10-part series, which debuted earlier this year. Reflecting on why she closed the door on playing Samantha, she said: 'It's a great wisdom to know when enough is enough. 'I also didn't want to compromise what the show was to me. The way forward seemed clear.' Despite Kim's physical absence from the reboot, her character lives on in the series -- with Carrie communicating with Samantha via text throughout the season -- which Kim said was 'odd' and 'feels different than the Samantha that I played.' The show also depicted a dissolution of the pair's friendship after Samantha was apparently dropped as Carrie's publicist, prompting Samantha to move to London. For years there have been reports of a real-life rift between Kim and SJP, with some concluding this influenced her departure. Discussing her relationship with her Sex And The City co-stars, Kim said: 'I think we were colleagues. My colleagues aren't my friends. It was professional.' She admitted she found it 'odd' that she was still referenced in the latest storyline, but said knowing fans wanted more of her was a 'really wonderful feeling'. She added: 'That feels powerful, that I've left something behind that I'm so proud of. I loved her. I loved her so, so, so much. 'It's tough competition. The original show is in all of our imaginations. But for me, it feels clean.' She added that parts of her character, who became beloved by millions of fans for her sex-positive and ambitious attitude, remain with her and she feels 'ultimately protective of her'. Kim has since appeared in the new How I Met Your Father TV series as well as a reboot of 1999 series Queer As Folk.",
    "2b525e86482fd838574e25a35061efdc744841d00340384ea518a97b": "Since 1973, Roe v. Wade has protected the right of all Americans to access safe and legal abortions. But a leaked document published by Politico on Monday shows that the federal protections conferred by Roe may be struck down by the US Supreme Court this summer.  If Roe falls, the legality of abortion will be determined by each state. And though a handful of states are passing legislation that will protect the right to get an abortion, many others -- 26 to be exact -- are expected to quickly ban or restrict abortions.  If this happens, millions of people in the US will no longer be able to access safe abortion care within their communities. They'll have to wait longer and travel farther to access help. The impact on people's mental and physical health - along with their finances, families and livelihoods - will be astronomical.  Despite the misinformation that swirls around the internet (and beyond), abortions are extremely safe procedures. They're also incredible common - about one in four women will have an abortion by the time they are 45 - and, in many cases, they are life-saving.  'It is a common procedure, it is very safe, and I can't emphasise that enough. This draft ruling is egregious, it is a basically a war against women,' Dr. Melissa Simon, a Northwestern Medicine OB/GYN, tells HuffPost.  Here's what people get wrong about abortion One of the most common misconceptions about abortions is that the procedure is dangerous or detrimental to one's health.  A report from 2018 examined the safety of various methods of abortion - medication, aspiration, dilation and evacuation, and induction - and concluded that abortions are safe and effective and that complications from all types of abortions are rare.  It's the barriers and restrictions that legislators sign to prevent patients from easily and swiftly accessing abortion that jeopardise their health. It's well known that delaying abortion care increases the risk of complications.  Some US states require doctors to tell their patients that there's a link between breast cancer and abortion - despite the fact that many high-quality studies have put this question to rest, according to Dr. Jennifer Kerns, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynaecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.  Others fear that abortions cause infertility, but research hasn't found a link between abortions and the ability to conceive in the future. There's also no evidence that abortions increase the risk of complications (ie. preterm birth or low birth weight delivery) in the event of a future pregnancy. Another long-running mistruth is that abortions increase the risk of developing mental health issues. 'There is a huge body of work demonstrating that abortion in and of itself does not cause mental health problems,' Kerns says, noting that people often feel relief after getting an abortion.  What we do know is that unwanted pregnancies can cause significant maternal depression and parenting stress. And those mental health issues don't clear up with time; they are often long-lasting, afflicting the women who carried the unwanted pregnancies to term well into their 30s, 40s and 50s.  Many people falsely believe pregnancy is easy to avoid, but it's not that straightforward. Kerns sees many people, from all walks of life and phases of reproductive health, seeking an abortion. Contraception - though invaluable - is not foolproof. Birth control is not 100% effective; it can fail and lead to a pregnancy.  'Even in the setting of using contraception and safe-sex practices, having the option of an abortion is critical to the life and both physical and mental health of the woman,' Simon says.  Many anti-abortion bills have been labelled 'heartbeat bills' because they ban abortions at the first sign of foetal cardiac activity. This nomenclature is wildly misleading - while primordial electrical activity can be detected around six weeks of pregnancy, this does not mean a foetus has a functioning heart. The heart, valves and vessels do not form until 16-18 weeks of pregnancy.  'Just having cardiac activity does not mean the foetus, if born at that moment, would be able to survive,' Simon says.  Restricting abortion impacts people's health and livelihoods Evidence shows that being denied an abortion has a devastating impact on one's physical health, mental health and overall well-being.  The Turnaway Study, conducted by scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, found that women who carry an unwanted pregnancy to term have a four times greater chance of being below the US federal poverty level. They're also more likely to experience serious health complications, such as eclampsia and death, and to develop mental health issues, including anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. They're more likely to stick with an abusive partner; their life goals tend to take a back seat, and their families' livelihoods suffer. Many go on to experience chronic pain.  'The health and welfare of the citizens of this country suffer - we see increased illness, we see increased poverty and we see increased death,' Kerns says.  Restricting the right to an abortion does not mean the need for an abortion disappears. A recent study predicted that banning abortion will lead to a 21% increase in pregnancy-related deaths; that jumps to 33% among Black women. Maternal mortality rates are at an all-time high. The US already has the highest maternal death rate among developed nations -- and that crisis would only get worse without access to safe abortion.   'There are some women who get pregnant who could die if they continue with the pregnancy, and, therefore, an abortion is a life-saving procedure in those circumstances,' says Simon, adding that those circumstances are not rare. Abortions, in many cases, can save the life of the mother.  Here's what the fall of Roe could mean for health care Kerns said the leaked document demonstrates that the court is no longer a neutral group. 'It really lays bare how out of touch their rulings are with people's lives,' Kerns said.  Much of the language used in abortion restrictions and bans - like 'abortionists' - really deeply divides people and shames those who get an abortion or provide an abortion.  Simon says the potential fall of Roe reflects a crisis in women's health care, specifically when it comes to maternal health. The end of Roe would mark a war against women and people who can get pregnant, who, for the record, comprise over 50% of the US population, she adds.  Simon is exceedingly concerned about what will happen to the growing maternal death rate if Roe falls and safe abortion care becomes harder and harder to access.  'That is what I am very worried about in this country - that we are going to go even more in the wrong direction than we already are with respect to caring for over half of our population: women,' Simon says.

The topic of porn can be a taboo subject, but we need to talk about it - especially in relationships. This week's reader, Jenny, wrote in to ask for advice related to her husband's porn consumption.  'My partner is watching porn and won't have sex with me,' she said. 'I found out that my husband is into porn and he won't turn from his ways. He's pleasuring himself but won't have sex with me, what should I do?' Navigating a situation like this can be tricky, but Counselling Directory member Georgina Smith is here to help.  How can this reader speak to her husband about this? 'Like any difficult subject in a relationship, pick a time when you are both able to talk freely, raising it when you are both calm and able to discuss rationally, don't wait until an argument,' Smith says. 'Invite some open conversation about his feelings around his porn habit and how that makes you feel - try to use empathy and good listening skills. 'Explore how you could find your way back to a sex life you both enjoy to feel more connected. You are entitled to express your desire for sex in a relationship and how their rejection may be causing you hurt.' When does watching porn become an issue in a relationship? Smith believes that watching porn in a relationship becomes an issue when it causes harm to the partner. 'Some people perceive watching porn as a form of infidelity, especially if it is done in secret,' she says. 'If porn watching is essentially a substitution for actual sex and that is impacting on the relationship (by stopping a couple connecting via sex and intimacy), I would consider that to be an issue. 'If watching porn has become addictive (i.e. unable to stop even if viewer wants to stop) then that person may need specialist help.' What should we do when porn becomes an issue in our relationship? Smith emphasises that we should 'communicate effectively around the subject, don't avoid it just because it can sometimes be an uncomfortable conversation.' 'Try to understand where you are both coming from if you have opposing views around porn and figure out how you might find a common ground that keeps both of you happy,' Smith says. 'Get some couple counselling to unpack in a safe space and reflect individually why you feel the way you do about porn would be two helpful places to start.'

    "02726c90dee4e40cf8fed022cac9614a39e1d2528e4d51685b5eab70": "Every so often, a parenting style makes the headlines: attachment parenting, helicopter parenting, free-range parenting. But in child psychology, based on the work of Diana Baumrind, a developmental psychologist, experts point to four main parenting styles - neglectful, authoritarian, authoritative and permissive - that influence how children grow and interact.  'Without a lot of intentional thought, parenting styles are often a combination of learned instincts gained from a parent's own experience, temperament and role models,' says Rachel Robertson, vice president of education at Bright Horizons. 'It doesn't mean a parent is stuck with whatever style comes most naturally to them, if it isn't ideal.' She emphasises parents can fluctuate between styles depending on the situation - and by having awareness and intention can make thoughtful choices and create habits that will help them raise their kids the way they want.  'Simply being aware of effective parenting strategies can help a parent pause and act purposefully in a moment they may have otherwise acted instinctually or emotionally,' Robertson explains. 'Parenting is an in-the-moment kind of activity but it also is really about the long game - parents are raising human beings who we all hope grow to be contributing citizens, future leaders, lifelong learners and stewards of the future they will inherit.' HuffPost spoke with Robertson and family therapist Kelly Oriard to break down the four parenting styles and how each approach affects children.  Neglectful ''[Neglectful] style is hands-off and uninvolved,' Robertson says. 'This style may be intentional or unintentional, depending on the parent. Communication, interaction and involvement in activities is limited.' To better understand neglectful parenting and the other three styles, it's important to consider emotional climate, which is basically the overall mood and perception of a family and the relationship dynamics within it. 'For children, emotional climate, especially a warm emotional climate, is your caregiver wanting to be involved with your interests, supporting you, cheering you on and being responsive to your needs,' says Oriard, who is a co-founder of Slumberkins, an educational brand focused on emotional learning. 'It can look like snuggling up to read their favourite story or supporting them after something didn't quite go their way.' In the neglectful parenting style, there's low emotional warmth, as this type of caregiver tends to have low levels of interaction with their child.  'When disciplining, these parents tend to choose harsher techniques and offer little to no explanation,' Oriard says. 'This parent is like the boss who you barely see at work. You end up learning on the fly and figuring it out because direction and interaction is minimal. Then if you do make a mistake because of the low level of direction, your boss becomes enraged and takes it out on you in front of your peers and higher-ups.' She noted that this type of boss would not circle back or touch base with you, might dismiss you on the spot and may leave you feeling anxious about making future mistakes. A neglectful parent can leave similar negative feelings.  'Unfortunately, children who have neglectful-uninvolved parents tend to have numerous problems as they grow up,' Oriard says. 'These children may have mental health struggles related to depression and anxiety, they may have poor social skills and can even be prone to future substance abuse.' Authoritarian 'Authoritarian parents expect children to listen, follow directions and obey,' Robertson says. 'This style is considered to be strict and a disciplinarian. There is a lack of flexibility and high expectation of compliance.' Similar to the neglectful parenting style, authoritarian parenting involves low emotional warmth, but what makes it different is a high level of demand and control - terms that refer to the extent to which parents try to control their child's behaviour and development. 'We all want our children to be accepted and liked and part of that is helping them to navigate social norms,' Oriard says. 'When demandingness and control become problematic is when adults take an adult-centred approach and try to control their child for their benefit instead of for the betterment of the child.' She notes that the authoritarian style's combination of low emotional warmth and high demandingness can feel particularly strict and cold. 'Without the emotional support, these kids can struggle socially and suffer from mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression,' Oriard explains. 'This is due to the fact that high demandingness without a warm emotional climate can create an environment that is not only about behavioural control but psychological control. Psychological control is much harsher and uses shame and guilt to manipulate the child or coerce the child into doing what the caregiver wants or expects of them.' Under her office analogy above, this scenario is like having a boss who only cares about productivity and goals and is relentless about how they achieve those goals. This boss doesn't seem to care about the employee as a person and fosters a cold, harsh and restrictive environment. Authoritative 'Authoritative parents set clear expectations and provide structure and routine but remain flexible,' Robertson says. 'There is a clear parent-child dynamic, but children are respected, listened to and given choices. Authoritative parents are nurturing and reliable.' Research indicates that the authoritative style is the most beneficial for children's development and thus the style to strive for as a parent. It's about creating a warm emotional climate coupled with a healthy, moderate-to-high level of demandingness and control.  'This is the boss that we all love working for,' Oriard says. 'This boss is in the office and is friendly and welcoming to all of their employees. They know that Suzy fell off her bike last week and checked in to see how she was doing. This boss has high expectations of all their employees but communicates this openly and is willing to discuss trying things in a different way if you feel like it would help you.' For children, an authoritative parent is supportive, responsive and nurturing. They are kind, caring and loving but also set firm limits and have high expectations. They explain their reasoning and listen to their child's viewpoint, even if they don't indulge it. 'When high expectations are coupled with a warm emotional climate, kids are better able to thrive,' Oriard says. 'While neglectful-uninvolved parenting leads to numerous negative outcomes, authoritative parenting is known as the style that creates the most positive outcomes for children.' Permissive 'Permissive parents are warm and loving, but this style is without a lot of rules or structure,' Robertson notes. 'Sometimes this parent would be described as more of a friend relationship than parental. There is a lot less direction or expectation and children are given a lot of autonomy and a voice in most decisions. If rules are set, they are often unenforced.' Permissive parenting involves a warm emotional climate but low demandingness and control. 'If their child hits your child on the playground, they do not jump up to correct the behaviour, they just let it go and chalk it up to kids being kids,' Oriard says. 'In the office, this is the boss who doesn't exactly know what is up. They don't have a lot of demands and let you do your own thing. If you mess up a huge project, it's fine. No worries. You yelled at your client over the phone? Not a problem.' She noted that children of permissive parents tend to have behavioural issues and struggle socially.  'They might also struggle a bit at school or in environments where there are rules to follow,' Oriard adds.  Like the other styles, this one isn't fixed. There are practical ways to make changes to move away from a less effective style and more toward an authoritative style. 'If a parent tends to be more permissive and have informal schedules or unpredictability in routine, this can be tricky for children as they use routines and schedules to learn about the patterns of the day, what to expect, how to feel secure and what can be relied on,' Robertson says. 'A permissive parent can start by creating a consistent bedtime routine, knowing this will help their child's development.' Still, even the best of parents won't be authoritative 100% of the time. Everyone has days when they're less patient or more indulgent than they would normally be. 'It is OK to be flexible and to do the best you can each day,' Oriard sys. 'Understanding these parenting styles is just a small window into understanding how we as caregivers can best support our children as they grow into amazing adults. All any of us can hope for is that when they are grown, our children will be caring, confident and resilient members of our community.'",
    "c3fe8b6307793f807977a51239e7e10a154659323d240504312b4d34": "The chunky silver rings Johnny Depp is fond of wearing made it hurt more when he allegedly slapped Amber Heard, she told a Virginia courtroom on Wednesday as part of a weekslong defamation trial. Through a $50 million lawsuit, Depp is accusing his ex-wife of lying about her abuse allegations, made over the course of the couple's acrimonious split in 2016, when she sought a restraining order against him.  The Pirates of the Caribbean star testified last month, alleging that Heard had actually abused him during their relationship, in one incident by throwing a glass bottle that shattered and severed his fingertip. He has repeatedly denied all accusations of abuse. Wednesday was the first time the court was able to learn directly from Heard how Depp allegedly used his money and charm to cover up shocking behaviour. Heard described a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde scenario where Depp -- who has spoken candidly about his struggles with alcohol and drug addiction -- would sometimes show warmth, but sometimes be 'this other thing'.  'And that other thing was [an] awful, awful thing that would come out and take over, and it was hard to see the Johnny I loved underneath it. And no one told him. No one was honest with him,' Heard testified, referring to the people who managed Depp's career. 'He'd pass out in his own vomit, he'd lose control of his body, and everybody would clean up after him. I cleaned up after him,' she said, adding that she once saw Depp's bodyguards change him out of soiled pants. Heard told of a bizarre situation in which she was driving with Depp to an event and, along the way, the actor allegedly grabbed a teacup Yorkie and held it out the window of the moving vehicle while 'howling'. Despite there being other, unnamed people in the car, Heard said, no one reacted.  She became emotional during her hours of testimony, at times speaking haltingly. Depp looked down at the table in front of him much of the time; he appeared to be writing. The actors were married briefly in 2015 and 2016, having met on the set of the 2011 film The Rum Diary, which starred Depp. Asked to describe the first time Depp struck her, Heard began by telling the court that Depp had been drinking and, she suspected, using cocaine, since there was a 'vintage jar' of the drug nearby.  'He slapped me across the face, and I laughed. I laughed. Because I didn't know what else to do. I thought this must be a joke. This must be a joke because I didn't know what was going on,' Heard testified. 'He said, 'You think it's so funny? You think it's funny, bitch? You think you're a funny bitch?' And he slapped me again,' she said. Depp allegedly struck her a third time, causing her to lose her balance. Earlier in the trial, recordings were played of Depp screaming at Heard and calling her names. 'I knew it was wrong, and I had to leave him,' Heard said of the alleged assault. 'And that's what broke my heart, because I didn't want to leave him.' Then Depp started crying, Heard testified, and assuring her on his knees that he would never hit her again. Depp spoke about his addiction issue as if it were a 'monster' that he killed, saying he thought he had 'put that fucker away', according to Heard. At various times, she said that Depp hit her and broke things near her, appearing upset about the idea that Heard could be seeing other people. Heard said Depp took issue with low-cut clothing, commenting: 'That's really what you're wearing, kid?' She described a pattern in which Depp would 'blow up' and then 'disappear', returning after he had sobered up. Later in their relationship, Heard said that Depp started hiding his alcohol and drug use from her, leaving her to make educated guesses about the state he was in. 'Johnny on speed is very different from Johnny on opiates. And Johnny on opiates [is] very different from Johnny on Adderall, and Cocaine Johnny, which is very different from Quaaludes Johnny,' Heard said.  In one particularly horrific episode, Heard alleged that Depp became irate one night, ripped her dress partially off, groped her body and 'proceeded to do a cavity search.' 'He said he was looking for his drugs, his cocaine, his coke,' she said. The alleged incident took place at an isolated 'trailer park' retreat that had been rented, and when the manager took a look at the damage Depp had supposedly done to the place, Heard said he was angry -- until speaking to Depp, who smoothed things over. She is expected to resume testimony on Thursday.",
    "c6cd167bab18c0d9c641dee4d04d76419ae723212b4541d7dfbba35b": "If the polls have it right, Northern Ireland could be on the brink of seismic change.  Ever since the Protestant-majority state was found a century ago after the republic of Ireland's independence from Britain, its governments have been led by unionist politicians who defined themselves as British. But one recent survey had Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), with an 8-point advantage ahead of Thursday's election for the Northern Ireland Assembly. If the Irish nationalist party which seeks union with Ireland comes out on top for the first time in the province, it would represent an historic shift 24 years after the Good Friday peace agreement ended three decades of sectarian bloodshed. Sinn Fein, once a political pariah, would be closer to becoming the lead party in government on both sides of the Irish border, and the debate around Northern Ireland withdrawing from the United Kingdom of England, Scotland and Wales would intensify. Who are Sinn Fein? The party has long been linked to the IRA, a paramilitary group that used bombs and bullets to try to take Northern Ireland out of UK rule during decades of violence. But Sinn Fein in 2022 is led by a younger generation of politicians with fewer links to the IRA and Northern Ireland's Troubles, when 3,600 people were killed. A milestone triumph at Stormont this week shouldn't come as a surprise, as Sinn Fein was just one seat behind the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the biggest pro-British party, in 2017. The party is also well placed to win elections in the republic of Ireland, which are due by 2025.  United Ireland downplayed While a united Ireland is Sinn Fein's over-arching aim, the issue has not been central to its campaign efforts. Instead, and in common with most elections set against the cost of living crisis, the focus has been on bread-and-butter issues. Constitutional goals are so little mentioned that Irish unity takes up just one page in the 17-page manifesto. Michelle O'Neill, the party's leader in Northern Ireland, said during a televised election debate she was not 'fixated on a date' for a unification referendum. 'The things that the public want us to respond to is trying to put money in their pockets to help them deal with the cost-of-living crisis,' she said. How would it work? If Sinn Fein does make history, it could trigger a constitutional crisis. Under Northern Ireland's power-sharing system, created by the 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of Catholic-Protestant conflict, the jobs of first minister and deputy first minister are split between the biggest unionist party and the largest nationalist one. Both posts must be filled for a government to function. The DUP, which has been the largest in the Northern Ireland Assembly for two decades, has suggested it might not serve under a Sinn Fein first minister. The new elected politicians will meet next week to try to form an executive. If none can be formed within six months, the administration will collapse, triggering a new election and more uncertainty. Is Brexit an issue?  Brexit bolstered the case for a united Ireland after a majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the European Union, and the controversy over post-Brexit customs and border checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK has prompted anger. The arrangement was designed to maintain an open border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, a key pillar of the peace process. But unionists say the new checks have created a barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK that undermines their British identity. The instability has led to rising tensions and sporadic violence. The DUP also says it will refuse to join a new government unless there are major changes to the post-Brexit border arrangements under the Northern Ireland Protocol. DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said during the TV debate: 'The political institutions must be sustainable. And that means we have got to deal with the big issues that are in front of us, not least the harm that the Northern Ireland Protocol is doing to undermine political stability in Northern Ireland.' Changing politics in Northern Ireland Voting along strict tribal lines is crumbling as more support is going to parties that identify as neither nationalist nor unionist, with young people increasingly rejecting the traditional labels. A collapse in support over the last 18 months for the DUP has paved the way for Sinn Fein to take the office of first minister, and polls showed that even the cross-community Alliance Party could catch the DUP - an unthinkable prospect five years ago. Anger over the post-Brexit checks is set to spilt the unionist vote share more widely this time compared to 2017. Nonetheless, pro-British parties are using Sinn Fein's push to withdraw Northern Ireland from the UK, and a potentially divisive border poll, to galvanise support. Is re-unification inevitable? The immediate effects of a Sinn Fein victory are likely be symbolic, and there's very little certainty about any path towards a united Ireland. Even if Sinn Fein were to win in the Republic, there could be problems forming a government there too. What's more, nationalists with the upper hand on both sides of the border could deter less hardline voters from backing re-unification.  It is also solely up to the British government under the terms of the 1998 peace deal to call a referendum if they believe a 'yes' majority looks likely. Opinion polls have consistently shown most voters in Northern Ireland favour the status quo. But it's not inconceivable to think a united Ireland could soon become as dominant an issue as independence is in Scotland, and the future of a United Kingdom is put in great doubt.",

    "f737a3b8519f5c6a1567f79af04986e5a992033dc8ad24181bfbcff1": "Downing Street's partygate scandal has been a godsend for Labour ever since it broke at the end of last year. Barely a week has gone by without further developments in the scandal over lockdown-busting parties in and around Number 10. Boris Johnson's personal poll ratings have tumbled, as have the Tories', as voters vent their anger. Even Rishi Sunak has lost his shine after being issued with a Metropolitan Police fine for attending a birthday bash for the prime minister in the Cabinet Room on June 19, 2020. But that invaluable political capital gifted to Labour now risks being squandered as Keir Starmer finds himself fending off his own allegations of breaking covid laws. It has also raised questions about the Labour leader's ability to get himself out of a tight spot when pursued aggressively by the tabloid media. The timing could not have been worse for Starmer, with voters across the UK going to the polls tomorrow. When a grainy photo of Starmer drinking a bottle of beer while campaigning in Durham first emerged a year ago, it was met with little fanfare. Starmer explained he and his team had paused to have a takeaway before getting back to work. Confirmation from Durham Police that they were satisfied no rules were broken appeared to suggest it was case closed. But a drip feed of new details -- including that up to 30 people may have been in attendance and that a PS200 Indian takeaway was ordered at 9pm -- threatens to make Labour's attacks on the Tories redundant, given the charges of hypocrisy and double standards that have inevitably followed. Party sources have also expressed frustration at the way the story has been handled, citing Starmer's refusal earlier this week to answer basic questions on whether Durham Police had spoken to him. Labour later confirmed that they had not. One party insider told HuffPost UK that they believed Lynton Crosby, Johnson's Australian poll guru, was 'eating Keir alive' over what the right-wing press have dubbed 'beergate'. 'Lynton Crosby is behaving like a fox in the hen house, smashing Labour's amateur and out-of-depth comms operation all over his Belgravia tennis court,' they said. 'It's classic Crosby -- kill your opponent's cat and throw it in their face. 'Labour now looks exactly the same as the Tories, and cannot get their message across days before the local elections.' Another source suggested the party needed to go harder and be clearer about the difference between Starmer's situation and the No.10 parties being investigated by the Metropolitan Police. 'We had a curry and a beer while we were working, they wheeled in a suitcase of booze and held a mock press conference where they joked about their wine and cheese party,' they said. 'We were working, they were on the lash while loved ones died without their families around them. 'It's completely different and the only reason anyone is trying to say anything different is because the Conservative Party don't want to talk about why people can't pay their bills. 'Keir should go for them -- but that sort of attack just isn't his strong suit. 'This is the Tory political operation - create a stench of wrongdoing even if there isn't one, and that will keep the real issues off the table.' When HuffPost UK spoke to Starmer about beergate while on the campaign trail, he made clear he felt no rules had been broken. 'We were working in the office, it was a few days before the election, we paused for food, carried on,' he said. 'No breach of the rules, no party, the police looked at it months ago and decided there was nothing wrong, and that's the long and the short of it.' What makes Labour's headache worse is the unambiguous stance it has taken towards Met Police fines.  After Johnson and Sunak were slapped with fixed penalty notices, Starmer called for both of them to go. Sunak has, by some, been seen as hard-done by, given that by his account, he stumbled on the birthday gathering by accident while waiting to attend another meeting. If Starmer believes that demands a resignation, then his beer in Durham would most likely warrant his too. Some allies believe Starmer's reputation as a former director of public prosecutions will ultimately help reinforce his reputation as law maker and not a law breaker. While Johnson has a reputation for playing fast and loose with the truth, Starmer is known for his seriousness. 'Keir was upfront when he said it was just mudslinging,' one ally said. 'He was DPP -- he is not going to actively bend any rules or laws. The police haven't been in touch. 'Keir was saying, in a very legalistic sense, that the case has been closed.' Voters will decide on Thursday whether they share the same verdict -- or whether this latest episode confirms the suspicion that all politicians are the same.",
    "4fc625ea076a15806619a4272aebc117012fe7ac520485c06e505112": "The BBC launched a 'Deprivation Study' to find out how people felt without the national service - and the outcome, published on Tuesday, just might deter its critics. The broadcaster commissioned the study from researchers MTM following uproar over its licence fee, which the culture secretary Nadine Dorries recently froze for two years. This means the levy will not rise with inflation (which is at a 30-year high) and so the institution is facing a PS2 billion funding cut. The government has also floated the idea of scrapping the licence fee altogether. To uncover how the general public actually feel about the institution, this new research took 80 households and deprived them of BBC content for nine days (including two weekends). This meant no TV and radio, recipes, podcasts, or access to social media platforms linked the broadcaster. After their hiatus, the participants were handed an envelope with the value of that nine days of content - it worked out to be less than PS4. The BBC licence fee is PS159 per year, or PS53.50 for black and white TVs. The study was meant to 'uncover the value of the BBC to households in the competitive media environment' of 2020 and 2021. Around 200 people were involved in the study and there was an emphasis on those who, 'if it was down to them, they would rather forego the BBC so they do not have to pay the licence fee and those who say the licence fee is too high'. Before the research began, 30 households said they wanted to pay nothing and not receive the BBC's services; another 30 said they would pay less than the current licence fee and the remaining 20 said they would pay the current fee or more. Out of the 60 who were not keen on the current price, 42 said they would now pay the full licence fee or more after the experiment - that means 70% changed their minds. Only one household out of the 20 who initially supported it said they would pay less. These results echoed the findings from the first time MTM conducted such a study into the public's perception of the BBC, back in 2014 and 2015. MTM concluded: 'Both times - with a sample of 150 households across the two waves - would indicate that people's initial view of the value of the licence fee and the BBC is most often likely to be an underestimation.' Afterwards, people were apparently more appreciative that the BBC is ad-free and high quality when compared to its competitors, and they found it was the BBC they wanted to turn to for most trustworthy news. One person told MTM: 'When you look at it, it offers more than what you think. You tend to just think the BBC channels and a bit of radio but like ... there's a lot more to it. There's all your websites, and obviously all the learning stuff for the kids. 'And I didn't realise how much I check on the weather and the news, and when you break it down to PS3 it's not that much really.' The content available on BBC Food and CBeebies were particularly praised, especially when compared to its competitors and the upcoming streaming platforms like Netflix. Yet, 19 of the 80 participants left the study and still wanted to pay less or nothing. One person allegedly pointed out that they don't like how 'everyone has to pay the same set amount regardless' of how much they use BBC content. Despite this encouraging research, more cuts to the BBC are expected to come soon as it looks to make up the losses from Dorries' tightening its budget. At the moment, the BBC is used by 90% of UK adults each week for around 18 hours on average.",
    "bc0d15241c96403f3c5e7649e5ff369a69127ce96c4cb46e9abe7c2d": "Boris Johnson has insisted the government will not impose a windfall tax on energy firms - because the companies themselves 'don't want' one. The prime minister insisted a one-off levy on their bumper profits would stop them being able to invest in jobs and renewable energy. But he was undermined by Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP, who told The Times that a windfall tax would not stop any projects they currently have planned. Labour and the Lib Dems have both called for a levy on the huge profits currently being enjoyed by energy companies as a result of the global spike in oil and gas prices. Asked if Looney's comments had changed his views on the merits of a windfall tax, the prime minister said: '[Energy firms] don't want a windfall tax and there's a good reason for that, and that is because it would stop investment in new technology and in new green power that we need. 'The problem we have got is that ... this is an incredible country, incredible economy, fifth biggest in the world, but we're mainlining energy from France. It's insane. 'We haven't invested enough in our own domestic energy and we need these big energy companies to step up to the plate and put their money into sustainable solutions, more green energy and to help keep costs down. 'That is a much, much better solution than clobbering them and dissuading them, stopping them from making that investment. We need those companies to be investing now in the power supply that is going to keep costs down.' Pat McFadden, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: 'The prime minister's comments make it clear, the Conservatives are only interested in protecting oil and gas profits while Labour is on the side of working families. 'BP's chief executive has said that a windfall tax would not affect investment plans and profits are so high that the company is planning to buy back shares. 'This government is now at the point of defending the indefensible and is letting families struggle rather than taking sensible action. 'A vote for Labour on Thursday is a vote for our plan that would save people up to PS600 on their bills, supporting families when they need it most. Britain deserves better.'",

The Spice Girls singer was honoured during an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace, having become a patron of the charity Women's Aid in 2018 after leaving what she has described as an abusive relationship. Speaking to the PA news agency after collecting her MBE, Mel was asked about her conversation with the Duke of Cambridge. 'He commended me on all my work that I've been doing, and he goes, 'I'm so sorry you went through such a horrible time',' she said.  'He did say, 'I can't believe I'm giving you one of these - I'm delighted', and I said, 'Aw thank you' and we had a giggle.' Mel also said she was dedicating her MBE to 'all the other women' who are dealing with domestic violence.  'I never thought I would be here getting this MBE for the work I've been doing,' she said. 'It's amazing to have but it's not just for me - it's for all those other women. 'Especially because of Covid, there's been such an epidemic of domestic violence, that's been completely on the rise, and you know I've got an army of women behind me that need help and need to be heard. 'So I'm their voice because we've all been through exactly the same story, so I don't take it as it's my award because it's our award because we've survived.'  Mel split from husband Stephen Belafonte in 2017 after 10 years of marriage. The singer claimed he had been emotionally and physically abusive during that time. Stephen has always vehemently denied all allegations made against him. Mel recently said she is still suffering with the trauma from her previous marriage and has terrible flashbacks that leave her drenched in 'shame, sweat and fear'.

'Was that Will Smith?' Chris commented as he put his arm around his fellow comic after the attack, video showed. Chris - who performed a set earlier in the night - was infamously slapped onstage by Will Smith after joking about Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head during the Oscars in March. Following this, the former Fresh Prince star was banned from the ceremony for the next 10 years. A shaken Dave Chappelle still tried to entertain after the frightening incident, including suggesting that the assailant was a 'trans man,' ABC News noted (the comedian received backlash for comments about transgender people in a Netflix special last year).

    "b919897808b5d52c3dae7fe01019d017f699c5bc9297d65d0f7da741": "New analysis suggests around nine in 10 people in England have caught Covid at least once in the last two years. Now that England is operating under the government's 'Living With Covid' strategy, the lockdowns we experienced towards the start of the pandemic seem like a long time ago. But the virus is still very much with us as proven by these new estimates from The Financial Times, even if it is now significantly less deadly for most vaccinated people. Journalist John Burn-Murdoch explained that he believes nine out of 10 people in England have tested positive for Covid at some point in the pandemic based on the Office of National Statistics (ONS) data available leading up to mid-April. He tweeted: 'The range is based on the cumulative series ONS published on April 22, but extending it forward to late April based on latest weekly ONS prevalence numbers.' This claim does line up with the previous ONS suggestion that more than nine in 10 people in England now have antibodies against the virus, although a fair portion of these will stem from vaccinations rather than from catching Covid. Yet Burn-Murdoch's suggestion is a large jump up from the seven in 10 people in England the ONS estimated had Covid between 27 April 2020 and 11 February 2022, in research published in April. The ONS had the most detailed analysis to date at the time with 71% in England testing positive - this works out to a staggering 38.5 million people. However, this data was disrupted by the Omicron wave which swept across the country in winter. The new Covid strain triggered the highest prevalence of positive cases compared to any previous period of the pandemic, meaning even when the ONS data was published, it was expected to be an underestimate. All legal restrictions in England were also lifted at the end of February, meaning Covid was able to spread even further. 'The total number of infected people was rising rapidly when the data stopped,' Professor James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, explained. 'The bottom line is the majority of people in the UK have had Covid.' ONS found this stat by using data from the 535,116 people who took part in the coronavirus infection survey in England. The infection rate was slightly lower in Wales, where the ONS estimated 56% of the population had tested positive, although this was based on data only collected from June 2020 onwards. In Scotland, the rate was even lower at 52%, but again, data was only collected from September 2020.  For comparison, in Northern Ireland, 72% of the population were predicted to have been infected between 27 July 2020 and 11 February 2022. The new findings from the Financial Times come as Covid rates are falling in the UK. There have been just 79,310 positive tests in the last seven days - a drop of almost 40% - after peaking in March to the highest number of positive cases seen in the UK since the first lockdown. However, there's been a decrease in the number of tests conducted as well, by 18% compared to the previous week. Yet, after a brief spike, deaths within 28 days of a positive test have dropped as well, as has the number of patients admitted to hospital. According to the Gov.uk official data, 22 million people have tested positive for Covid during the course of the pandemic across the UK. More than 18.5 million of these cases came from England.",
    "9ec1c40b6a1a5ceea9face7f106dfd771d8d2a93797aa30a89180c21": "Voters across the UK will go to the polls on Thursday, with both Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer hoping for a boost ahead of the next general election. Where are the elections? A total of 200 local authorities across Britain are holding elections. More than 6,800 seats are up for grabs. Every council seat in Scotland, Wales and London is up for election and there are polls across much of the rest of England. In Northern Ireland voters are electing members of the Stormont Assembly, with 90 members due to be chosen across 18 constituencies. What does it mean for Boris Johnson? Local elections are always seen as verdicts on national party leaders, even if they are notionally about grassroots issues such as when the bins are collected. At the last set of local elections in May 2021, the Tories, aided by the so-called vaccine bounce, gained 235 seats and took control of 13 councils. But this year's elections are taking place in a much different political climate. And the party could be looking at losing between 250-350 seats.  While that number is perhaps relatively small for a mid-term government, if the losses come in the traditional Tory Home County shires, where the Lib Dems are hoping to make inroads, it will unsettle many Conservative MPs and sap their morale.  If the losses reach towards 500 seats, then the prime minister will be seen to have had a disastrous night. It will be Johnson's first major nationwide electoral test since the partygate scandal broke and he was fined by police for breaching his own lockdown laws. Voters are also casting their ballots just as the impact of rising energy prices and increased taxes have begun to bite. The prime minister's position as Tory leader has stabilised since the revelations about parties in Downing Street were first reported. Johnson's allies, with some success, argued it would be wrong to change leader while the war in Ukraine was ongoing.  The absence of an obvious successor - Rishi Sunak has had a dramatic fall from grace - also helped the prime minister see-off a challenge. But many Conservative MPs were said to be waiting to see how the party performed at the elections before deciding whether to call for him to go. Johnson's main strength within his party is that he is seen as an election winner, possessing an almost magic ability to connect with voters.  Tory MPs will be watching carefully to see if it looks like he has run out of tricks. What about Keir Starmer? The elections are arguably as crucial a test for Keir Stamer as the PM, giving clues as to whether he is on course to lead Labour to victory at the next general election, due in 2024. Since succeeding Jeremy Corbyn in 2019, Starmer has hauled the party towards the centre. And he has been able to point to an improvement in the party's poll ratings as evidence his strategy is working. Labour had been ahead for months and the latest YouGov survey put the party on 39%, six pints clear of the Tories on 33%. But the elections in England are largely in places which last went to the polls in 2018 in the wake of Labour's unexpected surge at the 2017 general election. The party performed well, achieving its best showing at local elections since 2012. This means Labour is starting from a high bar and could find it hard to make dramatic across-the-board gains. A good night for the party would be to pick up 100-150 seats. But crucially, Starmer will want to show Labour under his leadership has breadth as well as depth. He will be looking to secure victories across England outside of Labour's London stronghold, and make some progress in Scotland. For the left of the party, many of whom are angry at the party's rightward shift and unconvinced by Starmer's personal appeal with voters, an underwhelming set of results will be seized upon as proof the party is heading for another general election defeat. Timetable of results Thursday 10pm: Polls close. Friday May 6, from 12am: First results expected. Labour is hoping to do well in Conservative-run Bolton in Greater Manchester. The Tories could make gains in Basildon in Essex. Results from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, South Tyneside and Wigan will indicate if Labour's vote is holding up in its northern strongholds. From 2am: Sunderland has been run by Labour since 1973 but the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are hoping to make enough gains to leave the council in no overall control. Both Labour and the Tories are battling for control of Hartlepool and Peterborough. Stevenage in Hertfordshire could show if Labour is making gains in commuter territory. From 3am: First key results from London. Westminster is a Labour longshot and has been run by the Conservatives continuously since 1964. In both Hammersmith & Fulham and Redbridge the Tories are fighting to hold on to a dwindling number of councillors. Elsewhere Hull is a two-way fight between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. From 4am: Two crucial results are due from the West Midlands. The Conservatives are defending a slim majority in Dudley and a larger one in Nuneaton & Bedworth; Labour hopes to make progress on both councils. Hillingdon is another Labour longshot in London and contains within its boundary the constituency of Boris Johnson. From 5am: Labour is hoping to retake Southampton from Conservative control and make gains in Derby. The Conservatives are defending Wandsworth in London which they have held since 1978. By 7am: The final result is due from Conservative-run Barnet, Labour's top target in London. All outstanding overnight results are also due. Around 9am: Counting begins for a further 71 councils in England and all councils in Scotland and Wales. From 12pm: Results likely to resume in England. The Green party is hoping to make gains in Conservative-controlled Solihull. Labour is hoping to do likewise in Tory-run Walsall. First results are also due from Scotland and for the mayoral elections in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham and Watford. From 2pm: Two key councils in West Sussex are due to declare: Worthing, a top Labour target; and Crawley, where both the Tories and Labour are hoping to gain control. The Liberal Democrats could make gains in West Oxfordshire. East Renfrewshire is a three-way battle between the Conservatives, Labour and the SNP. First results are due from Wales. From 3pm: Another key Conservative-Labour battleground, Newcastle-under-Lyme in Staffordshire, is due to finish counting. In Wales, Labour is looking to take control of Blaenau Gwent from a group of Independents, while Flintshire is a test of Tory popularity in an area in which they did well at the 2019 general election. Aberdeenshire will be a measure of Conservative support in Scotland, while all parties hope to pick up seats in Edinburgh. From 4pm: The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are fighting for control of the new unitary authority in Somerset. In Glasgow, the SNP is looking to hold off any sign of a Labour resurgence. The Lib Dems hope to strengthen control of St Albans and the Tories want to keep control of Pendle in Lancashire. The result of the South Yorkshire mayoral election is also due. From 5pm: The Lib Dems hope to cause an upset in Tory-run Gosport in Hampshire. Labour is defending a slim majority in Cardiff. The result in Labour-run Wakefield could offer clues to the outcome of the expected parliamentary by-election in the city later this year, after Conservative MP Imran Khan was convicted of sexual assault. Tower Hamlets in London is due to declare the result of its mayoral election. Renfrewshire is the last result due from Scotland. Friday evening: North Hertfordshire could see both Labour and the Lib Dems gaining from the Conservatives. Labour is hoping to improve its majority in Bury in Greater Manchester. Vale of Glamorgan is the final result due from Wales. In London, the Croydon mayoral result is expected. Saturday May 7, around 9am: Counting continues for the council election in Tower Hamlets in London. Around 5pm: Final result due from Tower Hamlets.",
    "c4d11f6506f0454a9dc3fcd74acb380da4ccee771e3a773f0206eb85": "A former Conservative councillor has called on voters to back Labour in tomorrow's local elections. The dramatic intervention by Barry Macleod-Cullinane, who served as deputy leader of Harrow Council when the Tories were last in power there, said the prime minister was 'destroying' his party. In a letter, he called on residents to vote Labour to 'send Boris Johnson a message'. Macleod-Cullinane said: 'We now know that Boris Johnson broke the law and has lied repeatedly to Parliament and to us. 'He's taking us for fools - and we can't let him get away with it. A vote for Boris Johnson's Conservatives on Thursday 5th May will be a vote for his chaotic leadership. We deserve better. That's why I'll be voting Labour on Thursday 5th May.' Other former Conservative councillors are telling voters to back the Liberal Democrats in tomorrow's elections.  Meanwhile, HuffPost UK can reveal that Conservative associations have shunned visits from cabinet ministers as campaigners warn that brand Boris is 'shattered'. Candidates have also put disclaimers on their leaflets pleading with the public not to 'punish' them for 'mistakes made in Westminster'. Staff in Conservative campaign headquarters [CCHQ] are braced for the fallout, with one survey even putting the Tories on track to lose nearly 550 seats amid the backlash over partygate and the government's response to the cost of living crisis. HuffPost UK has spoken to Tory candidates who say they have been reluctant to allow government ministers to visit their wards due to 'toxic' Westminster politics.  Sources said a number of London associations did not want any CCHQ involvement in their local campaigns. 'I know associations have turned down cabinet member visits,' one Tory campaigner said. After Conservative chairman Oliver Dowden recently visited Wales, a council candidate said: 'A lot of people didn't want him coming here because they have been told everything needs to be local.' In Elmbridge, Surrey, a former Conservative councillor wrote to residents urging them to vote for the Lib Dems in two key wards. Councillor Alan Kopitko wrote: 'You only have to look nationally with the lies that Boris and his followers have portrayed denying parties that they engaged in during lockdown echoing themselves whilst the Covid infection was spreading, and people were dying. This is detrimental to our democracy, whatever your political affiliations.' Tory candidates have been marketing themselves as 'Local Conservatives' with hundreds listed under the label on the ballot paper for the first time. They have also been leaving the prime minister off their leaflets.  Others have been more blatant in their bid to distance themselves from the national party, with Hartlepool candidates writing on their pamphlets: 'This Thursday, please don't punish local Conservatives for the mistakes made in Westminster, we are local and proud of where we live, and like you, we want the best for Hartlepool.' Senior Tory MPs including ministers and deputy prime minister Dominic Raab have also recently adopted green branding for their constituency material. The picture varies from the so-called Red Wall region in the north to the south and London - where campaigners say Boris Johnson is proving a problem.  A Tory campaigning in London said: 'Things aren't great really for the Conservative Party. Partygate is still coming up, it's really shattered trust in the government and Boris. 'People are now linking it to other things, for example the government doesn't understand the cost of living because they are so out of touch. That comes up quite a lot. 'The Boris brand is completely shattered, a lot of people are saying things like 'I don't trust him, I thought he'd be different, I thought he'd be on our side, I thought he'd be funny'. 'None of that exists any more. There's still a lot of anger. Ukraine is coming up a little bit, cost of living is probably the main thing and that personal trust in the government is coming up a lot.' However, seasoned observers are less worried because they say the last time the elections were held the Conservatives did badly and Labour did well so the results might therefore mask the true level of discontent.  They hope by the time the next general election comes round that the government has improved its position and standing. It is also quite usual that non-governing parties do well at local elections and some Tories on the doorsteps say that national issues are not being raised at all.  One Red Wall Tory MP said partygate had proved 'a bit of an issue' on the doorstep but that only around 10 per cent of Tories were bringing it up. They added: 'I'm not detecting people going back to Labour in any numbers at all, it will all come down to turnout in terms of what result we get this week.' Another Red Wall Conservative MP on the campaign trail remained fiercely optimistic, saying: 'It's all to play for in last couple of days, we're very close to winning in a few traditionally Labour areas.' Some of the main areas to watch include Tory flagship councils Wandsworth and Westminster, as well as Barnet, Southampton, Newcastle-under-Lyme and Thurrock. The results could fuel speculation over Johnson's leadership, with some MPs already seeing the election as a referendum on the prime minister. HuffPost UK has heard that staff working for some leadership hopefuls have been trying to 'tap-up' MPs for support for weeks. One MP has also admitted they are a campaign manager-in-waiting for one hopeful.  Some MPs think any leadership challenge must take place in a 'window of opportunity' soon after Thursday's results are announced or Johnson will likely be taking them into the next general election.  However, it all depends on whether enough letters of no confidence have been submitted to chairman of the 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady.

Neil Parish's resignation came just 24 hours after his former Tory colleague, Imran Ahmad Khan, stood down in the wake of his conviction for sexually assaulting a teenage boy. Parish, who had been the MP for Tiverton and Honiton since 2010, lost the Tory whip last Friday but had initially said he intended to remain as an MP while the allegations against him were investigated. But he announced he would be standing down the following day after admitting watching adult material in parliament, claiming the first time was accidental as he searched for tractors online. It means a by-election will be held in his seat - which Parish retained for the Tories at the last election with a majority of 24,239 - later this year.  Under arcane parliamentary rules, MPs cannot directly resign their seat during a parliament and so have to apply for a paid office of the Crown.   As a result, the Treasury today announced that Parish has been appointed Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead. Speaking to the BBC on Saturday, the 65-year-old former farmer said: 'The situation was, funnily enough it was tractors I was looking at, so I did get into another website with sort of a very similar name and I watched it for a bit, which I shouldn't have done. 'My crime, my most biggest crime, is that on another occasion I went in a second time, and that was deliberate. That was sitting waiting to vote on the side of the chamber.'  In a statement, his local Conservative association in Tiverton and Honiton, Devon, said: 'We would like to take this opportunity to thank Neil Parish for his service to our communities over the past 12 years.   'We support his decision to step down as our Member of Parliament.'  ",

The prime minister's sit-down with Susanna Reid on Tuesday made headlines for a number of reasons, one of which came after the presenter introduced Lorraine, who hosts the show directly after GMB.  'Who's Lorraine?' Johnson asked. The moment drew a response from former Good Morning Britain presenter Piers, who slammed the PM over his performance in the interview.  Trailing his TalkTV show Piers Morgan Uncensored in a chat with the channel's Tom Newton-Dunn, Piers said: 'We all know Lorraine Kelly. I think he knows Lorraine Kelly, he just didn't know what on earth was going on in that whole interview.' He continued: 'I thought Susanna skewered him beautifully and he just lost his way and lost his mind, as he does so often.  'The trouble is he can probably survive partygate to a degree, maybe even survive surging inflation. He can't survive insulting Lorraine Kelly - it's over. It's over for him.' Piers, who left GMB last March after calling into question Meghan Markle's claims that she'd experienced suicidal thoughts during her time as a senior royal, said it was 'good to see' Johnson back on the ITV programme.  'Only took him five years and he waited until I'd left,' he noted.  Piers also praised his former co-host Susanna on Twitter, following her interview, which saw the PM come under fire for how he dealt with a question about 77-year-old Elsie, who rides the bus all day as she can't afford to heat her home.  'Boris will be heading back to the fridge after that,' Piers tweeted, referring to how Johnson infamously hid in a fridge to avoid questions from GMB in the run up to the 2019 election. 'Well done @susannareid100 - the Elsie line of attack was lethally effective in exposing his Government's failure to properly help our most vulnerable people amid soaring inflation.' Piers Morgan Uncensored airs weeknights at 8pm on TalkTV and on YouTube. ",

The impact of rising energy costs and the war in Ukraine continue to trickle into retail prices, according to the BRC-NielsenIQ Shop Price Index. And it doesn't look like these prices will decrease soon.  Shop price annual inflation accelerated to 2.7% in April, up from 2.1% in March and soaring beyond the 12 and six-month average increases of 0.4% and 1.5%, according to the index. In April, food inflation accelerated to 3.5%, which was an increase from 3.3% in March, although fresh food inflation slowed slightly from 3.5% last month to 3.4% in April amid fierce competition between supermarkets which resisted price hikes on everyday essentials. 'Retailers will continue to do all they can to keep prices down and deliver value for their customers by limiting price rises and expanding their value ranges,' said British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson. 'But this will put pressure on them to find cost-savings elsewhere. Unfortunately, customers should brace themselves for further price rises and a bumpy road ahead.' Sadly, we're going to see an increase on more products outside of gas, food and electricity. These include:  1. Greetings cards2. Books3. Furniture4. Electrical goods 5. Stationery 6. Non-alcoholic drinks The cost of raw materials is rising for books, greeting cards and stationery. Vicky Ellis, sales director at Clays, which prints 150 million books per year, told the Times raw material prices for things like paper have risen by an average of 39%.  The Card Factory also recently revealed prices have gone up for its greetings cards as inflation hits. The company said inflationary pressures have seen card prices already rising and higher price points are expected to last throughout the year.  'As previously guided in January, the board expects significant inflationary headwinds to continue through (the current financial year),' The Card Factory said.  And according to the British Retail Consortium, furniture, electricals and books have seen the highest rate of inflation since records began in 2006, accelerating to 2.2% in April from 1.5% in March. Prices have been exacerbated by disruption at the world's largest seaport, following Shanghai's recent lockdown.  'For the 'durable' goods category, books, stationary and home entertainment saw the biggest increases on the month - but the inflation here was predominantly driven by surging prices for books,' senior communications executive at British Retail Consortium Lara Conradie tells HuffPost.  'Furniture and flooring also saw notable price increases.' Among non-fresh foods, Conradie says April price increases have 'particularly emerged from non-alcoholic beverages'. Other food products showing the fastest rates of price growth are oils and fats, dairy products and more recently, vegetables. 'Inflation shows no signs of abating,' adds Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at NielsenIQ. 'The increase in non-food prices is an extra challenge for the high street as fragile consumer confidence and rising living costs are likely to negatively affect consumer spending.' ",
    "1aec08912e15e6a27307794e1e4141b161e16377986fa25cf6af63e6": "George Eustice suggested this morning that buying 'value brands' from supermarkets would help everyone cope with the cost of living crisis - and people are furious. The environment, food and rural affairs secretary told Sky News on Wednesday: 'Generally speaking, what people find is by going for some sort of value brand rather than own branded products they can actually contain and manage their household budget.' This sparked significant backlash, especially considering more than one in five people in the UK are in poverty according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The government has also exacerbated the crisis by increasing national insurance contributions at the beginning of April, while energy bills started soaring after energy regulator Ofgem lifted the price cap. These higher costs are now being passed onto the consumer, meaning grocery bills are climbing too. More and more people are subsequently turning to food banks as they choose between eating and heating. Yet, the government seems to be doing little to help. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's spring statement was heavily criticised for not acting on the crisis when it was first unveiled in March. And to make matters worse, prime minister Boris Johnson used a very bizarre defence to explain away Downing Street's inaction on ITV's Good Morning Britain this week. When told about a pensioner who has to ride the bus all day just to stay warm because she can't afford her energy bills, the prime minister replied by saying had actually championed the 24-hour freedom bus pass. Eustice's comments about saving money on Sky News this morning therefore followed a wave of embarrassing government missteps when it comes to handling the cost of living crisis. Here's a roundup of the best Twitter reactions to the cabinet minister's suggestion so far:",

On Monday, a controversial leaked draft document - published by the news site Politico - appeared to suggest the majority of US Supreme Court justices would vote to overturn Roe Vs Wade - the historic case law that legalised abortion across America.  If the law is overturned, 26 out of 50 US states are expected to ban abortion.  The news sent shockwaves around the world, with women stepping forward to share their abortion stories. Lizzi Green, a priest based in St Albans, was among them.  In a Twitter thread that's been liked more than 13,000 times, Green shares that she had two abortions. The first was after she was raped and the second was due to the fact that her pregnancy was endangering her life.  Although most pro-choice advocates would argue that a woman should not need to justify her reasons for seeking a termination, Green's thread does highlight some of the many reasons women may seek an abortion.  'Abortion saves lives,' she writes. 'But I've come to the conclusion that actually, people know this. You know the astonishing complexity of pregnancy, you know people get coerced, you know people are simply too poor to cope, you know all the myriad reasons someone might need safe access to abortion. The sickening thing is, you just don't care.' Hundreds of people have commented to thank Green for sharing her story, though anti-abortion campaigners have also quote tweeted the thread with strong rebuttals and, in some cases, hateful abuse.  'To those who have been kind, from both 'sides' of the debate, thank you,' Green said in a further tweet. 'To those who have told me to die, to piss off (that was the polite one), that I'm a baby murdering heretic, [I] hope you find happiness, security and compassion soon.' Elsewhere on Twitter, others have been sharing personal stories supporting the sentiment that 'abortion saves lives'. In one thread that's been shared more than 200,000 times, a woman tells the story of her 16-year-old sister and her boyfriend, who ended their own lives because they did not have access to abortion.  Celebrities have also shared their own personal abortion stories. Singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers has been widely praised for de-stigmatising the issue after sharing an Instagram story about her experience.  As many have pointed out as the situation in the US develops: you can't ban abortion, you can only ban safe access to abortion. ",
    "cc2ad8ecb80165e6c9589a577ec55747bf37d564383f4c68b94cfa96": "Susanna Reid has reacted to her headline-making interview with Boris Johnson, perfectly laying out how he should have dealt with one of her questions.  The prime minister's first sit-down on Good Morning Britain in five years sparked reaction in the press and on social media after Susanna told him about 77-year-old viewer Elsie, who rides the bus all day because she can't afford to heat her home.  Inexplicably, the prime minister attempted to make a virtue of her predicament by insisting - wrongly, as it turns out - that she could only do this because he had introduced the freedom pass for pensioners when he was mayor of London. Discussing the reaction to the interview with co-host Richard Madeley on Wednesday's show, Susanna said: 'I think in those situations when you are challenged by an individual case - rather than claiming credit for the fact she can travel on the bus in order not to have to switch on her heating, lighting, even kettle or television at home - I think leaders should say, 'That sounds desperate. I do not want to be in a country where someone like Elsie feels like she has to do that. Let me find out about that case, let me find out about Elsie, let me talk to her and we will see what help we can get her.' 'That seems, to me, the more human response to that sort of story,' she said.  Richard was interested to know what the PM 'was like', to which Susanna said: 'It was interesting, because when I was researching for the interview I went back over a huge number of interviews that Boris Johnson has done, obviously, and also over a lot of the coverage that we've done on Good Morning Britain.  'We have so often interviewed commentators, experts, viewers about the prime minister. There've been so many moments where people have said, 'oh my goodness, after that gaffe he's got to go'. When he was foreign secretary he would make blunders, when he's been many other positions, but he is Teflon Boris. He's someone who survives.' Following the PM's interview on the ITV breakfast show, the independent FullFact website fact-checked the answers he gave, and found him wanting on the topic of the 24-hour freedom bus pass, as well as economic growth and council tax.  Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV. ",
    "9218c5f82e97ea7e279ce950d00a159e84646e35eee91dfda0cb152d": "Nadine Dorries took aim at Keir Starmer on Twitter last night, and suggested the only way to become prime minister was to be 'honest' - a point which could be seen as a little on the nose. The culture secretary is known for her vocal support for the current prime minister Boris Johnson, especially when he has come under fire from his critics for not necessarily telling the whole truth throughout his time in office. She backed him even when he was recently accused of misleading parliament over his attendance at the Downing Street lockdown parties, and said in February she would only stop being loyal to Johnson if he 'kicked a dog'. So, when she tried to attack the leader of the opposition by calling for him to be 'open, honest and transparent', it's fair to say it raised some eyebrows. Responding to the Daily Mail's front page which accused Starmer of dodging questions about attending a gathering with beer during lockdown, Dorries tweeted: 'The man who wants to one day be prime minister cannot behave like this. 'He has a responsibility to be open, honest and transparent with the public. #Beergate' 'Beergate' is the new term to describe the party which Starmer has been accused of attending in April 2021 in Durham. He remains adamant that he did not break any social distancing rules at the time. Even so, the Tories have repeatedly called for a probe into this gathering following the mounting number of fines being issued to their own party over breaking Covid rules - including fixed penalty notices for both Johnson himself, his wife Carrie Johnson and his chancellor Rishi Sunak. While the Metropolitan Police are still investigating the government's own involvement in a series of Downing Street parties - dubbed partygate - Durham Police have not got back in touch with Starmer about his attendance at this gathering. Hours before Dorries' tweet, new data from YouGov shows the flurry of renewed interest in Beergate had not actually affected what the public think of Starmer or Johnson. In fact, when compared to the same survey questions asked in January, an extra 2% of respondents like Starmer generally did follow the rules (making it a 42% overall). When asked the same question about the prime minister, 70% still believed Johnson had 'generally' broken the Covid rules.",

As a child, Kailia was among the young stars of the reality series Toddlers & Tiaras, which followed a group of girls as they prepared to compete in child pageants. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Kailia's mother Marcy Posey Gatterman announced the devastating news that the teenager had died just a week after celebrating her 16th birthday. 'I don't have words or any thoughts. A beautiful baby girl is gone,' she wrote on her Facebook page. 'Please give us privacy as we mourn the loss of Kailia. My baby forever.' No cause of death was given in Marcy's Facebook post, though a statement from Kailia's family to TMZ said that she had 'made the rash decision to end her earthly life'. In her memory, Kailia's family has set up a fund with the Whatcom Community Foundation aiming to 'help get much needed resources to students in crisis'. Kailia appeared in 26 episodes of Toddlers & Tiaras - which aired on TLC in the US - in 2011, when she was five years old. Those who have never seen Toddlers & Tiaras may still be familiar with Kailia, as a gif from the show showing her grinning mischievously at the camera continues to be popular on social media. According to her IMDB page, Kailia had recently branched out into acting, playing a demonic character in the Netflix horror film Eli in 2019. Sky News reported that she had also maintained her interests in pageantry, including competing in Miss Washington Teen USA earlier this year.

The stand-up star was performing at the venue on Tuesday night as part of the Netflix Is A Joke festival when someone rushed the stage and launched himself at the comic during his set. Actor Jamie Foxx helped apprehend the alleged attacker who was subsequently dragged off stage by security personnel before the performance continued, according to US reports.  'Whenever you're in trouble, Jamie Foxx will show up in a sheriff's hat,' Chappelle said at the show's curtain call. Los Angeles police told local station KABC that they responded to an incident at the venue at around 10:45 p.m. A man who was reportedly armed with a gun and a knife was taken into custody. In another video of the aftermath of the incident, Chappelle can be heard joking that 'It was a trans man.' UK journalist Sharon Carpenter, who was at the show, shared her account on social media. 'Dave Chappelle was just assaulted on stage at his Hollywood Bowl show,' she said. 'He was finishing up his performance when a man ran on-stage and lunged at him knocking him to the floor. Security and his entourage then cornered the man as Dave joked about him getting 'stomped' backstage.' BuzzFeed News reporter Brianna Sacks said Los Angeles police and fire department personnel loaded the man into an ambulance outside the venue. A crowd can be heard booing the alleged attacker as he is carried into the back of the ambulance in another clip shared on Twitter. British comic Jimmy Carr, who sparked outrage earlier this year for making a joke about the Holocaust in his own Netflix stand-up special, also performed at the streaming giant's event on Tuesday. He tweeted afterwards to say the show was 'crazy' and he was 'just happy everyone's OK'. A spokeswoman for the Hollywood Bowl said an investigation has been launched, telling the PA news agency: 'The incident that occurred at the Hollywood Bowl on May 3 2022 is an active investigation and we are unable to comment further at this time.' Chappelle has previously faced a backlash over comments about transgender people in his Netflix comedy special, The Closer. The comic said 'gender is a fact' and shared his backing for JK Rowling, who has also attracted criticism for her remarks about the concept of biological sex. Netflix employees were said to have reacted with anger to his comments and reportedly organised a walkout over the streaming giant's decision to air the special. The incident follows Will Smith slapping Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars over a joke the comic made about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. It prompted members of the comedy community, including Jack Whitehall and Kathy Griffin, to voice their concerns that performers are no longer safe on stage.",

The journalist clashed with environment secretary George Eustice during an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The exchange grew particularly terse when Robinson asked him about standards in parliament and the Partygate scandal.  Eustice tried to steer the conversation away from the Conservative Party by raising allegations that Labour leader Keir Starmer had a lockdown beer and curry party. But the veteran broadcaster refused to be diverted.  Robinson also asked the cabinet minister about Tory MP Neil Parish who quit after he was accused of watching porn in the Commons chamber. The BBC journalist said: 'You are a farmer, there's a family farm. Have you ever stumbled across porn when looking for a tractor?' Eustice replied 'no' and added: 'Look Neil Parish, somebody I know and respect, has given an account and he's resigned his seat for what happened. 'Clearly it was a big error of judgement what he did and I think he's given an account of that...' Eustice told Robinson his question was 'flippant' before the broadcaster pressed him: 'Do you not think that some of the things that are now being said to excuse and defend behaviour that in any other walk of life would persuade people to resign, if not to abjectly apologise whether it's porn or parties, there is a danger that you are insulting people's intelligence?' The cabinet minister said Boris Johnson had paid his fixed penalty notice after a cake was brought into the cabinet room, adding: 'He's paid that fine...he's apologised for that and we've seen allegations today about Keir Starmer attending a party...' When Robinson interrupted him to say he was asking him about the Conservative Party, Eustice told him: 'You're asking a question about politics, Nick, and in the interest of balance you need to recognise that the leader of opposition is facing...' Robinson hit back: 'I don't need any lectures from you about balance Mr Eustice, we interviewed Sir Keir all about it yesterday.' The journalist later signed off the interview pointing out how every other major political party had put up their leader for an interview on the programme - except the Conservative Party.",

The veteran presenter, who has announced she is stepping down as host of the long-running Channel 4 show after just one year, described press reports that she doesn't get on with Rachel as 'nonsense' but admitted they're not especially close. 'I'm not saying I would go on holiday with Rachel Riley, but she is brilliant,' Anne told the Daily Mail.  'Absolutely honestly, I do admire her - she is really, really good at what she does, as is Susie Dent.' 'Look, Rachel has just come back from having a baby and she is standing throughout and faultless, whereas I get to sit down,' she continued. 'She is noisy, yes she and Susie both are - they are a formidable pair those two. But there isn't a question of my going because of a rift, that's nonsense.' Anne went on to explain that she has had little opportunity to get to know Rachel and wordsmith Susie because there simply isn't time. 'The way that it's filmed is so tight that... we don't have time to talk to each other,' Anne explained. 'We shoot for an hour for a 45-minute show, it's a well-oiled machine.  'Between shows we have a 10-minute turn-around to get changed. We can go for almost a whole run without doing more than waving to each other from the end of a corridor.' Rachel has previously admitted that Anne was 'not the cuddliest person in the world' amid reports of behind-the-scenes feuding, but played down rumours of any on-set tension. 'It's just a different show now, she's making it her own,' Rachel said last year. 'She's getting some stuff out of the contestants - sometimes it's barbed, sometimes it's funny, it's just got a different flavour.' Anne joined the long-running letters and numbers quiz show last year, becoming its sixth presenter and the first woman to take on presenting duties. She took over from The Apprentice's Nick Hewer following his 10 year run at the helm. Anne, who has fronted 265 episodes, revealed she had already 'stayed longer than I signed up for.'

George Eustice said that by going for cheaper 'value' goods, families can 'contain and manage their household budget'. The environment secretary said household spending on food in the UK was 'the lowest in Europe' but sharp rises in other costs 'adds to household pressures'. He made the comments after shop prices increased at their fastest rate in more than a decade last month, according to the British Retail Consortium. Asked what his advice was to people who want a Sunday roast with a chicken but cannot afford it, Eustice told Sky News: 'Generally speaking, what people find is by going for some of the value brands rather than own-branded products - they can actually contain and manage their household budget. 'It will undoubtedly put a pressure on household budgets and, of course, it comes on top of those high gas prices as well.' The comments were condemned and ridiculed by opposition MPs as well as members of the public.  Lib Dem Wendy Chamberlain MP said: 'These comments show George Eustice and the Conservatives are living in a parallel universe. Families and pensioners who can't afford their weekly shop need more help, not patronising advice from a clueless minister.' Eustice said rising fertiliser and feed costs had hit the farming industry, partly as a result of soaring energy prices. He said the better news was that the UK has a 'very competitive' retail market with 10 big supermarkets and the four main ones competing 'very aggressively'. He said this meant they competed to keep costs down on everyday value items such as spaghetti.  Eustice added: 'Where it gets harder is on things like chicken and poultry, and some fresh produce, where those increased feed costs do end up getting passed through the system because these people work on wafer-thin margins and they have to pass that cost through.' He was also asked about 77-year-old Elsie who rides on buses all day to keep down her bills at home. Her case was raised with the prime minister on Tuesday. Eustice added: 'Well, my advice would be that, you know, not to stay on a on a bus all day to try and stay warm. My advice would be to seek some support from the local authority.' Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has said the government should come up with an emergency budget to help families get through the cost of living crisis. She told BBC Breakfast: 'People are really, really worried. They started to feel it for the first time in the last few weeks, when people got their gas and electricity bills in April.'   Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer stepped up his call for a windfall tax on the unexpectedly high profits made by oil and gas giants. However, Eustice insisted that oil and gas companies already paid enough tax 'for now' and rejected calls for a levy on their windfall profits.   It comes as fresh figures showed shop prices are up 2.7 per cent on last year marking their highest rate of inflation since September 2011. The impact of rising energy prices and the conflict in Ukraine continued to feed through into April's retail prices, with no sign of them abating, according to the BRC-NielsenIQ Shop Price Index. Global food prices have also reached record highs, seeing a 13 per cent rise on last month alone. It is even higher for cooking oils and cereals amid warnings that they will place further upward pressure on UK food prices as they filter through the supply chain over coming months. Non-food products, particularly furniture, electricals and books, have seen the highest rate of inflation since records began in 2006. British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said: 'Retailers will continue to do all they can to keep prices down and deliver value for their customers by limiting price rises and expanding their value ranges, but this will put pressure on them to find cost-savings elsewhere.

'It's what life is about for me - raising the next generation,' she said. 'The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. 'We're so excited to be expanding the family.

During the same interview, Sophie also spoke about how becoming parents led her to reassess her relationship with fame, stating they are 'very protective' of their private life. 'You never want to market yourself as a celebrity couple. It's not that cool,' she insisted. 'And my daughter never asked for any of this. 'I know what it can do to your mental health to be in this industry, and to be photographed every day and have the comments.

Here's her outfit from the 2016 Gala: And here's another number from 2017: Her 2018 dress seems to compliment the patterns on the red carpet: And her 2022 Met Gala gown seemed to follow the same theme:  If the coordination is intentional, it's unclear how Blake could pull it off -- though she was a co-host at the 2022 event, which may explain her getting some intel. According to a piece in Curbed about the history of the gala's literal red carpet, more work goes into its design than one would think.  Phillip Bland, a decorative artist on Long Island who came into the job seven years ago after working with Anna Wintour on her various homes, is responsible for painting it. And although he's one of the first people to know the gala's theme each year, he implied that most celebrities are unaware of his final design. 'My hope is when the final design comes out, it doesn't clash too much,' the designer says of the stars walking the carpet.  'If someone spent all this money on this beautiful dress and all of a sudden they get out there -- I'm sure they don't know what the carpet is gonna look like.' Mm-hmm, sure. So we're starting a new internet theory -- that Blake's got Phillip's number in her contacts.",

In the heavy throes of new motherhood, exercise is likely to be the last thing on your mind. And - it must be stressed - that is absolutely okay. We're not here for any of that 'get your body back' nonsense.  But there may come a point when you start thinking about getting active, especially if a regular fitness routine was something you enjoyed before becoming a parent. So this week, we've got a five-minute workout from Rosie Stockley, the women's fitness specialist who has trained the likes of Vogue Williams, Lauren Pope and Binky Felstead during and after their pregnancies. Most recently she's launched The Mamawell Method - a bespoke workout programme for pre- and post-natal women.  'Once you feel ready to move a bit, exercise can be so energising for new mums. There are so many benefits both for mental and physical health,' she says. 'Having a new baby is very intense, tiring, consuming - exercise can give a real boost of energy, help to strengthen and bring a lot of confidence - plus it's a great time just for you.  'The body has made a few adaptations through pregnancy and childbirth, so this needs to be respected with your exercise choice. Building up intensity gradually on the pelvic floor and abdominals is important to avoid possible setbacks down the line.'   Below, Stockley has shared a step-by-step five-minute, postpartum workout - just remember to get the thumbs up at your six-week check before doing anything strenuous.  1. Glute bridges Lie flat on your back with a neutral spine (don't press your back into the mat) and place your arms by your side. Take a full inhale. On the exhale lift your hips up to the ceiling and hold in this position for a couple of seconds before lowering. Don't arch your back in the hip raise but focus on keeping it really straight with your glutes activated. Repeat 10 times.  2. Single leg marches Come into your glute bridge position, but place your hands on your hips so you have the support of your elbows on the floor. Focusing on keeping your hips steady, lift one leg off and bring your knee towards your chest, then replace the foot gently. Repeat with the other leg then do two more before lowering your hips and repeating. Aim to keep your hips high and level whilst performing this move, and don't hold your breath! 3. Bird dog (elbow to knee in four point kneeling) Use this movement in the earlier postpartum days to build up strength before taking your leg off the floor.  Start on all fours, hands under shoulder, knees under hips. Find a little activation in your abdomen and then stretch your arm and leg long while taking a full inhale. On the exhale bring the elbow towards the knee, sliding the foot in along the mat. Inhale and stretch again. Repeat this about 8 times on each side, resting in between as necessary. 4. Bird dog - unsupported The same as the previous exercise but with your leg stretched off the floor. 5. Child's pose A really restorative, grounding position. Use this to stretch your upper back and shoulders and breath deeply. If comfortable, sit with your toes together, knees wide. Alternatively, have your knees together. Stretch forward through your legs and let your arms flop over your head onto the mat. Breathe deeply to the centre of your back and belly for around 10+ breaths. Addition: move your arms to the right and feel the left side of your body, elongating, and breathe for 10 in this position before moving gently to the other side.  6. Modified push up These are great to start to build up strength on the arms, shoulders and back without stressing the abdominals too much.  Get into a plank position with your knees down. Move your knees closer to your arms for more support in the torso, and further away to make it more challenging. Do 10 push ups - lowering as far as you can while still being able to complete the move 10 times. There's not much point going all the way to the mat, but not being able to do more than one movement, so start small and build up your strength.  7. Squat Squats are a great full body movement. When performed quickly, they can raise your heart rate and they are good for leg strength. It's important to start with bodyweight only before adding weights postpartum to build up the correct movement patterns, technique and strength.   Start with your legs hip width apart, sitting your hips back and bending your knees. Don't let your knees go further forward past your toes, instead focus on the weight going backwards. Exhale as you come to standing and make sure you come all the way up and squeeze your glutes to finish the movement. 8. Thoracic rotation / thread the needle   This is a brilliant one for new mums who are spending so much time holding and feeding the baby. The upper body (chest and back) can feel so stiff and this movement is the perfect antidote.  Come to all fours as before. Take a full inhale and reach one arm up to the ceiling - don't worry if it doesn't go very far, just focus on the chest opening. On the exhale, thread the arm through and come to the mat with your ear, shoulder and elbow. Stretch the other arm long above your head on the mat. Breathe into where you feel the stretch - the back, armpit, arm - it should feel wonderful! Hold as long as you want and then repeat on the other side.  Move celebrates exercise in all its forms, with accessible features encouraging you to add movement into your day - because it's not just good for the body, but the mind, too. We get it: workouts can be a bit of a slog, but there are ways you can move more without dreading it. Whether you love hikes, bike rides, YouTube workouts or hula hoop routines, exercise should be something to enjoy. ",

    "0b9ff347333fa722858d920faba6580fa43fe1fb702654910bd6cb61": "Near the beginning of Boris Johnson's tricky interview on ITV's Good Morning Britain, presenter Susanna Reid warned the PM: 'There are fact checkers at every stage of every interview who will go through your answers with a fine-tooth comb.' Which is exactly what the independent FullFact website did. Having run the rule over three of Johnson's answers, to put it charitably, they found him wanting. Freedom passes In one of the stand-out moments, the prime minister was challenged over the cost of living crisis hitting many people across the country.  Reid told Johnson about Elsie, a 77-year-old widow, who has seen her energy bills rise from PS17 a month to PS85 a month.   'To cut down on spending, Elsie has now resorted to eating one meal a day. She's 77-years-old. She's losing weight,' Reid said.    'She gets up early in the morning to use her freedom bus pass to stay on buses all day to avoid using energy at home. What else should Elsie cut back on?'   Johnson said he did not want Elsie to cut back on 'anything', before adding: 'Just to remind you, the 24-hour freedom bus pass was something I actually introduced.'    Aside from the strange boast about Elsie's bus pass, his ownership of the policy is not exactly as he presented it. The pass has a history going back to the 1980s, which predates the creation of the position of directly elected mayor. Johnson did make the freedom pass apply for 24 hours per day (except on some national train services) in early 2009, says FullFact, but free 24-7 bus travel for pensioners was curtailed in 2020. The fact-checkers said: 'As Mayor of London, Boris Johnson did change the Freedom Pass so it applied 24 hours a day on most services, although he did not introduce it originally. 'Following a bailout deal between Transport for London and Mr Johnson's government in 2020, it no longer functions 24 hours a day.' Economic growth Johnson's claims the government had powered to a strong economic position after emerging from the Covid pandemic caused another flashpoint. 'That is what we are achieving,' he began. 'It's because of the steps this government took during the pandemic to get us out of the pandemic in a strong way. 'With the fastest economic growth in the G7.' Reid interjected: 'Okay, we've heard you say this before.' And Johnson fired back: 'Well, you've just told me I haven't been on your programme for five years, so you can't have heard me.' Reid argued: 'But I do listen and watch all your other interviews.' Away from the back and forth, FullFact suggests the claim is misleading. It says:  'According to the latest data, the UK had the highest growth in 2021 among G7 nations. However this is partly due to a technicality concerning how the UK measures GDP, which increased the apparent scale of both the fall and the recovery. The UK's economy has shrunk by about 0.4% since the start of the pandemic, making it the fifth best performing among the G7 nations.'  Council tax  The prime minister said that for lower council tax people should vote for Conservative in Thursday's local elections. 'When it comes to delivering better value for services, lower council tax...you should vote for Conservative councillors on Thursday,' he said. In parliament last week, Johnson noted that Conservative-controlled Westminster Council has lower council tax than Labour-controlled Islington and Camden, saying: 'That is the difference between Labour and Conservative across the country.' FullFact pointed out the picture is less clear cut than that. The Conservatives have tended to compare band D rates to claim their councils charge less than Labour authorities - and using this measure, single-tier Tory areas in England charge less than the average in Labour areas. Single-tier Conservative councils in England actually charge more per household, and regardless like-for-like comparisons are extremely difficult to make. 'There are many reasons why council tax might vary between Conservative and Labour areas, reflecting the different services those areas need to provide,' says FullFact.",
    "41466dce0eb7eeb396d81b7d9b7ef4f9de77ce37de5bb5ff50c2c284": "Boris Johnson has won plaudits in Ukraine for the UK's support of the besieged country as he gave a speech to MPs in Kyviv. Speaking via video link to the Verkhovna Rada, the prime minister channelled the words of Winston Churchill - describing Ukraine's resistance against Vladimir Putin's invasion as its 'finest hour, that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come' - as he set out a new PS300m package of support for the Ukrainian military. Responding to his speech, Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko tweeted: 'Boris Johnson addressing Ukrainian parliament today. 'I have never seen this many standing ovations for a single speech. Ukraine is certainly lucky to have a friend like the UK.'  But domestically, his government's policies on Ukraine have prompted a cooler response. Would-be sponsors under the Homes For Ukraine visa scheme are threatening the home secretary Priti Patel with legal action on behalf of hundreds of refugees who have spent weeks waiting to come to the UK.  Latest figures show that of the 86,100 people given Ukraine scheme visas, 27,100 have so far arrived in the UK, and ministers are facing action over 'inordinate and unreasonable delays' in processing hundreds of visa applications made in March by refugees. Here is some information about the Homes for Ukraine scheme and the waits refugees and their UK sponsors have been experiencing. What is the scheme? The Homes for Ukraine programme allows individuals, charities, community groups and businesses to bring people escaping the war to safety even if they have no ties to the UK. Anyone with a room or home available for at least six months can offer it to a Ukrainian individual or a family, though those offering to host will be vetted and Ukrainian applicants will undergo security checks. The scheme opened for applications more than six weeks ago on March 18. How many UK sponsors have offered up their homes? More than 200,000 would-be hosts have registered their interest. Members of the public have been praised for their 'amazing' and 'incredible' generosity. Government officials believe some people applied for visas so they have the option of coming to the UK but are staying in countries bordering Ukraine so they can return home sooner, while others have changed their minds. There are also multiple cases where Ukrainians are unable to travel because some family members, usually young children, are waiting for longer than their relatives for their documents. And there are reports of some refugees not being made aware that they have permission to travel. Why is the government facing legal action? There have been widespread concerns about the length of time refugees have been waiting for their visas under the scheme. Would-be hosts have compiled figures showing that hundreds of Ukrainians who applied for visas within the first two weeks of its launch are still waiting. The groups who are threatening legal action on behalf of those waiting - Vigil 4 Visas and Taking Action Over The Homes For Ukraine Visa Delays - say the delays have put people in Ukraine and border countries at risk and heaped 'considerable pressure and strain' on UK hosts. A judicial review could be brought on the grounds that the Home Office has a policy of delaying the March applications and deciding later applications instead - or that the system is 'so chaotic and unstable' that it is unreasonable. What has the government said? In an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain, Johnson admitted the UK could have reacted faster in helping Ukrainian refugees, though he said 'large numbers' are now coming to Britain. Previously, the government has acknowledged that waits of several weeks for some refugees are 'unacceptable'. In early April, Patel apologised 'with frustration' after coming under fire over the time it was taking for refugees to arrive. And refugees minister Lord Harrington previously said the process was too long and not 'as seamless as it should have been'. A government spokesman said it has streamlined the visa system, simplified the forms, and boosted staff numbers and that officials are 'now processing visas as quickly as they come in'.",

Jonathan, who is originally from Wales, reached the semi-final of Simon Cowell's US talent show in 2020 after reaching the final of Britain's Got Talent the previous year. In October last year, he was rehearsing at the Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton, Georgia for America's Got Talent: Extreme when he fell 30 feet to the ground after being crushed between two cars in midair. The stunt was supposed to see the escapologist free himself and fall underneath the vehicles before they collided but the cars were released too early. His fiancee, the Sherlock actor Amanda Abbington has now revealed the horrifying extent of his injuries, which have left him paralysed. 'He fell 30 feet and lost a kidney, broke both shoulder blades, shattered both legs,' she told Jay Rayner on the Out To Lunch podcast. 'Third degree burns, broke his spine, severed his spinal cord and nearly died. And then on the operating table, he nearly died again. 'He's just been in rehab since October... He's paralysed now, he's in a wheelchair. Unless there's a kind of stem cell surgery or that thing that Elon Musk is designing with the little chip, he'll be like that [forever].' Despite his devastating injuries, Amanda said Jonathan has stayed 'positive and upbeat and so strong'. Amanda also recalled receiving a voicemail from Jonathan before his surgery, when he told her he loved her and said there was a 50% chance he wouldn't make it. Thankfully, he survived and the 41-year-old has been keeping fans updated on his recovery. Jonathan previously told fans after his accident: 'There is a long road to recovery and that won't look like what it did... 'I may leave the daft shit alone for a while, but I have a lot left to do in this world.' NBC promoted AGT: Extreme, an eight-episode spin-off from its highly successful America's Got Talent series, as a showcase of 'the most outrageous, unique and jaw-dropping acts of enormous scale and magnitude that simply cannot be confined to a theatre stage'. Production on the show, which was set to broadcast in 2022, was suspended following the accident to 'focus on the wellbeing of crew'.",
    "925f3345dece6b726c88dc1a10189a5c6087f4f5150b6b412c770f19": "People who survive intense Covid infections could experience brain damage comparable to ageing 20 years, according to a worrying new study. Although the UK is now months into the government's 'Living With Covid' strategy, that doesn't mean the disease has disappeared - more than 100,000 people have tested positive for the last week. Statista.com estimates 1.3 million people are suffering from long Covid symptoms as of January 2022. And scientists have now found that for those who had a severe infection, there is a chance that your cognitive recovery will be gradual. It's also possible that people with milder infections have been impacted.  How could your IQ be affected? Scientists from the University of Cambridge and Imperial College London have found severe infections could impair your cognitive function in the same way your brain naturally ages between 50 to 70 years old. This means people could lose around 10 IQ points from catching the deadly disease if Covid remains detectable in your system more than six months after the initial illness. The scientists' research suggested these long-term effects may even impact people who only had mild cases of Covid. The study looked at data from 46 individuals who received in-hospital care for Covid in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. Their results from various cognitive tests from around six months after they suffered from the acute illness were then compared to a control group. Those who had experienced more severe infections were found to be less accurate and slower to respond to the tests, particularly if they had to use mechanical ventilation through their illnesses. Yet, the impact on cognitive function may be felt by those who had more mild infections too. The scientists explained: 'By comparing the patients to 66,008 members of the general public, the researchers estimate that the magnitude of cognitive loss is similar on average to that sustained with 20 years ageing, between 50 and 70 years of age, and that this is equivalent to losing 10 IQ points.' What signs did scientists link to impairment?   Fatigue   Brain fog   Problems recalling words   Sleep disturbances   Anxiety   PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder)   Their memories, attention skills and reasoning abilities were all hit, as well as their problem-solving skills. According to the study, the slower processing abilities can be linked to the decreased brain glucose consumption in the part of the mind which is responsible for problem-solving and working memory. What does this mean for the future? Professor David Menon, the study's senior author from the University of Cambridge, said: 'Cognitive impairment is common to a wide range of neurological disorders, including dementia, and even routine ageing, but the patterns we saw - the cognitive 'fingerprint' of Covid - was distinct from all of these.' There were some early signs that this might be a temporary change, though. Prof Menon added: 'We followed some patients up as late as 10 months after their acute infection, so we were able to see a very slow improvement. 'While this was not statistically significant, it is at least heading in the right direction, but it is very possible that some of these individuals will never fully recover.' Still, he warned that around 400,000 people in the UK may be affected right now. And it's not the only study of its kind This particular set of data uses a relatively small sample size of just 46 individuals. However, another 2021 study from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City also found patients still suffered from cognitive impairment more than seven months after diagnosis. This date set studied 740 people with no prior history of memory problems. Individuals have been reporting long-lasting symptoms, including cognitive problems (often dubbed brain fog) for more than three months after the positive test since the pandemic really took hold of the UK back in 2020. Research from March - published in the scientific journal Nature - also found that Covid shrinks the human brain slightly even after a mild infection. It found that the overall brain size in 401 participants who had Covid experienced between 0.2 and 2% brain shrinkage months after their infection. However, the researchers were not able to discern if the changes were reversible, or what impact this had on the patients.",

Imran Ahmad Khan, who was elected MP for Wakefield, west Yorkshire, in 2019, was convicted at Southwark Crown Court three weeks ago. Jurors heard how he forced the teenager to drink gin and tonic, dragged him upstairs, pushed him on to a bed and asked him to watch pornography before the attack at a house in Staffordshire in January 2008. His resignation means there will be a by-election in his seat, which he won from Labour's Mary Creagh with a majority of 3,358. Under arcane parliamentary rules, MPs cannot directly resign their seat during a parliament and so have to apply for a paid office of the Crown. As a result, the Treasury today announced that Khan has been appointed Steward and Bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern. Khan's victim said he wasn't 'taken very seriously' when he first made his allegations to the Conservative Party press office days before the 2019 general election.  He made a complaint to police days after Khan helped prime minister Boris Johnson win a large Commons majority by taking Wakefield in the so-called 'red wall' that had formed Labour's heartlands in the Midlands and northern England.   The victim, now 29, told a jury he was left feeling 'scared, vulnerable, numb, shocked and surprised' after Khan touched his feet and legs, coming within 'a hair's breadth' of his privates, as he went to sleep in a top bunkbed.   He ran to his parents and a police report was made at the time, but no further action was taken because the youngster did not want to make a formal complaint.   But he told jurors 'it all came flooding back' when he learned Khan was standing for parliament. The Tory hopeful was literally parachuted into the constituency in a skydiving stunt after he was selected to replace Antony Calvert weeks before the election.  Khan claimed he only touched the teenager's elbow when he 'became extremely upset' after a conversation about his confused sexuality.   Khan, then 34, said he was trying to be 'kind' and 'helpful', but the teenager became upset and 'bolted' when the topic of pornography was raised. But he was found guilty by a jury after around five hours of deliberations. The date of the by-election will not be announced until next week at the earliest, but Labour will have high hopes of regaining a seat they had previously held since 1931. A separate by-election is also set to be held in Tiverton and Honiton after the sitting Tory MP, Neil Parish, announced he was also resigning after admitting he had twice watched porn in the House of Commons chamber.

Host Susanna Reid didn't waste anytime in grilling the squirming PM, kicking off proceedings at No.10 by asking him if he was a liar. Elsewhere, Susanna also asked the PM about the lockdown parties he was fined for, the war in Ukraine, and the cost of living crisis.  But it was the very end of the interview that provided an absolute zinger. As the PM attempted to get his final few words in, Susanna interrupted him to introduce Lorraine Kelly, whose daily morning programme airs right after GMB. 'Lorraine Kelly is waiting to take up all these issues that you have brought up in this interview,' Susanna told him. 'Who's Lorraine?' Johnson asked. Susanna replied: 'Who's Lorraine? Lorraine is a legend.' But it was Lorraine's reaction that made everyone's morning... 'Wow,' Lorraine said following the interview as the show linked back to the presenter in the ITV studio.  'A masterclass in a political interview, excellent stuff,' she added. Twitter had a lot of thoughts about the 'unforgivable' comment.... Lorraine saw the funny side when she referenced the comment in her mid-morning show , asking 'why should he know who I am?'. Asked if Boris Johnson knows who Lorraine is, the PM's spokesperson told HuffPost UK: 'I think as was clear the prime minister was not fully across the ITV daytime lineup this morning. He has a number of issues to deal with.' Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV. Lorraine follows at 10am.",

In a major blow for the controversial policy, the prime minister's official spokesman said legal challenges were one of the reasons behind the delay. Johnson announced last month that anyone arriving in the UK via supposedly 'illegal' means would be handed a one-way ticket to Rwanda. Downing Street sources made clear that they expected the first flights to take off by the end of May. Since the policy was announced, hundreds more migrants have continued to make the dangerous journey across the English Channel in search of a new life. The PM's spokesman this morning conceded that the government would miss its initial deportations target. He said: 'It's too early to judge what the situation will be long-term on this policy. You will know - as we've seen - migrant crossings continue, criminal gangs continue to profit. This is unsustainable.' Asked when the success or otherwise of the plan could be judged, the spokesman said: 'I don't think there's a fixed date ... obviously, there are a number of variables we need to deal with, not least some of the legal challenges which have been talked about.'

    "8c98767b87f691b1bb329a79257974cba0dc7f2060a37a6047ad4f1d": "News of abortion laws potentially being overturned in America should be 'a warning to us all', according to politicians and campaigners in the UK, who stress the disturbing situation in the US could have knock-on global effects. In the US, a leaked draft document appears to suggest the majority of US Supreme Court justices support overturning Roe v Wade - the historic case law that legalised abortion.  According to the news organisation Politico, which published the leaked document, the draft opinion shows the court voted to strike down the landmark case. However, it is unclear if the draft represents the court's final decision.  If the law is overturned, 26 out of 50 US states are 'certain or likely' to ban abortion, according to research from the think tank the Guttmacher Institute. Speaking to HuffPost UK, Mandu Reid, leader of the Women's Equality Party, described the news coming from the US as 'chilling'.  'It is an outright assault on the rights of American women, threatening to deny fifty percent of the population their bodily autonomy. It has ominous consequences for women everywhere and is a reflection of the global backlash against reproductive rights,' she says.  'It brings into sharp focus just how fragile the right to free, safe, and legal abortions is - and that applies to the UK too. Make no mistake, abortion access is not watertight in the UK, and has been under threat for years, as we've seen with recent threats to at-home abortions, the requirement for two doctors to sign off on an abortion, and the fact that it is still not a legal right.  'What is happening in America is a warning to all of us, and must be a catalyst for abortion to be codified in law and health policies here in the UK, as a matter of utmost urgency.' Although abortion is legal across the UK, under a law passed in 1861, any woman who ends a pregnancy without legal authorisation from two doctors can face up to life imprisonment, which is why campaigners continue to call for abortion to be decriminalised.  And although abortion was legalised in Northern Ireland in October 2019, access to appointments remains limited.  Parts of the UK have already experienced a rise in anti-abortion activists outside clinics in recent years, with some claiming to have been directly 'recruited' by American religious groups.  Elsewhere in the world, women's reproductive rights have already been rescinded. In 2021, Poland enforced a near-total ban on abortion, having previously allowed terminations.  On social media, many people have expressed concern that the latest US developments will only embolden those who hold anti-women views.  Moves to eradicate women's reproductive rights are particularly disturbing for women like Kyanne Smith, who had an abortion in April 2020 via the telemedicine home-abortion system. The 23-year-old from London says our rights must be proactively protected.  'We know that a ban on abortion doesn't stop them from happening; it just stops safe ones,' she says. 'If I hadn't been able to legally access a pregnancy termination, I would have found a way to get one. 'Where does this leave pregnant people in the US? It leaves them with forced births, unsafe terminations or spending an insane amount of money travelling to access basic healthcare, which isn't an option for many. If we stand by and let this happen across America, a dangerous precedent is set for the UK. Keep your awful laws off our bodies.'  Clare Murphy, chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) - one of the largest abortion providers in the UK - echoes these concerns.  'It sends a dangerous message internationally,' she says of the leaked document. 'In many other countries, women are still fighting for safe, legal abortion care. If the US were to revoke the constitutional right to abortion, this will ultimately hamper progress in other nations.'  BPAS has launched a petition addressed to Liz Truss in her role as foreign secretary, calling on the government to 'clearly condemn' the Roe vs Wade draft opinion as a breach of human rights. Boris Johnson's spokesperson said on Tuesday that the decision was 'a matter for the US courts', but added: 'The UK fully supports women's reproductive rights globally and including the right to access safe and legal abortion.' Conservative Caroline Nokes, the chair of the Commons women and equalities committee, told HuffPost: 'It is a deeply worrying attack on long established women's rights which I certainly hope we see no replication of here.' MSI Reproductive Choices (formerly named Marie Stopes), which works across 37 countries, is also concerned the draft report could have global consequences.  'If it stands it would be the biggest setback to women's rights in the US in a generation and deeply concerning for global reproductive rights,' the charity's head of advocacy, Sarah Shaw, says.  'Each year, 25 million women around the world resort to dangerous and unsafe methods. At MSI, our teams worldwide witness and deal with the terrible consequences of this every day. No one should be seeking to replicate this situation in the US. The right to choose must be protected.'",
    "3c5fabf2c6e644fd27ed18bd2dbd15e3d81be78808e8223d8a5dd051": "Are you still working from home? Whether it's still WFH all week or a hybrid-situation, many of us enjoy the opportunity to work from our home offices without worrying about transport costs, time, and other logistics such as lunch and outfits. But one company is offering all those things at a price. A law firm has said it is offering staff the chance to completely WFH...if they agree to take a 20% pay cut. Stephenson Harwood said it would allow remote working but pay employees 20% less off their salary.  The firm told the BBC that it has started recruiting remote workers on a lower salary as they're hiring people from around the country who no longer need to commute into the capital, saving them money. Those who do decide to come in on some days could then claim travel expenses. The firm is also offering the remote working option to existing staff, bar partners, and applying the salary difference between the two packages.  But, it said, they don't expect many people to take up the offer and go fully remote as the role requires some experience of the office environment. Since it revealed its pay-cutting plan, many have pointed out the problems with such a model. Harriet Minter, a hybrid-work consultant and author of WFH, How to Build a Career You Love when You're Not in the Office, said it would encourage the gender pay gap, as those who are likely to take up the offer of full remote working are to be women, who often have more care responsibility. She tells HuffPost that there are other implications for a move like this. 'The short term implication is that it's damaging for an employer's brand. All employers want to look progressive and like a good place to work, but threatening to cut the pay of staff that work remotely suggests that your business just wants to go back to the old ways of working - regardless of what your staff want. It's hardly progressive thinking.' HuffPost has contacted Stephenson Harwood about these concerns and will update this article if we receive a response.  There are other potential consequences too, including people resigning. 'It will impact staff retention and recruitment,' says Minter.  'We know there is a battle for talent at the moment, businesses which offer more flexible working practices, without any penalty for them, are going to have their pick of the best talent out there. And your employees who are already feeling devalued and under-motivated as a result of this policy, are going to leave to go somewhere they are appreciated and paid properly.' Others said that working from home doesn't mean working less. In fact, research shows that half of employees are working longer hours at home. And by taking away large office spaces, companies could also save on renting spaces.  So those putting in extra hours at home would be getting paid less for it.  Other firms such as Apple who are also considering more time in the office have faced similar pushback. Hundreds of people signed an open letter to CEO Tim Cook saying plans to return to the office for the majority of the time would make the brand 'younger, whiter and more male-dominated'.  They wrote that this 'will change the makeup of our workforce and lead to privileges deciding who can work for Apple, not who'd be the best fit.' Those that it would benefit include young people, those without family commitments, or with a stay-at-home partner (most likely to be men).   What are your thoughts. Would you take a pay cut to stay home? ",

ITV has confirmed that he'll be joining the judging panel for the upcoming second series of The Masked Dancer when it airs later this year. Crouchy will be taking over the seat usually occupied by Mo Gilligan, who has had to step aside due to filming commitments overseas. Explaining his absence, Mo said: 'I love being a part of the Masked team so I'm gutted to be missing most of the series this year as I'll be working in the US. BUT I've got the perfect sub to take my place. 'A legend on and off the pitch and one of the nicest guys in the industry, Crouchy knows a thing or two about fancy footwork, we've got this!'  The former England striker added: 'The show is a firm favourite in our household and when asked I jumped at the chance to take part. 'I am competitive and I'm currently scrolling through friends' socials looking for those tell-tale dance moves. Another plus is by being on the panel my social media, family and friends won't be constantly speculating that I'm hiding behind one of the masks!' Peter will be sitting alongside returning judges Davina McCall, Oti Mabuse and Jonathan Ross, with Joel Dommett once again on hosting duties. The Masked Singer's dance-centric sister show debuted on ITV last summer, with Olympian Louis Smith beating Bonnie Langford and Howard Donald in the star-studded final.

After this morning's roasting at the hands of Susanna Reid, it's likely to be even longer before he agrees to do so again. The PM's infamous run-in with a fridge before the 2019 election was the last time GMB came close to interrogating him live on air. There's a fair chance he was left looking for somewhere equally dark and cold in which to recover from this 25-minute grilling. Reid wasted no time in putting Johnson on the back foot by asking him: 'Are you honest, prime minister?' After eventually insisting that he was, the prime minister attempted to turn the discussion to the government's record. But Reid was having none of it, pointing out Johnson's reputation for having a loose relationship with the truth. It was already clear that if Number 10 thought this would be a soft soap interview giving the PM some free air time in the run-up to Thursday's local elections, they were sadly mistaken. The worst moment for Johnson - and there were a few to choose from - came when Reid told him about 77-year-old GMB viewer Elsie, who rides the bus all day because she can't afford to heat her home. Inexplicably, the prime minister attempted to make a virtue of her predicament by insisting - wrongly, as it turns out - that she could only do this because he had introduced the freedom pass for pensioners when he was mayor of London. 'Marvellous, so Elsie should be grateful to you for her bus pass,' Reid asked. A more empathetic politician would not have immediately sought to take credit for the fact that a pensioner is resorting to aimlessly travelling round London all day because it's preferable to being in her unheated home. As he attempted to bluster his way through the rest of his answer, Reid said: 'Prime minister, you can't say anything to help Elsie, can you?' The worry for the Conservative Party is that, with voters set to go to the polls in two days' time, the rest of the country has reached the same conclusion.",
    "e74d7ccc6b6fb2b3a8b518bb34623c7e4a71a8c1b0725ab63ff33a2e": "Katy Perry fully committed to the Disney theme on this weekend's American Idol when she dressed up as The Little Mermaid. However, after being carried to her chair behind the judging panel's desk - because, well, mermaids can't walk - the singer quickly found out the hard way that swivel chairs and finned tails really do not mix. Shortly after taking her seat, host Ryan Seacrest's face said it all before the cameras quickly panned round to show Katy flat on her back with her mermaid's tail flapping about in the air. Katy's Little Mermaid costume is the latest outfit she's worn for the annual Disney-themed night. Since signing on to be a judge on the US show in 2018, the Firework singer has come dressed as Cinderella, Snow White, Ursula, Mrs Dumbo and Tinker Bell. Maybe pick one with legs next time, Katy? The singer swapped her mermaid costume for a stunning black Oscar de la Renta gown for Monday night's Met Gala. It was a decidedly more understated look than usual for the star, who is well-known for rocking up to the annual fashion bash in some over-the-top outfits. In 2019, she dressed up as both a chandelier and a cheeseburger for the Camp-themed red carpet event. Ahead of this year's event, Katy told Page Six that she intended to switch it up 'You know, it would be pretty obvious for me to go play the kooky, crazy, wild, big, fun, colourful card,' she said last month.  'This time, I'm going to play a whole different card. Maybe I'll just come in a suit of armour or something. Maybe I'm not even going, because I'm going to send someone the armour and they're just going to pretend to be me.'",
    "b0caa028ed1a3098b5da5805a63eb87a0ba5a7441c8c7b03917122fd": "The UK 'fully supports' the right of women to access abortion, Downing Street has said. It comes after reports the US Supreme Court is about to remove the right of people in the United States to legally have an abortion. A document leaked to Politico has suggested the court is prepared to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision which granted the nationwide right. Boris Johnson's spokesperson said on Tuesday the decision was 'a matter for the US courts'. But added: 'The UK fully supports women's reproductive rights globally and including the right to access safe and legal abortion.' The report came amid a legislative push to restrict abortion in several Republican-led states -- Oklahoma being the most recent -- even before the court issues its decision. Critics of those measures have said low-income women will disproportionately bear the burden of new restrictions. The leak jumpstarted the intense political reverberations that the court's ultimate decision was expected to have in the midterm election year. Already politicians on both sides of the aisle were seizing on the report to fundraise and energise their supporters on either side of the issue. Until now, the court has allowed states to regulate but not ban abortion before the point of viability, around 24 weeks.",
    "793004b24e4c3e1332d5b57e8829bf2be78cf5929257f97237bc6b07": "Kim Kardashian definitely turned heads when she turned up to this year's Met Gala in one of Marilyn Monroe's most iconic dresses - but not everyone was sold on the fashion moment. The reality TV personality, known for starring in Keeping Up With The Kardashians, has become a style icon and beauty mogul in her own right over the years. So it's hardly surprising that Kardashian made headlines by wearing the exact dress Monroe wore in 1962, when she seductively sang Happy Birthday Mr President to JF Kennedy. However, people have pointed out several significant problems with Kardashian's look - especially when it came to her preparation for the event. The star revealed she had to lose 16 pounds in three weeks just to fit into the dress when speaking to Vogue magazine on the red carpet. She said: 'It was such a challenge. It was like a role. I was determined to fit.' 'I always thought she [Monroe] was extremely curvy,' Kardashian continued. 'I imagined I might be smaller in some places where she was bigger and bigger in places where she was smaller. 'So when it didn't fit me I wanted to cry because it can't be altered at all.' Kardashian even detailed how she lost more than a stone in such a short time. 'I would wear a sauna suit twice a day, run on the treadmill, completely cut out all sugar and all carbs, and just eat the cleanest veggies and protein. I didn't starve myself but I was so strict.' Losing so much weight in less than a month is rarely - if ever - recommended by health experts, especially as sweating out your water weight through a sauna suit is likely to just leave you severely dehydrated. The TV personality also said she wanted to 'cry tears of joy' when she finally fit into the gown, a direct contradiction of the positive messages coming from health and fashion campaigners that clothes are meant to fit our bodies, not the other way around. Kardashian skipped the afterparty for the event, too, and revealed she was going to gorge on 'pizza and doughnuts' instead. Again, binging is rarely a practice promoted by health professionals as it can have a huge impact on your body, especially after following such a strict diet. The star's weight loss is the latest talking point in the ongoing conversation about how we talk about our diets. It comes just after the UK decided to introduce calorie counts on restaurant menus, which already prompted fears that we are going backwards in our approach to body image. This isn't the first time Kardashian has faced significant backlash for promoting an unhealthy approach to her appearance either. In 2018, her sisters could be heard telling the star she 'looks anorexic' and 'really skinny' on her Instagram stories, to which Kardashian replied: 'Oh my god, the compliments!' The star has been criticised for her heavy use of Photoshop and accused of setting unrealistic beauty standards for her 307 million Instagram followers through her altered posts. Kardashian has promoted questionable weight loss products in the past too, including an appetite suppressant lollipop and so-called diet teas.

In a combative interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain on Tuesday morning, the prime minister was challenged over the cost of living crisis hitting many people across the country. Presenter Susanna Reid told Johnson about Elsie, a 77-year-old widow, who has seen her energy bills rise from PS17 a month to PS85 a month. 'To cut down on spending, Elsie has now resorted to eating one meal a day. She's 77-years-old. She's losing weight,' Reid said. 'She gets up early in the morning to use her freedom bus pass to stay on buses all day to avoid using energy at home. What else should Elsie cut back on?' Johnson said he did not want Elsie to cut back on 'anything', before adding: 'Just to remind you, the 24-hour freedom bus pass was something I actually introduced.' Reid replied: 'So Elsie should be grateful?' As London mayor in 2012, Johnson moved to ensure people aged 60 and over were entitled to free travel around the city, after the age at which people were eligible began to creep upwards.  Jon Ashworth, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'It is utterly shameful that pensioners have no choice but to sit on the bus all day to avoid racking up heating bills at home, or are left shivering in blankets and only eating one meal a day.  'For Boris Johnson to respond by boasting about the London bus pass reveals just how out of touch this narcissistic Prime Minister is.' The government has set out a PS9 billion package of loans to cut energy bills and council tax rebates, but the PM faces calls to go further. Johnson insisted his government was doing 'everything we can' to help with the cost-of-living crisis. He warned that increasing state support beyond its current levels could drive inflation even higher. And Johnson said there was 'global context' caused by a surge in energy prices which is hitting all aspects of the economy including food, adding: 'The cost of chickens is crazy.' Labour has called for a windfall tax on on oil and gas firms to provide more direct help for cash-strapped households and businesses. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that price rises were the 'single most pressing issue keeping people up at night'.",
    "16018b72f238d697e4463153fd0bb26b32aabeeaa8bf6a72865e187a": "Boris Johnson has insisted he is 'honest' -- despite admitting he 'inadvertently' gave false statements in parliament over the partygate row. The prime minister was taken to task over his record of honesty by Good Morning Britain host Susanna Reid. She last interviewed Johnson since on the show five years ago when he was foreign secretary. Johnson has boycotted the programme since he famously hid in a fridge during the 2019 general election campaign to avoid a grilling from former host Piers Morgan in the studio. Reid kicked off the testy interview by asking Johnson: 'People want to know, are you honest, prime minister? He replied: 'Yes. I think the best way to judge that is to look at what this government says it's going to do and what it does.' Reid then asked: 'You're an honest speaker?' 'Yes,' Johnson replied.  'I do my best to represent faithfully and accurately what I believe, and sometimes it's controversial and sometimes it offends people, but that's what I do.' Last month Johnson was subject to a successful vote in parliament calling for an urgent investigation into claims he misled MPs about parties hosted in Downing Street during the pandemic. The prime minister repeatedly told the Commons that no rules were broken and that guidance was followed at all times as the partygate scandal began to break at the end of last year. Johnson was then slapped with a fine from the Metropolitan Police last month for attending a birthday party hosted for him in the Cabinet room in No.10 on June 19, 2020, when gathering indoors between more than two people was banned. The fine led to more calls for the PM to resign and raised questions over the credibility of his answers to MPs. Later in the interview Reid asked Johnson about the reputation he had garnered for lying. 'Sometimes people say you lie, prime minister,' she asked. Johnson hit back: 'If you're talking about the statements I made in the House of Commons, I was inadvertently, I was wrong, and I've apologised for that.' While the Met has said it will not issue any further fines during the local elections, Tory MPs remain nervous that the scandal will cast a shadow on Thursday 5 May, when voters elect or re-elect their councillors. Some estimates suggest the party could lose between 500 and 800 seats. A particularly bad result could prompt Tory MPs disaffected with Johnson to submit a letter of no confidence in Johnson, with 54 needed to trigger a vote on his leadership.",

The oil giant announced an underlying profit of PS5bn, more than double last year's figure and their biggest surplus in over a decade, thanks to soaring oil prices. But the prime minister rejected calls from opposition parties to impose a one-off levy on the companies, and to use the cash to help families cope with the cost of living crisis. The Prime Minister told ITV's Good Morning Britain that would 'discourage them from making the investments that we want to see that will, in the end, keep energy price prices lower for everybody'. He added: 'We have a short-term hit caused by the spike in energy prices across the world. 'If we respond by driving up prices and costs across the board in this country, responding by the government stepping in and driving up inflation, that will hit everybody. 'And that will mean that people's interest rates on their mortgages go up, the cost of borrowing goes up, and we face an even worse problem.' His comments appeared to put him at odds with chancellor Rishi Sunak, who last week told Mumsnet that he had not ruled out a windfall tax. He said: 'What I would say is that if we don't see that type of investment coming forward and companies are not going to make those investments in our country and energy security, then of course that's something I would look at and nothing is ever off the table in these things.' The cabinet split on the issue was highlighted on Sunday when business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said he was also opposed to a windfall tax. He told Sky News: ''I've never been a supporter of windfall taxes, I've been very clear about that publicly. I think they discourage investment.' Labour leader Keir Starmer said BP's profits demonstrated that a windfall tax is the 'right approach'. He told BBC Breakfast: 'I think those figures reinforce the case that we've been making, which is that, with so many people struggling to pay their energy bills, we should have a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in the North Sea who have made more profit than they were expecting. 'Have a windfall tax on that and use that to help people with their energy bills, up to PS600 for those who need it most.' Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said: 'The Conservative government's refusal to introduce a windfall tax on the super profits of oil companies is becoming impossible to justify.  'BP is raking in eye-watering profits while millions of people struggle to pay the bills. It is an unforgivable lack of leadership from Boris Johnson at a time of national crisis.'",

'Now it is time for an older woman to take the reins.' The 77-year-old star added that she hopes to have changed people's perceptions on what older women are capable of. 'I hope too I've encouraged TV bosses to realise that not all women at the wrong end of their seventies are in care homes playing bingo and watching conjuring tricks,' she said. 'In fact the genius of Countdown is that it's a brilliant way to keep the brain exercised. I run 5k most days of the week. 'And I can now do an anagram at twice the speed I could this time last year.' Anne said she now plans to spend more time with her family and at her home in New York.

Anne followed in the footsteps of original host Richard Whiteley, who launched the show in 1982. Des Lynam, Des O'Connor and Jeff Stelling have all also sat in the hot seat. Since Anne joined the show in 2021, there have been persistent rumours in the press about her working relationship with the programme's resident maths expert Rachel Riley. Rachel admitted Anne was 'not the cuddliest person in the world' amid reports of behind-the-scenes feuding but played down rumours of any on-set tension. 'You've got some women there and they want to make something up. I've seen the headlines of feuds escalating,' Rachel said last year. The new mum then added: 'I've been on maternity leave for about six to eight weeks.' However, Rachel did go on to admit that her and Anne weren't exactly best mates.

Nicola Coughlan, best known for playing Penelope Featherington on the hit Netflix series, channeled her character with a regal pink-and-black dress with puff sleeves and, most appropriately, *feathers.* Meanwhile, Simone Ashley, who starred as Kate Sharma in Season 2 of the period series, wowed in a corset and skirt with statement sleeves. Fans were disappointed, however, when the diamond of Season 1 failed to produce the splendor they're used to seeing on her in the Regency-era drama. Phoebe Dynevor, aka Daphne Bridgerton, left some onlookers underwhelmed in a relatively muted black dress. From dramatic puff sleeves to corsets, ruffles, lace floral prints and opulent jewelry, Shonda Rhimes' adaptation of Julia Quinn's novels has been filled with fashion statements. Fans expected that to align with the theme of 2022's Met Gala, which asked attendees to 'embody the grandeur -- and perhaps the dichotomy -- of Gilded Age New York.' The one Bridgerton character who really would have met the brief, sadly, did not make an appearance.",

Lively, who's co-chair of this year's Met Gala alongside her husband Ryan Reynolds, ignited the red carpet with her arrival on Monday evening.  Donning a copper Atelier Versace gown, Blake and her assistants performed an unexpected switch-a-roo right in the middle of the carpet.  Her bow-embellished dress metamorphosed into an aqua blue showstopper as her assistants helped 'unwrap' it on the red carpet.  'I arrived copper and then, like New York City classic architecture, I patinaed,' the actor said of her unveiling.  Resembling iconic New York City landmarks like the Empire State Building, the dress was accessorised with a crown featuring seven spikes in a nod to the Statue of Liberty. The Gossip Girl star said this year's event was 'especially nerve-wracking.' 'Being one of the hosts, you really feel like you need to bring your A-game,' she said.  This year's Met Gala theme was In America: An Anthology of Fashion, but Blake put her own twist on it by representing New York and focusing on the 'architecture rather than just the fashion.'  The actor has dominated the Met Gala red carpet over the years, and she has yet to disappoint.  At the 2018 Gala, themed Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, she sported a crimson Versace gown with an embroidered bodice, an extra-long train and lots of bejeweled action.

Just eight short months after we kinda sorta saw Kim Kardashian in her infamous all-black look at the Met Gala in 2021.  Vogue's annual fashion extravaganza at the Metropolitan Museum of Art has traditionally taken place during the first Monday in May. But thanks to Covid, last year's fashion fete got bumped from spring to September. So if you thought you were partaking in the great pandemic tradition of questioning your sense of time, don't worry. You're fine. But if you're wondering about the theme of Monday night's event, be prepared to be perplexed once more. The theme this year was In America: An Anthology of Fashion, which is a sequel to last year's theme, In America: A Lexicon of Fashion. People described the dress code as white-tie with an emphasis on 'Gilded Glamour.'  The Gilded Age was a tumultuous period between the Civil War and the turn of the 20th century that was known for robber barons, drama and grandeur. It was also a time of social inequality, in which a small population of elite folks enjoyed oodles of wealth. Think: John D. Rockefeller, Cornelius Vanderbilt and J.P. Morgan -- and Bertha Russell (Carrie Coon) and her fabulous, over-the-top hats in HBO's The Gilded Age. There weren't a ton of hats at the 2022 Met Gala, but there were plenty of capes, bodices and dramatic colours, plus a pirate of two (we're looking at you, Shawn Mendes and Lenny Kravitz) and what appeared to be, uh, gilded pasties (see: Cara Delevingne). Kim Kardashian's nod to America of yore was sporting the iconic dress Marilyn Monroe wore to sing Happy Birthday to President John F. Kennedy.

Before the reality star hit the carpet, sleuths across social media were debating the chance of catching Kim in the gown due to some not-so-subtle hints she dropped about this year's event.  Last month during an interview with Access Hollywood, she shared that her attire was still in the works for fashion's biggest night because the fit had to be exact. 'It really depends if I fit into my dress, so I hope I'm going,' she said. 'I think it will be up to the last minute because it can't be tailored, so I have to fit into it like exactly.' Only two weeks later, Kardashian and boyfriend Pete Davidson were spotted in Orlando, Florida, visiting the Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum, where the iconic dress Marilyn wore while singing 'Happy Birthday' to President John F. Kennedy is stored, according to The Sun. There was even a Reddit thread dedicated to speculating about what Kim would wear, with some suggesting that Marilyn's high-profile dress aligns with this year's white-tie 'Glided Glamour' dress code. The iconic dress became famous after her breathy, seductive take on 'Happy Birthday' at a fundraiser for Kennedy and the Democratic National Committee in 1962. Kim knows how to create some serious buzz with her previous Met Gala looks, including last year's widely memed Balenciaga 'shadow' ensemble and her jaw-dropping, barely-there corseted latex dress worn in 2019.",

    "a5fc4bb5373844b1b5c4b862367537ef0841afdbe9838f096937a753": "Matthew Rechs, who works in product design at a tech company, first became a manager roughly 25 years ago.  He'll be the first to admit that he wasn't the best leader back in those days. In fact, by his own account, he was 'a terrible manager' back then. These days, Rechs says he's considerably better at leading - and a tweet thread he posted earlier this month that went viral seems to vouch for that. In the thread, titled 11 Promises From a Manager, Rechs, who's also a career and business coach, outlined the kind of relationship he tries to forge with employees who report to him directly. As he sees it, the manager-employee relationship should emphasize clarity and trust while also prioritising the individual worker's needs. 'I've managed about 100 people since I first started,' Rechs told HuffPost in an email. 'At some point I discovered the idea of servant leadership, which for me means that leaders should center the needs of their people rather than themselves.'  Rechs' promises as he wrote them are as follows:     We'll have a weekly 1:1. I'll never cancel this meeting, but you can cancel it whenever you like. It's your time.   Our 1:1 agenda will be in the meeting invite so we remember important topics. But you're always free to use the time for whatever's on your mind.   When I schedule a meeting with you, I'll always say *when I schedule it* what it's meant to be about. I will not schedule meetings without an agenda.   When I drop into your DM's, I'll always say 'hi and why.' No suspense, no small talk while you are wondering what I want.   News or announcements that significantly impact you, your work, or your team will come from me directly in a 1:1, not revealed in a big meeting.   You'll get feedback from me when it's fresh. There will be no feedback in your performance review that you're hearing for the first time.   I trust you to manage your own time. You don't need to clear with me in advance your time AFK or OOO.   Your work gets done your way. My focus is on outcomes, not output. Once we're clear on where we need to go, how to get there is up to you. If I ever find it necessary to suggest a specific approach, I will supply an example.   A team is strongest when it's working together, looking after one another, and taking care of each other. Please look to your left and to your right for opportunities to help your colleagues. Please ask for help when you need it. Nobody works alone.   I trust you to skip level and talk to my manager or other senior management about anything you feel is relevant. You don't need to clear it with me, and I'm not going to get weird about it when you do.   I will attribute credit appropriately to you and your team. I will never exaggerate my own role or minimize your contribution. I'll be especially certain to nail down attribution when senior management are hearing of our accomplishments.   At the end of the Twitter thread, Rechs shared the one thing he asks in return from his direct reports.  'If this sounds good to you, please reciprocate by giving me in return what I need most: The truth. Give me your feedback, say when I'm wrong, and tell me your ideas for how we can do better,' he wrote. 'If we trust each other, we can learn and grow together. That's how I want to work with you.' The initial tweet in the thread has racked up 7,124 retweets and 57,300 'likes' since Rechs posted it on April 18. 'This is what good leadership looks like,' one man said in a quote-retweet. Another joked, 'This is one of the most valuable threads I've run across and I'm bookmarking it as Best Practices For Not Freaking Out People With Anxiety. (hi. it's me.).' Melody Wilding, an executive coach and author of Trust Yourself: Stop Overthinking and Channel Your Emotions for Success at Work, isn't surprised the thread went viral.  With returns to offices happening in a hybrid form for many workers and with so many traditional workplace structures being reexamined, employees want to hold on to the autonomy they gained during the coronavirus pandemic, Wilding said. 'This thread encapsulates what employees want most right now: clarity, empathy, and transparency and trust,' she said.  'Bosses need to show their teams they trust them,' she added. 'It doesn't matter how something gets done as long as the final work product meets expectations. It's far more important that your team feels ownership and autonomy.' Workplace expert Lynn Taylor was a fan of the thread, too, but she had one minor criticism: When it comes to promise number 10 on the list - the one in which Rechs tells his direct reports it's fine to skip levels and talk to his manager and other senior management if they need to - Taylor doesn't think most bosses will be quite as open-minded about that. 'That's a highly motivational approach,' said Taylor, the author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job. 'It may be a lofty goal in real life with some managers.' The best approach may be to test the waters first; maybe you even reference the viral tweets. 'Ask your manager how they feel about the idea,' Taylor said.  S. Chris Edmonds, a human resources expert and founder of The Purposeful Culture Group, wishes more managers would adopt the kind of leadership style described in the tweets.  'These 'promises' seem to be founded on service to team members, and far too few leaders see their jobs as serving,' he told HuffPost. 'One-on-one meetings, for instance, are one of the most powerful ways leaders can serve, develop, coach and validate their team members.' Most leaders 'are trained to focus on results, not respect,' Edmonds added. 'They have leadership role models that drive performance above all else.' Ultimately, though, there's room for growth with any manager, even bad ones. Rechs himself is proof of that. 'I don't believe in bad managers anymore,' he told us. 'No manager of mine was as bad, probably, as I have been myself. There really is no growth without failure.' ",

But now, a campaign has launched to accurately reflect the diversity of women and their bodies, in a bid to help all woman access the healthcare they need. In a new digital gallery, titled The Reframing Revolution, designers have created dozens of new illustrations to be released into the medical field, showing demonstrations of the following on a variety of skin tones:    IVF Bruising   PCOS   Linea nigra   Pregnancy breast changes   Ectopic pregnancy   Vaginal birth   Stillbirth   Postpartum body   C-section   Jaundice in babies   Breastfeeding   Hair loss   Hot flashes   Vulvas   It comes after a picture of a Black foetus, created by illustrator Chidiebere Sunday Ibe, went viral on social media last year.  The latest project was spearheaded by the women's community app Peanut and informed by doctors and medical illustrators.  They worked with Dr Somi Javaid, OB/GYN doctor, surgeon, and founder of HerMD, and the team at Biotic Artlab, a visual communications studio specialising in creative solutions for science and medicine, to ensure accurate depictions of the anatomy and recognition of underrepresented groups of women.  The campaign highlights how women have historically been misrepresented in healthcare, portraying all female anatomy as one-size-fits-all, when the reality is there is no 'normal' when it comes to body types.  One in four women has a degree of asymmetry in their breasts. Meanwhile, 97% of OBGYNs have been asked by women of all ages about genital normality, yet not all could confidently feel they could express what normal is. Using healthcare's current images of the female body is extremely damaging to both women's physical and mental wellbeing. When women don't fit within a biased image - particularly mothers, Black and other minority women and those who have traditionally fallen outside of commonly portrayed bodies - their representation is eliminated, which means they do not receive the healthcare they need.  Currently medical textbooks only show 17% of images as POC and of those images, a majority (75%) are women with light skin tones.  The unconscious bias in education can lead to inequity in medical practice often which has fatal consequences. Black women face greater barriers to accessing proper healthcare. Black women in the UK are still four times more likely to die in childbirth, for example. Omitting diverse bodies in medical literature allows a gateway for bias to enter medical treatment. The new gallery of images is available, royalty-free, for women, media, and the medical community to adapt into practices, journals, and more.  'It's just as important, if not more so, for women to see themselves in healthcare as they do in media and business,' Michelle Kennedy, founder and CEO of Peanut said. 'Women have been misdiagnosed and mistreated because their healthcare provider didn't recognise their physical symptoms on non-white skin. 'Our goal with these new illustrations is to not only educate patients and the medical field, but society at large. Women and mothers in all their forms, sizes and identities need to be represented.' Dr Somi Javaid added: 'As practitioners, it is our job to treat every patient to the best of our ability. When there are clear biases in the tools we use to diagnose, we're not bringing our best to every patient 'These new illustrations will showcase the diverse bodies and skin tones healthcare providers will see in their daily rounds and change the course of how we treat patients who have been underrepresented and under treated for so long.'

    "4d8ff12ef67d7786bd193b8086bdfe6d17ae0aeafab12af6f14f2b15": "Boris Johnson appears to have left his map at home while campaigning in the north east of England ahead of Thursday's crunch local elections. The prime minister left his partygate woes in London on May Day bank holiday Monday as he was pictured on his official Twitter feed with an ice-cream and surrounded by young people taking photos. An accompanying tweet read: 'It was a fantastic day to be out campaigning in Teesside, where we're delivering a massive programme of investment as part of our plan to level up the whole of the UK.' The trouble is, as plenty were keen to point out, he wasn't in Teesside. As The Whitley Whaler fish and chip shop in the background suggests, the PM was in Whitley Bay, the seaside town on Tyneside - or on the River Tyne, not the River Tees. 'Erm...how to say this...?,' tweeted Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. 'That's NOT Teesside.' While both areas would have been part of the sprawling Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, Whitley Bay today falls within the authority of North Tyneside Council, which goes to the polls on Thursday. Middlesbrough, on the banks of the River Tees, is 40 miles away, and Teesside is split between County Durham and North Yorkshire for the purposes of local governance. While there's every chance Johnson himself did not pen the geographically-confused tweet, someone on Team Johnson appears to have spotted the error and deleted the indiscretion - replacing it with a tweet referencing the safer 'north east'. But Twitter never forgets.",

Speaking by video link, the prime minister will use a speech on Tuesday to call the fightback Ukraine's 'finest hour' as he set out details of a new PS300 million package of military support. Downing Street said it will include electronic warfare equipment, a counter battery radar system, GPS jamming equipment and thousands of night vision devices, as Russia's offensive in the Donbas region continues. It follows Johnson's unannounced visit to the Ukrainian capital last month, in a show of support and solidarity with president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In his address, the prime minister will echo the words of Britain's leader during the Second World War, as Zelenskyy did when he spoke to the Westminster parliament in March. 'When my country faced the threat of invasion during the Second World War, our parliament, like yours, continued to meet throughout the conflict, and the British people showed such unity and resolve that we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour,' Johnson is expected to say. 'This is Ukraine's finest hour, an epic chapter in your national story that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come. 'Your children and grandchildren will say that Ukrainians taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free.' The latest military support package comes after ministers updated Parliament last week on plans to send sophisticated long-range Brimstone missiles and Stormer air defence vehicles. In addition, the UK is to supply heavy lift aerial drones to provide logistical support to Ukrainian forces which have become isolated. Downing Street said it is also sending more than a dozen new specialised Toyota Land Cruisers to protect civilian officials in eastern Ukraine and to evacuate civilians from frontline areas, following a request from the Ukrainian government.",

Kate Middleton and Prince William celebrated their only daughter's big day by releasing three portraits of the young royal on Sunday, a day ahead of her 7th birthday.  'Seven tomorrow! ' the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge captioned two of the photos of Charlotte that they posted to Instagram on Sunday. The photos were taken in Norfolk over the weekend by the duchess, who is an avid photographer and regularly takes pictures of her family.  One of the photos is a shot of Charlotte and the family's relatively new dog, a cocker spaniel named Orla. The royal family got Orla last year from a litter raised by Kate's brother, James Middleton, after the death of their beloved dog Lupo.  Supporters on social media said Charlotte continues to look more and more like her great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, and her father, William.  The family recently celebrated another big birthday, as Prince Louis turned 4 on April 23.  The duchess snapped photos of her youngest running on the beach near the family's Anmer Hall, also in Norfolk.  Just a few days before Louis' big day, Queen Elizabeth celebrated her 96th birthday. In honour of her birthday, the Royal Windsor Horse Show released a photo of the monarch alongside two of her fell ponies, Bybeck Katie and Bybeck Nightingale.

The opposition leader said he 'wants the chance to make our case to voters' amid speculation the prime minister could trigger a snap poll in the autumn. Allies of the PM believe the prospect of an election later this year will prevent any attempt by Tory MPs to remove him as leader over partygate or if the Conservatives do badly in Thursday's local elections. But speaking to HuffPost UK while campaigning in Worthing, West Sussex, Starmer said: 'I'm ready any time for an election. 'We've done a huge amount of work in the last two years and brought about an incredible change in the Labour Party and moved from an opposition to an alternative. 'The fact that here in Worthing we're talking about the possibility of a Labour council for the first time ever, I think shows how far we've come. 'We're absolutely focused on the issues that matter most to people at the moment. 'I don't mind when an election comes and I don't mind who the leader is on the other side. We want the chance to make our case because Britain deserves better.' Starmer also defended his decision to put Tony Blair in Labour's latest election video, despite the former leader's deep unpopularity with many activists who flocked to the party under Jeremy Corbyn. He said: 'I'm very clear that I'm happy to talk with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. They won three elections and the whole purpose of the Labour Party is to be a party of government and to change lives. 'I didn't come into politics to be in opposition. I want us to win an election because I want to bring about the change that a Labour government can bring about. 'I'm very happy to talk to winners and Tony Blair is a winner.' On accusations that he has taken Labour too far to the right, despite pledging to maintain Corbyn's legacy, Starmer said: 'I'm focused on the electorate and the people I need to persuade to vote Labour and the millions of people who will be better off with a Labour government. 'What we've done in the last two years is to change the Labour Party profoundly. What's driven that for me is the strong sense that if we lose as badly as we did in 2019, I don't look at the electorate and say 'what were you doing, why didn't you hear us'. 'I looked at Labour and said we must change as a party, and we have, whether that's with anti-semitism or whether that's being completely clear about our unshakeable support for NATO. But more profoundly, aligning the Labour Party to the priorities of so many millions of people across the country. 'We got far too distant from the issues that most people in the country are talking about in their kitchens, in their cafes and in their workplaces.' Starmer also all-but ruled out any chance of Jeremy Corbyn being re-admitted to the Labour Party. The former leader lost the party whip over his response to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission's report into anti-semitism in Labour when he was leader. Asked if he could have it returned, Starmer said: 'I think that's going to be pretty difficult given the issues that there are between us.'",

Neil Parish's political career came to an abrupt end after it emerged he was the Tory accused by female MPs of viewing inappropriate material in parliament. He admitted to the BBC on Saturday that he had twice watched adult content on his phone, claiming the first time was accidental after looking at tractors online. The select committee chairman had initially vowed to continue as MP for Tiverton and Honiton but said he would quit after recognising the 'furore' and 'damage' he was causing his family and constituency. Tory chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris suspended Parish from the parliamentary Conservative Party on Friday afternoon - three days after female Tory MPs first raised complaints of a male colleague watching porn on his phone in the Commons chamber. Parish's resignation means there will now be a by-election in his Devon seat, which he retained for the Tories at the last election with a majority of 24,239. Despite his dramatic fall from grace, Parish today received the support of Michael Fabricant, the Conservative MP for Lichfeld. He tweeted: 'Actually, I feel sorry for Neil. There. I've said it.' Friends of Parish have reportedly claimed he was searching for a 'Dominator' combine harvester when he first viewed porn in the Commons. Before being identified as the MP at the centre of the storm, Parish was asked about the allegations during an appearance on GB News. He was non-committal on whether the suspect should have the whip removed and denied there was a large cultural problem in Westminster, despite senior Conservative colleagues having decried it as being 'shameful'. 'We've got some 650 members of parliament in what is a very intense area,' Mr Parish said. 'We are going to get people that step over the line. I don't think there's necessarily a huge culture here but I think it does have to be dealt with and dealt with seriously and that's what the whips will do.' Earlier today, a minister poured cold water on suggestions that the Tory candidate to replace Parish should be drawn from an all-women shortlist. Universities minister Michelle Donelan told Sky News: 'I've never been in favour of shortlists and quotas. We've get more women in parliament by encouraging them, by breaking down barriers. 'We don't do it by putting in quotas which I find quite demeaning to women.'",

Crispin Blunt was forced to apologise after he criticised the conviction of Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan as 'nothing short of an international scandal'. Khan, the MP for Wakefield, forced the boy to drink gin and tonic, dragged him upstairs, pushed him on to a bed and asked him to watch pornography before the attack at a house in Staffordshire in January 2008. In a statement following his conviction, Blunt said: 'I hope for the return of Imran Ahmad Khan to the public service that has exemplified his life to date. 'Any other outcome will be a stain on our reputation for justice, and an appalling own goal by Britain as we try to take a lead in reversing the Victorian era prejudice that still disfigures too much of the global statute book.'  But after deleting his initial message of support the following day, Blunt said: 'On reflection I have decided to retract my statement defending Imran Ahmad Khan.   'I am sorry that my defence of him has been a cause of significant upset and concern not least to victims of sexual offences. It was not my intention to do this.'  Khan has since announced that he is standing down as an MP. In a statement posted on his website, Blunt - who was first elected as MP for Reigate in 1997 - made no reference to the furore as he announced he would stand down at the next election. He said: 'This statement is not the place for the tale of the ensuing 25 years, that may or may not follow when this particular parliamentary journey is concluded. But its purpose is to use this 25th anniversary to make public, what those closest to me have known privately for some time, that after seven increasingly tumultuous parliaments, this will be my last.' Blunt added: 'In looking forward to the next two years or so of this parliament, whilst securing my re-election is no longer an interest, there will be continued joy in representing the citizens I've had the honour to serve for 25 years.  'I still enjoy the personal motivation to do this to the best of my ability, using my experience in their interests, individual and collective; to help secure the future of the party that has given me this opportunity; and to also continue to call out long established populist views on policy shibboleths that continue to cause damage to our society and beyond.

    "1d3ebd8673f0055d1ac91224c1d864e55531fc375187b311d6ada8e0": "Almost half of women (44%) in employment say their ability to work has been affected by perimenopause and menopause symptoms, yet employers are still failing to address their needs. That's the damning finding in the largest ever survey of menopausal and perimenopausal women in the UK, which reveals a shocking lack of support for this demographic, who are routinely being ignored or bullied the workplace. The survey of more than 4,000 women aged 45-55 was commissioned by Channel 4 as part of Davina McCall's new documentary Sex, Mind & The Menopause - a follow-up to her agenda-pushing 2021 documentary Sex, Myths & The Menopause, in which the TV presenter shared her own experience and debunked some of the longstanding myths surrounding hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The latest programme focuses on the mind, exposing how memory loss and brain fog that begin during perimenopause as early as your 40s are pushing women out of work. The survey data has been analysed by the Fawcett Society, and a landmark report produced to lay bare the facts and crucial next steps.  The majority of women surveyed (77%) said they find at least one menopause symptom 'very difficult', while 44% of women experience three or more symptoms that are this severe. Women are most likely to say they find sleeping (84%), brain fog (73%), and anxiety or depression (69%) are difficult. The majority (eight in 10) of menopausal women say their workplace has no basic support in place for them - no support networks (79%), no absence policies (81%) and no information sharing with staff (79%). And the report uncovers the stigma many women face, with 41% saying they have seen symptoms treated as a joke by people at work. These are just a few of the quotes from anonymous women surveyed:   'I spent most of my time when I used to work with my head in a fan and colleagues laughing at my hot flushes. It was too hot in the office for me and I felt hot, sweaty and embarrassed all the time.'   'There is a stigma around the menopause in workplaces, it's a joke with most men and I don't think workplaces realise how horrible it can be.'   'I experienced being bullied at work and people not believing that my illness was real. I worked in a pharmacy, I was anxious, didn't want to go to work. It became that I didn't want to leave the house, it resulted that I walked out of my workplace and never returned.'   One in 10 women leaves a job completely under these circumstances, which equates to 333,000 women aged 45-55 in the workplace leaving their jobs due to the menopause. A further 13% of menopausal women who have been employed during menopause have considered leaving their job and 14% have reduced their hours.  The Fawcett analysis also exposes how some groups of women are disproportionately overlooked at work and in healthcare settings.  A fifth (21%) of women who have to wear uniform or a dress code to work say it is uncomfortable given their symptoms, rising to 28% among working class women.  Almost half (45%) of Black and minoritised women say it took many appointments for their GP to realise they were experiencing the menopause, compared to 30% of white women. And 22% of disabled women who have been employed during the menopause said they had left a job due to their symptoms compared to 9% for non-disabled women.  In this environment of stigma, almost half (45%) of women surveyed haven't spoken to their GP surgery about their symptoms. Of the women who have approached their surgery, 31% said it took many appointments before their GP realised they were experiencing menopause or perimenopause. Official guidance says that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be offered to women who are struggling with menopause symptoms, but just 39% of women say their GP or nurse offered HRT as soon as they knew they were experiencing menopause, and only 14% of menopausal women said that they are currently taking HRT. Recent HRT shortages have been widely reported as being due to increased demand - but this evidence suggests that we are only seeing the beginning of the potential rise in uptake. In light of the findings, the report recommends amending the Equality Act 2010 to ensure menopausal women are protected from discrimination at work. It also urges employers to create action plans on menopause and says the government should make flexible working the default.  Commenting on the findings, MP Carolyn Harris said: 'Women aren't asking for a lot - we make up 51% of the population and we all go through the menopause. But too many doctors are still out there prescribing antidepressants instead of HRT because they aren't getting sufficient training and they haven't got up to date information. And, whilst there are pockets of really good practice out there, too few employers are providing any form of support for the women who work for them. 'This is a big issue, and we need big solutions - but they don't need to be expensive or particularly complex. 'Women need the right information and support and for them to get that we need to ensure that medical professionals and employees are also getting the right information and support too - it's not that difficult to do.'

In another, the couple can be seen relaxing on a sunbathed yacht. 'I love you so much @davidbeckham you are the most incredible husband anyone could wish for and I feel truly blessed.

But often they are caught in a revolving door of repeat offending. This is hugely expensive for the taxpayer, highly disruptive for the children of women offenders, and doesn't work to tackle the root causes of women's offending. Many struggle with substance misuse or poor mental health. Some are coerced by a partner to commit crime or have themselves been the victims of abuse. Some commit crimes because they don't have enough money to pay the bills, or face homelessness on release. So when the government announced its female offender strategy in 2018, aiming to reduce the number of women in prison especially on short sentences, provide support on release from prison, and increase the proportion of women managed in the community, it was widely welcomed. But the Public Accounts Committee found that no meaningful progress has been made to implement the strategy. Worse, while PS200 million has been committed for 500 more places in women's prisons, only PS9.5 million has been spent on community solutions since 2018. Perhaps the relatively small number of women in custody has left the issue on the back burner. But the government's failure to prioritise the investment needed overlooks the ruinous financial, social and human costs of keeping women in custody. That's why we've said the Ministry of Justice must urgently assess the funding needed to improve outcomes for women and increase community provision. It must also publish what it aims to deliver, with an action plan and performance measures so that it can be held to account for progress. Implementing the strategy across government, and in partnership with specialist organisations, could transform the prospects of female offenders - and secure better value for the taxpayer.

'I've been so careful with myself that my own friends make fun of me,' the talk show legend told the Los Angeles Times in a lengthy interview. 'I didn't leave home for 322 days -- literally did not leave the house.' But the near-year spent at her sprawling California estate -- nicknamed 'The Promised Land' -- was no hardship. 'What has surprised me the most is how well I was able to adjust to the isolation and not being around other people,' Oprah said. 'I remember one point [Gayle King] said, 'Don't you just miss being around other people?' I go, 'Eh, not really.'' She believes part of the reason she adjusted so well is that it balanced out the years of intense social interaction her long career has brought her. 'I was in an audience of 350 people twice a day, so I've had shaking hands and autographs and selfies, and lots of attention, and exposure to being around a lot of people,' she said. But when she started staying home, she was 'able to be with myself in a way that I haven't been able to for years, because usually, even if I take time off for myself, I'm thinking about what is the next thing to come.' Oprah, a billionaire, acknowledged that she has a 'very blessed and privileged life,' and that a huge part of why she was able to embrace isolation is that she didn't have to worry about where her 'next paycheck' was coming from. She also wasn't totally alone for all 322 days. For one thing, she had longtime partner Stedman Graham, though he did famously quarantine in the guesthouse for two weeks at the beginning of the pandemic. She was also visited by close friend Gayle King -- along with King's team at CBS This Morning -- whom she also put on strict quarantine protocol. Oprah was talking to the Times to promote The Color of Care, a new documentary she executive-produced about the Covid-19 pandemic and racial disparities in the health care system. She was inspired to make the documentary after reading about Gary Fowler, a Black man who died of COVID in the spring of 2020 after multiple hospitals refused to help him. She was 'haunted' by the story and a photograph of Fowler, she told the Detroit Free Press, which was the first news outlet to cover the story. 'I want people to be aware that because of the colour of your skin, there are disparities in your ability to receive your rightful health care,' she said.",

Pearl - one of two projects announced as part of Harry and Meghan's Netflix deal - was set to focus on the adventures of a 12-year-old girl inspired by influential women from history. The Duchess of Sussex was to serve as an executive producer of the series alongside David Furnish - filmmaker and husband of Sir Elton John.   Pearl has been axed by Netflix as part of strategic decisions the streaming giant is making around animated series. It is understood Netflix has decided not to move forward with development on several projects, one of which is Pearl. This is believed to be not uncommon for development, and Netflix recently decided not to move forward with other animated series. Harry and Meghan signed a multimillion-pound deal with Netflix in 2020. The news that Pearl is being dropped comes after it emerged that Netflix lost 200,000 users over the first three months of 2022, falling well short of predictions it would add 2.5 million subscribers. Netflix has stumbled in the face of increased competition from the likes of Disney, Amazon Prime and the reopening of cinemas.   The US firm has seen its share value cut in half over the past six months as investors have grown increasingly concerned by the change in fortunes. Netflix said Archewell Productions remains a valued partner and they are continuing to work together on a number of projects, including the documentary series Heart Of Invictus. The show follows people competing at the Invictus Games, and a camera crew was seen close to Harry and Meghan during their time at the event in The Hague, Netherlands, last month. When Pearl was announced last July, Meghan said: 'Like many girls her age, our heroine Pearl is on a journey of self-discovery as she tries to overcome life's daily challenges. 'I'm thrilled that Archewell Productions, partnered with the powerhouse platform of Netflix, and these incredible producers, will together bring you this new animated series, which celebrates extraordinary women throughout history. 'David Furnish and I have been eager to bring this special series to light, and I am delighted we are able to announce it today.'   According to the Archewell website, Archewell Productions was created by Harry and Meghan 'to produce programming that informs, elevates and inspires'. The website - which says Archewell Productions will 'utilise the power of storytelling to embrace our shared humanity and duty to truth through a compassionate lens' - lists Heart Of Invictus and Pearl as the two 'exciting projects' it has announced.",

The former Strictly Come Dancing star was due to join the cast of the Andrew Lloyd Webber production as Prince Charming, however, the show will end next month, less than a year after its premiere. Cinderella, which has been playing at London's Gillian Lynne Theatre, has been hit with Covid-19 related disruption since the start, will play its final performance on 12 June. Responding to the announcement that the musical will close, former Bake Off champ John wrote on Instagram: 'This is heartbreaking news for me because I was due to take the role of Prince Charming in July, but more so for the current cast, band and production who have battled through Covid to bring a brilliant new show to the stage. 'My heart goes out to each and every one of them.' He continued: 'I was lucky enough to watch Cinderella in December 2021 and it was one of the most wonderful musicals I've seen in a long time. 'I was so excited to join the cast, and it was a lifelong dream come true, but sadly it isn't to be right now. Who knows what the future will hold - I won't lose hope.' The Cinderella premiere took place in August last year, having been scheduled to debut the previous month but was delayed due to Covid isolation protocols. The show opened with an audience capacity of 50% after the Lloyd Webber rejected Boris Johnson's offer for the show to be included in the coronavirus live events pilot scheme. Then in December, Cinderella was stopped due to 'Covid-related absences', alongside London productions of hit musicals Hamilton and The Lion King. At the time, Lloyd Webber said it is 'simply heartbreaking' to see the theatre industry 'decimated' by Omicron cancellations, adding 'no-one in the Government listens'. He postponed Cinderella until 2022 'to avoid more disruption' as the number of Covid-19 cases increased across the country. Written by The Crown star Emerald Fennell and starring Carrie Hope Fletcher, Cinderella is described as a 'complete reinvention' of the classic fairytale, and is based on an original idea by Fennell. The website for the show says anyone who has tickets booked for after 12 June will not lose their money.",

Parish announced his resignation as MP for Tiverton and Honiton on Saturday he was seen watching porn in parliament. The revelation was the latest in a series of reports about sexism and harassment in Westminster. Caroline Nokes, the Tory chair of the Commons women and equalities committee, has told The Times it would be a start if her party 'made sure' its candidate in the by-election was a woman. But Michelle Donelan rejected the idea of the party having an all-women shortlist in the seat. 'I've never been in favour of shortlists and quotas,' she told Sky News. 'We get more women in parliament by encouraging them, by breaking down barriers. 'We don't do it by putting in quotas which I find quite demeaning to women.' The minister said women could become MPs 'on merit', adding both female prime ministers had been Conservatives. Donelan added the MPs guilty of sexist or abusive behaviour were 'misogynistic dinosaurs'. Labour uses all-women shortlists in some seats to make sure more of its candidates are female. Current high-profile politicians -- including Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner and MPs Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy -- have all been selected under the system. Oliver Dowden, the Tory chairman, has said half of Conservative MPs should be women given 'half the population are women'. But the party has stopped short of using all-women shortlists to increase the number of women Tory MPs. Out of the 359 Conservatives, just 87 are women. But of Labour's 199 MPs, 104 are women and 95 are men. Cabinet minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan last week described once being 'pinned up against a wall' by a former MP. Attorney General Suella Braverman said some men in Westminster act like 'animals'. The Sunday Times reported drunken and disorderly behaviour, including a senior MP accused of repeatedly licking the faces of young male staff in parliamentary bars. A minister being overheard frequently having 'noisy sex' in his parliamentary office, an MP being warned over his use of prostitutes, and a female Tory being sent a 'dick pic' by a colleague were also reported. Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle has called for 'radical' reform to working practices in parliament. Hoyle suggested staff should no longer be employed by the parliamentarians they work for to address a series of 'serious allegations'.",

'How would you fit a giraffe into a fridge?' An asinine question in most settings, but especially peculiar during a job interview.  And yet, these kinds of 'quirky' and arbitrary lines of questioning seem to be commonplace during the interview process. In an attempt to make people think 'outside the box' or on their feet, hiring managers are coming up with increasingly difficult (and frustrating) tasks and questions for interviewees. And to make matters worse, many are leaving the applicants hanging once it comes to feedback or finding out the results of the conversation.  So, what does it say about their work culture when recruiting staff act like this when imbued with such powers? For starters, if you're being put in a difficult and tricky situation at the earliest stage of the job, then it might not be the best indication of the company's treatment of employees. And it also means they have no regard to the preparation that applicants may have completed in anticipation of a more traditional interview. After all, how does anyone answer how they'd put a giraffe in the fridge, or what words they'd have on their tombstone, or how they'd fare if locked in a room and asked to complete a challenge (all real requests)? Here are some of the most ridiculous requests people have received: It's understandable that companies would try get creative with their asks, and indeed some are known for tough brainteasers that showcase the best of people, but most of us can agree that some questions are just a bit bizarre and show nothing about the person.  That's what Hannah Langford, 31, from the North West, felt when she went for a job in law in Manchester. She tells HuffPost: 'I had a training contract interview at a law firm about 10 years ago and was asked two bizarre questions: 'Why don't polar bears eat penguins?' and 'How much water does it take to fill St Paul's Cathedral?'. 'These questions made me doubt myself and I felt confused as to what answer was expected (i.e., was I expected to give an actual answer to the water question or was my thought process what they were interested in?).' Langford ended up pivoting to a different sector altogether, deciding to work in charity.  Ramla*, 26, from London, can relate to navigating random questions that don't relate to the job. 'A charity that had many interview stages (and didn't even give feedback after despite saying it would) had some interesting questions,' she recalls. 'One was about who's your most problematic friend and why you are still friends with them. Another was about the last time you lost your temper. 'I'm not sure how far these questions really test someone's values. No matter what you say, they'd have to take it with a pinch of salt because it's an interview, not a chat with your best friend. 'These questions felt a bit like an interrogation. Surely what I've achieved and the places in which I've created transformative change should speak for itself - or at the very least, they could ask me directly about that?' Unfortunately, eccentric questioning seems to be commonplace in the job interview space, when that time could be far better utilised talking about the things that bring us joy, what we're passionate about, what we look forward to.  Because, truly, no one knows how to fit a giraffe into a fridge. And nor should they.  Life-Work Balance questions the status quo of work culture, its mental and physical impacts, and radically reimagines how we can change it to work for us.",

The senior MP said he felt he could not report it because he did not want to 'end up being part of the story'. The Commons Standards Committee chair said he was targeted by 'older, senior' men. His comments come after MPs' conduct was called into question amid a number of sexual misconduct allegations.  Bryant told LBC Radio: 'I remember when I came in, in 2001, I was regularly touched up by older, senior gay - well, they weren't out but - MPs. 'I never felt I was able to report it because you end up being part of the story, and that's the last thing you want. 'And I think a lot of women have been through that.'

Sir Lindsay Hoyle said a review is 'needed urgently' to examine the current structure whereby MPs employ their staff directly. It follows a spate of allegations by MPs and staff of bullying and sexual misconduct across the parliamentary estate. Hoyle's office said he was working with political parties and house authorities to establish a 'Speaker's Conference' as soon as possible to consider the problems. Made up of MPs, the committee would review current working practices and conditions, take expert advice and consider if there is a case for change. Sir Lindsay said: 'I take recent allegations of bullying and sexual impropriety, comments and advances very seriously, which is why it is time we reviewed our working practices, particularly whether it is right that individual MPs are the employers of their staff. 'The question is: should someone else - or an outside body - employ the staff, as long as the MP has the right to choose them?' The mechanism was last used in 2008 to provide advice on parliamentary representation and requires both the government and house to approve it.  Hoyle hopes the conference will reach cross-party agreement and make recommendations to the house on a case for change.

Just days after Rishi Sunak hinted oil and gas providers could face a tax on their bumper profits, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng slapped down the idea.  The government is facing calls to impose a levy on leading energy companies, as BP and Shell are expected to unveil big payouts for shareholders this week. Labour and the Lib Dems are both demanding a windfall tax on energy companies to help families struggling with the cost of living crisis. However, Kwasi Kwarteng criticised the idea, despite the Chancellor not ruling out such a move. Kwarteng told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: 'I've never been a supporter of windfall taxes, I've been very clear about that publicly. I think they discourage investment.' He described such a tax as 'arbitrary and unexpected' although he did refuse to rule out the government imposing one in future. Pressed on whether the government had ruled out a windfall tax, Kwarteng told the BBC: 'I am not going to be here on the programme ruling out what the Chancellor is going to do or isn't going to do in an October budget. That is not my job.' It comes after Sunak hinted at a possible U-turn on a tax on oil and gas providers, having repeatedly refused to consider the idea. He suggested that he would consider a windfall tax on the industry if it failed to ramp up investment in new energy projects. Speaking to Mumsnet, Sunak said he had not gone down the road of a windfall tax because he did not want to put off investment in new oil and gas extraction, highlighting a recent PS25 billion investment by one company in the North Sea. But he added: 'What I would say is that if we don't see that type of investment coming forward and companies are not going to make those investments in our country and energy security, then of course that's something I would look at and nothing is ever off the table in these things.' Kwarteng wrote to BP and Shell last week demanding a 'very clear plan' from them within weeks to reinvest profits. They are expected to present what is likely to be their best set of results for years while facing calls to cough up more in tax. They are predicted to report a combined PS10.5 billion in profit from the first three months of the financial year, a massive hike from the same time in 2021.

The presenter was sharing news of former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker's recent prison sentence when she got confused with the prime minister.  The former tennis world number one was jailed for two-and-a-half years for hiding PS2.5 million worth of assets and loans to avoid paying his debts on Friday. As Naga told Breakfast viewers about the news, she said: 'Three-times Wimbledon champion Boris Johnson has just spent his first night in prison.'

Becker was found guilty of four offences under the Insolvency Act between June 21 and October 3 2017 earlier this month.

He also failed to declare his share in a PS1 million property in his home town of Leimen, Germany, hid an 825,000 euro (almost PS700,000) bank loan - worth PS1.1 million with interest - and concealed 75,000 shares in a tech firm, valued at PS66,000.

The Labour leader flat out denied there was any agreement with the party, saying: 'Everybody knows there is no pact.' It comes after Tory chairman Oliver Dowden claimed Starmer was standing down candidates 'in swathes of the country' where Lib Dem support is strong to avoid splitting the anti-Tory vote. Dowden alleged Sir Ed Davey's party had returned the favour where Labour is dominant elsewhere. Asked about the claims, Starmer told Sky News: 'I wouldn't take anything Oliver Dowden says particularly seriously. 'The fact that he is spending his Sunday...attacking Labour...why doesn't he say something about the cost-of-living crisis for heaven's sake? 'There is no pact, everybody knows there is no pact. We will put a candidate up when there is a by-election, obviously after the Neil Parish resignation of yesterday.' Starmer went on to claim that Labour was standing more candidates than ever in the local elections. Davey also denied making a pact with Labour, saying: 'There is no pact now, there is not going to be a pact in the future.' It comes after HuffPost UK revealed the pressure Starmer is under to make gains at Thursday's election. One Labour source said: 'The big picture is we're going after the Conservatives and laying the groundwork for the next election.' A shadow minister added: 'I'm feeling pretty confident and optimistic. 'If we can't make gains now - with everything going on with the cost of living crisis and partygate - then there is something seriously wrong with us. 'The cost of living is seriously starting to bite, we've got middle class families with both parents in work having to rely on food banks. So this is affecting everyone.'",

The pair, whose characters' wedding was watched by 20 million UK viewers in 1988, have long been rumoured to return as part of the Aussie soap's send off.  It was announced earlier this year that the show would come to an end after 37 years on air.  In a statement, Neighbours' executive producer Jason Herbison said of the beloved 80s couple: 'Scott and Charlene are the ultimate Neighbours couple and it would not feel right to end the show without them. 'We are thrilled that Jason and Kylie have come home to play a very special part in our series finale. It has been an emotional experience for them, for us and I'm sure it will be for our viewers.' A post on the show's Instagram featured pictures of a Neighbours script with Scott and Charlene's names on, with Kylie and Jason also sharing their respective halves on their accounts.  The pair have yet to speak on reprising their roles, but the news has lit up Twitter... Earlier this year, it was revealed the future of the show was in jeopardy after UK broadcaster Channel 5 announced it would stop airing Neighbours from this summer. After the search for a new UK broadcast partner proved unsuccessful, it was confirmed the show would come to an end, with a statement saying: 'We are so sorry to say that after nearly 37 years and almost 9000 episodes broadcast we have to confirm that Neighbours will cease production in June. 'Following the loss of our key broadcast partner in the UK and despite an extensive search for alternative funding, we simply have no option but to rest the show. 'To our amazing, loyal fans, we know this is a huge disappointment, as it is to all of us on the team. We thank you for all your messages and support and promise to end the show on an incredible high.' Filming will wrap on 10 June, before the final episode airs on 1 August. Kylie and Jason, who made their last Neighbours appearances in 1988 and 1989 respectively, previously spoke out about the show's fate, with the Can't Get You Out Of My Head singer tweeting: 'I'll be forever grateful for the experience and the friends I made on Neighbours. 'We had no idea how big the show would become and how passionately viewers would take it to heart. Pure love!' She added: 'I can still hear Madge calling... CHARLENE!!!!' Over the years, Neighbours also helped launch the careers of many other Australian stars, including Natalie Imbruglia, Liam Hemsworth and two-time Oscar nominee Margot Robbie.",

You might think this friend is a bad influence because of the language they use, the way they treat other kids or speak to adults, or their attitude toward school. Maybe this friend has been mean, controlling or otherwise inconsiderate toward your child.  Whatever the reason, it can be a tricky issue to navigate. Below, parenting experts offer advice on how to handle the situation.  Do some self-reflection. First, take a little time to consider what exactly is rubbing you the wrong way about this friendship. Are your feelings warranted - or is it possible you're bringing your own baggage to the table?  'Do you dislike the child because of your personal values, prejudice or opinion?' Amy McCready, founder of Positive Parenting Solutions and author of The Me, Me, Me Epidemic, told HuffPost. 'Your child may be benefitting from this friendship or have more in common with the child than you may realise -- even if you wouldn't choose this friend for yourself.' Or perhaps your feelings toward this friend are misplaced. You think you don't like the kid when really, it's the parents you have an issue with.  'In today's charged political and social climate, parents can be faced with interacting with families that don't align with their views,' clinical psychologist Cindy T. Graham -- founder of Brighter Hope Wellness Center -- told HuffPost.  Ask your kid about the friendship Put aside your preconceived notions for a moment and have a conversation with your kid about this friend. Ask why they like hanging out with them and what they enjoy doing together. Be curious and listen to what they have to say. This requires an open heart and mind, Graham said.  'Aside from being a great opportunity to connect with your child, it gives you the chance to learn about aspects of the friend's personality, demeanour or circumstances that you may not have previously been aware of,' she said. 'For example, sometimes kids can present as immature or standoffish when under stressful situations,' Graham continued. 'Moments that trigger anxiety -- such as meeting unfamiliar adults -- can lead to behaviours that may be perceived as disrespectful.' Try also putting yourself in the kid's shoes. Think about the struggles they -- or their family -- might be facing that could be affecting their behaviour.  'Take into consideration what they may be going through or have gone through,' McCready said. 'Your own kid or family may be just what this child needs!'  Get to know the friend and their parents better Spend some time with the friend and their family -- it might show you a different side of them. Go into the experience hoping to see what your child sees in them.  'It's also helpful for the parent to be willing to get to know the family on a few different occasions,' Graham said. 'This will give everyone a greater chance of getting past the initial anxieties of making a good first impression to instead get to know one another.' Judge the behaviour, not the person If the friend in question does something you don't like, it's OK to tell your child that their behaviour concerned you. But resist making accusations or assumptions about the friend's character because of it.  'You can comment on a friend's behaviour that you disapprove of and help your child problem-solve why that behaviour may be something they shouldn't mimic,' McCready said. 'The bottom line: Judge the behaviour, not the person.'  If you think the friendship is a danger to your child, step in There's a difference between not being particularly fond of your kid's friend and feeling like this person could be a true threat to your child's safety or well-being. If it's the latter case, you should intervene immediately, McCready said.  'If you're concerned, set limits - without prohibiting the friendship,' she said. 'Keep a close eye on behaviours and offer your home as a hang-out spot to keep your eye on the kids, or set an earlier curfew when your child is hanging out with that friend.'  Look out for negative changes in your child's behaviour that could indicate the friendship is an unhealthy one. For your child, that might mean a worsening mood, a sudden change in their grades or withdrawing from activities they once enjoyed. If you notice any of these signs, 'then parents would want to look into the social dynamics with the friend more closely,' Graham said.  Talk about what it means to be a good friend. Use this situation as an opportunity to have conversations about what healthy friendships look and feel like. Discuss important qualities like trust, respect and standing up for one another.  'Highlight the differences in how you feel in a healthy friendship - inspired, accepted, safe, encouraged, hopeful, versus the emotions that come from unhealthy, toxic relationships - feeling anxious, disrespected, put out, pressured to do things you don't want to do, or like you're constantly in competition with your friend,' McCready said. Try to remember what it was like to be a kid yourself It's normal for kids and teens to go through different phases as they try to figure out who they are. 'Many kids who may have seemingly off-putting personalities are going through a phase that many of us go through,' Graham said. Consider this: When you were younger, perhaps you weren't always the kind of kid your friends' parents were thrilled about, either. Keeping that in mind 'could help you to be more kind towards your kids' friends,' Graham said.  Also, remember that your kids are growing up in a different time than you did.  'Often what was once considered unacceptable can change over time,' Graham added.  Keep things in perspective Friends come in and out of our kids' lives. Just because these two are buddy-buddy right now doesn't mean they're going to be inseparable forever (even if it feels that way).  'Understand that these may not be your child's friends for life and statistically, they probably won't be,' McCready said. 'According to a study, only one percent of friendships formed in middle school are still going strong by the 12th grade.' Agree to disagree It's a fact of life: you're not going to like everyone your kid is friends with, and that's OK. Sometimes an 'agree to disagree' approach is the best thing for the health of your relationship with your child. (As McCready pointed out, trying to forbid the friendship could create a power struggle between you and your child -- one that could push them away from you and closer to this friend.)  'There is a lot to be said for social relationships that allow a child to thrive and feel supported,' Graham said. 'As long as the friend isn't having a detrimental effect on your child, it may be best to accept that you may not always like your child's choices, including their friendships.' And remember: Even not-great friendships can turn out to be positive learning experiences for your kid. For example, it may help them figure out which qualities they value in a friend or teach them how to set and hold boundaries.  'Friendships that are less-than-ideal aren't necessarily a recipe for disaster or a path to trouble,' McCready said. 'With your open mind and willingness to offer counsel, your kids will navigate friendships with the proper support.'  This is part of a HuffPost Parents series called Enjoy the Ride. Read more here.

    "fd4292a5d3fd8d6a592ed0fdaab8d2f010780285419bd43484a5b5bd": "At this point of the pandemic, it still feels like we're stuck in a bit of a time warp.   Yes, offices are opening back up and many people are carrying on with their events and travel plans. But there's still a layer of uncertainty about what might happen next with Covid and when the pandemic will truly end -- especially as more variants pop up. Life doesn't exactly feel normal yet, and as a result, time drags by. Here's why, and how you can 'gain' some of it back: 1. We lost our routines. According to Ruth Ogden, an experimental psychologist at Liverpool John Moores University who studies how humans process time, this sensation that time is warped has been a global phenomenon. Through her research, she's found that people across the globe have experienced distorted time during the pandemic.  The biggest culprit of the time warp: the loss of our routines. 'All the things in our day that helped us know what time it was -- they were gone. That meant it became easy for time to slip and slide around,' Ogden said. During the pandemic, time stood still for many of us. We canceled our activities and we distanced from friends. People did everything -- sleep, eat, work, socialise, parent, exercise -- from their homes.  'We're all heavily routinised creatures, but this routine is important because it keeps us in time,' Ogden said.  Our day-to-day activities help us perceive time -- if we are commuting, we know it's morning, if we're running out for lunch, it's midday, and so on and so forth. Without daily routines, which act as markers of time, it becomes easy to get lost in time. The things that made your Saturday a Saturday, or your Tuesday a Tuesday, may no longer be there. Research also suggests that emotions significantly impact our perception of time. When we're happy and physiologically aroused, time feels like it's flying by; conversely, depression can make time feel sluggish.  Furthermore, our expectations of how things will occur (i.e., the pandemic is over!) versus the reality of how things play out (there's a new variant coming for us) can make time feel faster or slower, depending on if the actual outcome was better or worse than our predictions.  2. Memories help us process time, and our memories are different from the last few years. Think back to the beginning of the pandemic, when news of Covid spreading around China first leaked. How long ago does that feel to you? Months? Years? It's probably hard to tell.  Ogden and her research team have been studying how people feel about the length of the pandemic and have discovered that the brain processes length of time through memories.  'If we've got loads of memories, then it says, 'Oh, it must have been a long time,' but if it has very few memories, then we think it must have been a short period of time,' Ogden said.  In theory, most of us should remember the pandemic as being short -- because we didn't do a lot, Ogden said. But she's found the opposite: most people feel like we've been stuck in the pandemic for much longer than we have been.  The reason, it seems, is that while we didn't necessarily form a ton of fun, new memories for a period of time, we still formed memories. We learned how to bake bread, we got into puzzles and crafts and packed our days with Zoom meetings. We navigated life through restrictions, masking and distancing; we developed new skills and fell into new routines. Time moved forward.  3. People process time differently. Just how distorted time feels varies from person to person. It ultimately depends each person's personal experience with Covid and how much the pandemic has influenced or changed their daily activities, said Nicole Dudukovic, the director of the neuroscience major at the University of Oregon. Ogden's research, for example, has found that social satisfaction is one of the biggest factors behind how people process time.  'The more socially satisfied you were, the 'quicker' the pandemic went,' Ogden said, noting that this didn't just involve being around people, like family in your household, but seeking out and enjoying social connections.  People who have engaged in 'normal life' again, and are traveling and commuting to the office and engaged in activities, are probably going to have a more normal sense of time right now. People who are at-risk and are hunkering down, along with those who are stressed about returning to pre-pandemic activities, may continue to feel disoriented about time.  'For some people, this experience will continue for a long time and that will continue to cause distortion to their experience of time,' Ogden said.  4. We're more aware of time now. Ultimately, the pandemic has made people much more aware of time. We've had more time on our hands, which has caused us to become hyper aware of time and how it's passing, Ogden said.  At the same time, we often don't remember time accurately. It's very hard for people to remember how we felt about things, like time, in the past -- it's largely influenced by how we feel about things now. Memories of how time once passed can be very inaccurate, according to Dudukovic. While it may feel like time is passing differently now, it's totally plausible that we're just misremembering how time felt pre-pandemic. 'It's possible that if you'd asked me in 2019 about how fast time was going that maybe it would be not that different from how I'm feeling about it now,' Dudukovic said.  Here's how to overcome the time warp. Ogden said it's important to recognise that we are not going to return to life before the pandemic.  'So much in the world has changed as a result of the pandemic,' she said. We've carried on and adapted to new ways of work and socialising.  One of the best ways to mitigate the feeling that we're stuck in a time warp is to create new routines.  'There's a lot of evidence to suggest that your routine, and also the number of activities that you're engaged in, that that's going to influence how you're perceiving time,' Dudukovic said.  Changing your environments -- stepping out of the house, going on walks, or even switching up the room you work in -- can trick your brain into thinking more is happening, so that time passes more regularly.  If your days blend together, save certain activities and routines for specific days of the week. 'Make your Tuesday a Tuesday because of the things you do in it,' Ogden said.  Finally, try to keep busy. The busier we are, the less we tend to focus on how time is passing. ",

Neil Parish admitted to the BBC on Saturday that he watched adult material parliament, claiming the first time was accidental after looking at tractors online. The select committee chairman had initially vowed to continue as MP for Tiverton and Honiton but said he would quit after recognising the 'furore' and 'damage' he was causing his family and constituency. The 65-year-old former farmer, who was first elected in 2010, said: 'The situation was, funnily enough it was tractors I was looking at, so I did get into another website with sort of a very similar name and I watched it for a bit, which I shouldn't have done. 'My crime, my most biggest crime, is that on another occasion I went in a second time, and that was deliberate. 'That was sitting waiting to vote on the side of the chamber.' In a statement, his local Conservative association in Tiverton and Honiton, Devon, said: 'We would like to take this opportunity to thank Neil Parish for his service to our communities over the past 12 years. 'We support his decision to step down as our Member of Parliament.' It means a by-election will be held in his seat - which Parish retained for the Tories at the last election with a majority of 24,239 - later this year. Tory chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris suspended Parish from the parliamentary Conservative Party on Friday afternoon - three days after female Tory MPs first raised complaints of a male colleague watching porn on his phone in the Commons chamber. Parish, a 65-year-old farmer, said he had referred himself to parliamentary commissioner for standards Kathryn Stone. On Friday afternoon, the rural affairs committee chairman said he would be continuing his 'duties' as an MP while 'cooperating fully' with investigators. He also suggested that he had opened the pornography on his phone accidentally.  His wife Sue Parish said 'it was all very embarrassing' as she told the Times she was not aware of her husband having done similar activities before. 'No. He's quite a normal guy, really. He's a lovely person. It's just so stupid,' she said.  Before being identified as the MP at the centre of the storm, Parish was asked about the allegations during an appearance on GB News earlier this week. He was non-committal on whether the suspect should have the whip removed and denied there was a large cultural problem in Westminster, despite senior Conservative colleagues having decried it as being 'shameful'. 'We've got some 650 members of parliament in what is a very intense area,' Mr Parish said. 'We are going to get people that step over the line. I don't think there's necessarily a huge culture here but I think it does have to be dealt with and dealt with seriously and that's what the whips will do.' The pornography claims followed reports that 56 MPs, including three Cabinet ministers, are facing allegations of sexual misconduct that have been referred to the ICGS. They also follow outrage over The Mail On Sunday publishing 'sexist' and disputed claims from unnamed Tory MPs that deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner tried to distract Boris Johnson with her legs during PMQs.

Earlier this month, The Sun published an article claiming Big Brother could be returning to our screens as soon as 2023, with a brand new home on ITV2.    The tabloid quoted 'a TV source' who said that ITV was 'in talks' about potentially reviving the game-changing reality show.  In a new interview with the Daily Star, Davina said she 'really hopes' to see Big Brother back on our screens. She said: '[The prospect of] Big Brother returning is very exciting. I mean, I really, really hope it comes back, and I think if it's coming back to ITV2 then that is a really good home for it.

    "ac1ed30fc29bda18df1fbbcbe5f7a4c371b121f038056ecad2dd8229": "Three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker has been jailed for two-and-a-half years for hiding PS2.5 million worth of assets and loans to avoid paying his debts. The former world number one, 54, was declared bankrupt on June 21 2017, owing creditors almost PS50 million, over an unpaid loan of more than PS3 million on his estate in Mallorca, Spain. BBC commentator Becker transferred almost 427,000 euros (around PS390,000) from his business account to others, including those of his ex-wife Barbara and estranged wife Sharlely 'Lilly' Becker.   The father-of-four also failed to declare his share in a PS1 million property in his home town of Leimen, Germany, hid an 825,000 euro (almost PS700,000) bank loan - worth PS1.1 million with interest - and concealed 75,000 shares in a tech firm, valued at PS66,000. Becker, who was handed a two-year suspended sentence for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion worth 1.7 million euro (around PS1.4 million) in Germany in 2002, was found guilty of four offences under the Insolvency Act between June 21 and October 3 2017 earlier this month. Judge Deborah Taylor sentenced the six-time Grand Slam champion to two-and-a-half years imprisonment, of which he will serve half, at Southwark Crown Court on Friday. Referring to his previous conviction, the judge said: 'You did not heed the warning you were given and the chance you were given by the suspended sentence and that is a significant aggravating factor.' She told Becker: 'I take into account what has been described as your fall from grace. 'You have lost your career and reputation and all of your property as a result of your bankruptcy.' But she added: 'You have not shown remorse, acceptance of your guilt and have sought to distance yourself from your offending and your bankruptcy.   'While I accept your humiliation as part of the proceedings, there has been no humility.' Becker, wearing a striped tie in the Wimbledon colours of purple and green, tied his shoelaces on his black Puma trainers but showed no emotion as he picked up his Puma bag before being taken down to the cells. He earlier arrived holding the hand of partner Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro, while his eldest son Noah was also in court. Following his retirement, the tennis star has coached current world number one tennis player Novak Djokovic, worked as a TV sports commentator for broadcasters including the BBC and acted as a brand ambassador for firms such as Puma. His barrister Jonathan Laidlaw QC said the tennis star's 'fall from grace' was 'the most public humiliation'. 'Boris Becker has literally nothing and there is also nothing to show for what was the most glittering of sporting careers and that is correctly termed as nothing short of a tragedy,' he said. 'These proceedings have destroyed his career entirely and ruined any further prospect of earning an income.   'His reputation is in tatters. 'He will not be able to find work and will have to rely on the charity of others if he is to survive.' Becker told jurors his 50 million US dollar (about PS38 million) career earnings were swallowed up by an expensive divorce to his first wife Barbara, child maintenance payments and 'expensive lifestyle commitments'. The German national, who has lived in the UK since 2012, said he was 'shocked' and 'embarrassed' when he was declared bankrupt. He claimed he had co-operated with trustees tasked with securing his assets, even offering up his wedding ring, and relied on the advisers who managed his life. However, Becker was found guilty of four charges, including removal of property, two counts of failing to disclose estate and concealing debt. Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said the jury had found he acted 'deliberately and dishonestly' but added: 'Even now, Mr Becker is still seeking to blame others when it was obviously his duty.' The court heard he received 1.13 million euros (about PS950,000) from the sale of a Mercedes car dealership he owned in Germany into a business account used as his 'piggy bank' for his personal expenses. They included PS7,600 on children's school fees, almost PS1,000 at Harrods, and payments made to Ralph Lauren, Porsche, Ocado and a Chelsea children's club.   He also paid 48,000 euros (around PS40,000) for an ankle operation at a private Swiss clinic and spent 6,000 euros (around PS5,000) at a luxury golf resort in China, the court heard. Becker was acquitted of 20 charges, including nine counts of failing to hand over trophies and medals from his tennis career. He said he did not know the whereabouts of the memorabilia, including the 1985 Wimbledon title that catapulted him to stardom, aged 17. Becker was also cleared of failing to declare a second German property, as well as his interest in the PS2.5 million Chelsea flat occupied by his daughter Anna Ermakova, who was conceived during Becker's infamous sexual encounter with waitress Angela Ermakova at London restaurant Nobu in 1999. Mr Laidlaw said Becker had not spent money on a 'lavish lifestyle' but used funds to pay child maintenance, lawyers, business expenses and rent. 'He was in desperate financial straits and what in essence he has done is exercised his own choice as to which creditors to pay, choosing or preferring to my monies to dependents rather than allowing the joint trustees to determine how those monies should be applied,' he added.",

    "d0afb20d66b8df9bb79b78160d12ee86f3fe67bd4da2a59e5f47a9e3": "The received Westminster wisdom is that the local elections are do-or-die for Boris Johnson. After months of awful headlines about partygate, and with the mood among Tory MPs once again turning fractious, a bad night for the Conservatives next Thursday may well be the trigger for a move to unseat the prime minister. What is less discussed, however, is how the elections are also a key test for Keir Starmer and whether he has what it takes to lead Labour to victory at the general election in two years' time. With a new poll yesterday giving Labour a nine-point lead over the Conservatives, expectations are high that the party is set to make sweeping gains on Thursday. But Starmer's internal detractors are looking for any signs that the party is stalling to confirm their suspicions that he is failing to seal the deal with voters. Here, HuffPost UK assesses where the main parties are ahead of a crucial night on May 5. The State Of The Parties A total of 6,812 council seats in England, Wales and Scotland are up for grabs on Thursday. In addition, there are also mayoral elections in South Yorkshire, Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets, Watford and Croydon, as well as the Northern Ireland Assembly election. In England, the Tories are defending 1,404 seats, Labour 2,222 and the Lib Dems 517. The rest are held by independents. In Wales, Labour hold 462 council seats, with Plaid Cymru on 208, the Conservatives on 197 and the Lib Dems on 59. More than 300 seats are held by independents. And in Scotland, the SNP have 432 seats, with the Tories second on 277, Labour on 262 and the Lib Dems on 67. Nearly 200 of Scottish councillors are independents. What's At Stake? An awful lot more than which parties will be responsible for your bin collections for the next four years. With a general election expected in 2024, this is likely to be the last big electoral test that Labour and the Tories will face before then. As such, it will act as an important barometer of the national mood and indicate which parties, if any, are starting to build up momentum as the general election draws nearer. Johnson needs to prove to his restive MPs that he is still the election winning-machine who delivered an 80-seat majority in 2019, and that the damage done to his reputation by partygate is not terminal. The stakes are arguably even higher for Starmer who, two years after becoming Labour leader, has still to convince the public that he has what it takes to lead the country. Is Starmer's Labour Working? While Labour has established a consistent poll lead in recent months, there remains a strong suspicion that it owes more to the public's dissatisfaction with the Conservatives than any great enthusiasm for the Starmer project. HuffPost UK revealed this week that the Labour leader is facing internal pressure to show voters how the party would tackle the cost of living crisis rather than focusing on the partygate scandal. At a shadow cabinet meeting, communities spokesperson Lisa Nandy said Labour risked looking 'out of touch' at a time when families across the country are struggling to make ends meet. One senior frontbencher said: 'Lisa's not alone on this. There was strong agreement in the room to focus on the cost of living.' It's clear, therefore, that Starmer's critics will be scrutinising Thursday's results to try and assess whether the public support the leader's strategy or are yet to be convinced.  What Does Success Look Like? The main problem facing Labour is that the last time these council seats were up for grabs four years ago, the party did very well, making it harder for them to make sweeping gains this time around. That said, a failure to pick up a significant number of council seats, and at least show progress in the Red Wall areas the party needs to win back if it's to stand any chance of winning in 2024, will constitute a disappointing evening for Starmer. 'It's a strange set of elections,' said one Starmer ally. '2018 was a bad night for the Tories and a very, very good one for Labour. 'So another bad night for the Tories and a good night for us isn't going to result in a lot of exciting change.' As polling gurus Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher summed up the situation in a recent article: '[Labour] will do well to avoid making standing still rather than picking up gains seem rather underwhelming when the post-mortem takes place. 'For the Conservatives, by contrast, the less dramatic the results, the more they can claim not to be suffering traditional 'mid-term blues'.' Labour sources are attempting to play down the prospect of the party seizing totemic Tory councils like Westminster and Wandsworth, but they admit that winning back Barnet is a distinct possibility. Beating the Tories into second place behind the SNP is also essential if the party is to have any hope of re-establishing an electoral foothold in its former Scottish heartland. Just as important as winning more council seats, insiders say, are signs of progress in seats currently held by the Tories in England and the SNP north of the border. 'We are also tracking where we are in about about 50-70 constituencies that would put us in government at a general election, so we will be keeping an eye on them on Thursday,' said a Labour source. 'Places like Stevenage, Wakefield, Bury and Glasgow.  'We need to beat the Tories and SNP in them.' The Tory View Unsurprisingly, the Conservatives are keen to raise the bar as high as possible for what would constitute a good night for Labour in the hope they will come nowhere near clearing it. One Tory source told HuffPost UK: 'Labour are obviously saying how difficult it's going to be to improve on 2018, but the reality is they are ahead in the polls and so should be doing well. 'It's going to be very difficult for us in certain places, especially central London and in places like Wandsworth, Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, where the demographics are turning against us. 'Outer London is a bit better, but things are also going to be difficult in the affluent south - places like Surrey and West Oxfordshire, where Labour are doing well.' Significantly, however, the Tories are more confident of holding off Labour in the Red Wall, where partygate is not the major political issue many at Westminster believe it is. 'The question for Labour is whether they can make adequate progress in the places they lost in 2019 and need to win back next time,' the source said. 'While those voters are bothered about partygate, they're more concerned with bread and butter issues such as the cost of living. They're pissed off with the PM about partygate, but they also like what we did on vaccines and furlough.' Winning Here? Like Labour, the Lib Dems performed well in 2018, making further progress more difficult this time around.  'What we're really looking to is consolidate the gains we made in places like South Cambridgeshire, Richmond and Kingston,' a source told HuffPost UK. 'If we hold our ground and edge forward a little in other areas, it should spook a few Tory MPs.' These include Stephen Hammond in Wimbledon, where the Lib Dems launched their local election campaign. The party also wants to make progress in Wokingham, where the local MP is one Dominic Raab. The source added: 'The big picture is we're going after the Conservatives and laying the groundwork for the next election.'  The Pestminster Factor In the past week alone, unnamed Tory MPs have smeared Angela Rayner by accusing her of using her legs to distract Boris Johnson, while another has been suspended by the party for allegedly watching porn in the Commons. The timing could hardly have been worse for the Conservatives. Will voters use their ballots to register their disgust at the latest examples of Tory sleaze? Keir Starmer and Labour certainly hope so. ",

The select committee chairman said he would be continuing his 'duties' as an MP for Tiverton and Honiton, in Devon, while 'cooperating fully' with investigators after he had the Tory whip suspended on Friday. Asked by broadcasters if he opened something in error in the Commons, he said: 'I did, but let the inquiry look at that.' Parish, a 65-year-old farmer, said he would only consider his position after the conclusion of an inquiry, having earlier been revealed to be the subject of the allegations, ending days of speculation after the claims surfaced during a meeting of Tory MPs on Tuesday. He told reporters: 'I will not remain if I am found guilty.' Parish said he told his wife on Friday afternoon, adding: 'Of course it's embarrassing and it's embarrassing for my wife and family, so that's my main concern at the moment.' His wife Sue Parish said 'it was all very embarrassing' as she told the Times she was not aware of her husband having done similar activities before. 'No. He's quite a normal guy, really. He's a lovely person. It's just so stupid,' she said. Parish, a 65-year-old farmer, said he had referred himself to parliamentary commissioner for standards Kathryn Stone over 'an MP's use of their mobile phone in parliament'. But he vowed to continue serving his constituents and remain chairman of the rural affairs Committee despite calls to resign or at least stop attending the Commons while under investigation. 'I will be cooperating fully with any investigation, and whilst it is ongoing I will continue to perform my duties as MP for Tiverton and Honiton,' he wrote on his website.   Conservative chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris suspended Parish, who has represented his constituency since 2010, from the parliamentary Conservative Party after they talked on Friday afternoon. 'Mr Parish has been suspended from the Conservative whip pending the outcome of that investigation,' a spokesperson for Mr Heaton-Harris said. First the Tories looked to refer the matter to the independent complaints and grievance scheme, which looks into claims of bullying and sexual harassment. It is understood that process has now started after at least one witness made a referral. But a second investigation could be launched after Parish's commitment to refer himself to Stone. It was unclear what potential breach of the MPs' code of conduct he would report himself for. But it is thought one line of inquiry could be whether Parish caused 'significant damage to the reputation and integrity' of the Commons. Before being identified as the MP at the centre of the storm, Parish was asked about the allegations during an appearance on GB News earlier this week.   He was non-committal on whether the suspect should have the whip removed and denied there was a large cultural problem in Westminster, despite senior Conservative colleagues having decried it as being 'shameful'. 'We've got some 650 members of parliament in what is a very intense area,' Mr Parish said. 'We are going to get people that step over the line. I don't think there's necessarily a huge culture here but I think it does have to be dealt with and dealt with seriously and that's what the whips will do.' The pornography claims followed reports that 56 MPs, including three Cabinet ministers, are facing allegations of sexual misconduct that have been referred to the ICGS. They also follow outrage over The Mail On Sunday publishing 'sexist' and disputed claims from unnamed Tory MPs that deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner tried to distract Boris Johnson with her legs during prime minister's Questions.",

A spokesperson for the Tory chief whip has said Parish has had the Conservative whip suspended while he is being investigated. A spokeswoman for Chris Heaton-Harris said: 'Having spoken to the chief whip this afternoon, Neil Parish MP is reporting himself to the parliamentary commissioner for standards. 'Mr Parish has been suspended from the Conservative whip pending the outcome of that investigation.' Parish, a farmer from Somerset who chairs the rural affairs select committee of MPs, was elected to the safe Devon seat of Tiverton and Honiton in 2010 after a decade in the European Parliament as an MEP. In a statement, he said: 'Following recent allegations regarding an MP's use of their mobile phone in Parliament, I have referred myself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards in the House of Commons. 'I will be cooperating fully with any investigation, and whilst it is ongoing I will continue to perform my duties as MP for Tiverton and Honiton. 'I will not be making further comments at this stage.' Parish later suggested he may have accidentally opened a pornographic video in the Commons and said he will quit as an MP if found guilty. Asked if he opened something by error in the Commons, he told broadcasters: 'I did, but let the inquiry look at that. 'I will await the findings of the inquiry and then I will consider my position. I will not remain if I am found guilty.' He said he told his wife on Friday afternoon, adding: 'Of course it's embarrassing and it's embarrassing for my wife and family so that's my main concern at the moment.' Labour said the Tories had known about Parish's alleged conduct for days, but had done nothing about it. Thangam Debbonaire, Labour's shadow leader of the House of Commons, said: 'The Conservatives knew for days about the disgusting behaviour of one of their MPs and tried to cover it up. 'From the Owen Paterson scandal to their failure to act against their paedophile MP Imran Ahmad Khan, this is a government rotting from the head down. Britain deserves better.' Earlier in the week, Parish appeared on GB News before his name was made public, where he was asked about the incident. He was asked whether the MP in question should have the whip removed, and responded: 'I think the whips office will do a thorough investigation and we will wait and see that result and I think from that then the decision will have to be made what action will be taken. He then denied there was a large cultural problem in Westminster, despite senior Conservative colleagues having decried it as being 'shameful'.

It was unclear what potential breach of the MPs' code of conduct he would report himself for. But it is thought one investigation for parliamentary commissioner for standards Kathryn Stone could be whether Parish caused 'significant damage to the reputation and integrity' of the Commons. The Liberal Democrats have called on Boris Johnson to demand the resignation of Parish following his suspension from the Tory whip. Deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: 'If Boris Johnson had any shred of decency left, he would tell Neil Parish to resign immediately. 'In any other workplace this would count as gross misconduct and the person responsible would lose their job. Parliament should be no different. 'We don't need to insult the women MPs who witnessed this with a lengthy investigation. All his bosses need to do is ask for his devices and look at his viewing history, this isn't rocket science.'",

    "a0248ca0fdbfc9fd003d4b39e45b35e2c116d0a11a83941fa7bf565c": "Tory local election candidates are leaving Boris Johnson off their campaign leaflets amid fears they could be tainted by his unpopularity with voters, HuffPost UK has learned. Conservative hopefuls across the country have chosen not to use the prime minister's image as his poll ratings plummet. Many are promoting themselves as 'local Conservatives' as a way of trying to distance themselves from the national party's woes. A new poll by Survation this morning gave Labour a nine-point lead over the Tories, with partygate and the cost of living crisis taking their toll on the government's fortunes. Voters across the UK will go to the polls on May 5 in what will be a key test for all the party leaders with the general election due in just two years' time. Speculation is mounting that a particularly bad night for the Conservatives could see moves to remove Johnson as leader In Ealing, 12 Tory leaflets have been sent out without using a single picture of the prime minister. In North Tyneside, local Conservative candidates have even ditched the traditional Tory blue and are urging voters to 'go green'.  Meanwhile, in Tynemouth, Conservatives are calling themselves 'local councillors' and issuing leaflets in Labour red in an apparent attempt to disassociate themselves from their own party. Leaflets being put through voters' doors in Redbridge feature pictures of local MP and former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith rather than Johnson. And in Leeds, the Conservative leader on the city council makes no mention of the party on his mailshot to voters. Other areas where the PM's image is notable by its absence include Bromley,Southampton, Reading, Lewisham and Tunbridge Wells. Shabana Mahmood MP, Labour's elections co-ordinator, said: 'From Exeter to Tyneside, you can't find a single Tory leaflet with Boris Johnson's face on it. 'But pretending the PM doesn't exist can't help them hide from his disastrous handling of the cost of living crisis, which will see households across the country PS2620 worse off this year.'

Party whips are under increasing pressure to suspend the MP but have so far left allegations to be dealt with by an independent complaints process.  The probe, by the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), could last for years and will allow the accused MP to remain anonymous.  Now the party is facing accusations that it is 'shamelessly' dragging its feet and 'hiding behind process'. Anneliese Dodds, chair of the Labour Party, said it was 'inexplicable' that the Conservative Party was 'refusing to take action' against their MP. 'The Conservatives already know who this person is,' she added. 'If this happened in any other workplace they'd be sacked. Boris Johnson needs to take action today.' Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem women and equalities spokesperson, said: 'The Conservatives are shamelessly dragging their feet. They would rather hide behind process and allow this toxic behaviour to go unpunished instead of standing up for women. 'Enough is enough. Tory whips know who did it - they need to stop protecting him and come clean on who it is so he can face justice.' One Tory MP Nickie Aiken said the individual should resign because they were causing 'pain, suffering and embarrassment' to the Tory party and parliament.  Meanwhile, her colleague Caroline Nokes said she was 'disappointed' that party whips had not already suspended him. The chair of the women and equalities select committee told PoliticsHome the decision to refer the allegations to the ICGS showed the government was 'kicking it into the long grass'. It comes after separate claims that 56 MPs are currently facing sexual misconduct investigations, including three cabinet ministers and two shadow cabinet ministers. Asked about sexism she had faced in parliament, cabinet minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan today revealed she was once pinned up against a wall by a male MP. She told LBC some of the sexism she had faced included: 'A number of years ago being pinned up against a wall by a male MP who is now no longer in the house, I'm pleased to say, declaring that I must want him because he was a powerful man.'  The Tory party's chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris has called for the case to be referred to parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) which investigates allegations of harassment and sexual misconduct.   The disciplinary process could lead to a recommendation that the MP is suspended or forced out of the commons if a complaint is upheld.  The Conservative Party has been approached for comment. ",

Often unprovoked, the couple share details of their relationship that we didn't ask for. Recently Fox shared that they occasionally drink each other's blood.   Fox announced the engagement -- and the blood consumption -- in an Instagram post in January. There was immediate outcry from various medical experts like Dr Shikha Jain, a Chicago-based haematologist and oncologist.  Jain told Glamour UK back in January that 'it is absolutely not safe to drink other people's blood'. The doctor added that there's a risk of contracting a blood-borne pathogen or infection.   Now, Fox says she probably didn't give people an accurate description of the blood-drinking process. 'So, I guess to drink each other's blood might mislead people or people are imagining us with goblets and we're like 'Game of Thrones' drinking each other's blood,' she told the magazine. She said the amount of blood they drink from each other is 'just a few drops,' but admitted: 'We do consume each other's blood on occasion for ritual purposes only.'  It might sound a little unique, but we don't want to kink-shame now. After all, kissing on the mouth and swapping saliva would be considered gross in some other cultures. Also, there's a whole vampirisim community who practice this ritual. But in case you're wondering, are there any medical effects of consuming someone else's blood? We found out.  Giulia Guerrini, a health practitioner at digital pharmacy Medino, commented that it's not the first time vampirism has been in the spotlight. 'Just like before thanks to the craze of Twilight, Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly have brought vampirism into the spotlight. If you also like to perform Wicca rituals like this or participate in consensual vampirism as part of sex play, there's no shame - but like with most kinks, anyone with a desire to participate or already actively participating should be aware of all the potential risks involved. Drinking someone else's blood can be very dangerous.' Guerrini mentions that there are some conditions to be aware of, no matter how little the risk. 'There's an incredibly serious risk of contracting a blood-borne disease by drinking your partner's blood. I wouldn't recommend drinking your partner or anyone else's blood, but if you want to do it anyway, at least seek medical assurances first that they (and you, if it's being reciprocated!) aren't carrying any blood-borne diseases. HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, malaria and syphilis are all potentially life-threatening and not fun to deal with.' She says there are other conditions to be aware of such as haemochromatosis, which occurs when you intake too much iron. Our bodies struggle to naturally discard any excess iron, and human blood is very rich in iron. 'Drinking a few drops of human blood is unlikely to cause haemochromatosis, but keep in mind that haemochromatosis can cause damage to your endocrine glands, heart, joints, liver and pancreas, as well as dehydration and low blood pressure. It can also cause fluid to accumulate in your lungs.' There are other rarer conditions too, to be mindful of. 'Clinically, there's also the rare mental health condition of Renfield Syndrome, which is conveniently named after the fictional character R. M. Renfield in the Dracula novel. Renfield Syndrome is a compulsive order where you believe that you have a biological need to drink animal or human blood in order to maintain your health and vitality.' Whatever your kinks, just make sure it's, safe, consensual and appealing to all involved. ",

The comedian and presenter announced in 2021 that the then-upcoming season of her show would be the last, saying at the time she felt she needed 'something new to challenge me'. Her announcement came after a year of controversy over an alleged toxic workplace environment, though she has maintained this was not the reason for ending her show. On Thursday, Ellen posted a snap of herself on set on her Instagram page, writing: 'Today we taped the final episode of The Ellen Show which airs on 26 May. 'When we started this show in 2003, the iPhone didn't exist. Social Media didn't exist. Gay marriage wasn't legal. We watched the world change, sometimes for the better, sometimes not. 'But whatever was happening, my goal was always for the show to be a place where we could all come together and laugh for an hour.' She continued: 'Being invited into your lives has been the greatest privilege of my life and has brought me incredible joy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.' Ellen previously said of her decision to end The Ellen Show: 'It's going to be really hard on the last day, but I also know it's time. I'm a creative person, and when you're a creative person you constantly need to be challenged, which is why I decided to host the Oscars or why I decided to go back to stand-up when I didn't think I would. 'I just needed something to challenge me. And as great as this show is, and as fun as it is, it's just not a challenge anymore. I need something new to challenge me.' The news came in the wake of July 2020 reports of a 'toxic' work culture on the show. BuzzFeed News spoke with 36 anonymous ex-staffers, all of whom shared stories of the improper treatment they experienced or witnessed on set. Three producers left the show amid the allegations of 'sexual misconduct and racially insensitive remarks'. Ellen apologised to staff after an internal review by Warner Bros found 'deficiencies related to the show's day-to-day management'. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Ellen insisted these allegations didn't impact the show or the decision to end it, but that they 'almost' did. 'It was very hurtful to me. I mean, very,' she said. 'But if I was quitting the show because of that, I wouldn't have come back this season.'",

On Thursday evening, James confirmed his plans to step down as host of the US talk show in 2023 - with some fans rushing to point out that this was the same year a new series of Doctor Who would be launching, with a new actor in the lead role. This speculation was then bolstered by James' fellow US talk show host Stephen Colbert, who tweeted: 'Congratulations, James, on what will be eight incredible years at CBS. 12:30 won't be the same without you. 'But looking forward to your exciting adventures as the new Doctor Who!'  Talk about stirring the pot. While many interpreted Stephen's comments as a joke, others took it more seriously, leading to quite the reaction from fans - both for and against the possibility of James taking over at the helm of the Tardis... HuffPost UK contacted James' representatives for comment, who had no official statement, but suggested Stephen's tweet had been intended as a joke. James has actually appeared in two episodes of the BBC sci-fi show in the past, playing Craig Owens, a flatmate of Matt Smith's Doctor. Announcing his exit from The Late, Late Show on Thursday evening, James said: 'Seven and half years ago I started hosting this show and there's no other way to put it, it has changed my life. 'I love it, I love all the people that work here, I am so proud of what we've achieved, it's been beyond my wildest, wildest dreams. When I started this journey it was always going to be just that, a journey, an adventure. 'I never saw as it as my final destination, and I never want this show to overstay its welcome, I love making it and I really think in a year from now that will be a good time to move on and see what's out there.' He will step down as host for good in the summer of 2023. During his tenure as host, he's interviewed a range of A-list celebrities, had former First Lady Michelle Obama appear in a comedy sketch and made his recurring Carpool Karaoke skits a viral sensation. Other stars to have already ruled themselves out as the next Doctor include Years & Years singer Olly Alexander and British acting legend Hugh Grant.",

Turns out you might not need as much as you think. According to a major new study by Cambridge University, the magic number for good health is actually seven hours a night - not more, not less. The research, which looked at nearly 500,000 adults between the ages of 38 and 73, found that getting too much sleep - as well as too little - was linked with worse mental health, such as anxiety and depression, as well as poorer brain performance. Those who got seven hours a night performed best in tests that required memory and problem-solving, visual attention and speed processing. 'For every hour that you moved away from seven hours you got worse,' said Barbara Sahakian, Professor of Clinical Neuropsychology at Cambridge University, of the research findings. Scientists looked at brain imaging and genetic data from the UK Biobank for 40,000 participants and found the key to good sleep was consistency. In participants who got too much or little sleep, the part of the brain that included the hippocampus, which deals in memory, was found to be smaller. 'It's very clear that the processes that go on in our brain during sleep are very important for maintaining our physical and mental health,' said Prof. Sahakian. Whatever our age, sleep is 'as important as exercise' for good health, she added, but especially as we get older.",

'For Kit, being an addict, it's very important for him to recognise himself as such,' Rose told Harper's Bazaar UK . 'The AA community has provided such a loving space for him to feel heard, to make sure he's not alone,' she continued. 'But if it weren't for rehab, he would be in a very different headspace right now.' Rose and Kit married in 2018. He sought treatment in 2019 following the end of Game Of Thrones, the HBO fantasy drama that propelled both of them to worldwide fame. The couple welcomed their first child, a boy, last year. In a recent interview with The Sunday Times about his treatment, Kit recalled going 'through some pretty horrible stuff' after the conclusion of the hit show. 'Things that have happened to me since Thrones ended, and that were happening during Thrones, were of a pretty traumatic nature and they did include alcohol,' he said at the time. 'You get to a place where you feel like you are a bad person, you feel like you are a shameful person. And you feel that there's no way out, that's just who you are. And getting sober is the process of going, 'No, I can change.'' Now three years on, Rose told Harper's Bazaar UK that she was 'doing well' but it wasn't on her to police her husband. 'I've learnt a lot about addiction and it's something Kit is forever going to be aware of, but it's on him whether he chooses to drink again,' she said. 'No amount of nannying is going to be able to stop him from doing what he decides to do... I don't choose to put that pressure on myself. The responsibility of his behaviour is on him. It's not on me to guard him from it.' Read the full interview here.

The TV presenter took part in last year's series of Strictly and was a frontrunner throughout the competition, although an injury prevented her from competing in the live finale, which was won by Rose Ayling-Ellis. On Friday morning, it was confirmed that AJ would serve as the UK's spokesperson during the scoring part of the Eurovision final next month. In a first for Eurovision, it's also been revealed she will announce the UK's allocated points live from the North West. And it's safe to say fans are excited at the prospect of having more of AJ on our screens...  AJ follows in the footsteps of last year's spokesperson Amanda Holden, who received something of a mixed reception when she joked about not knowing the difference between Dutch and French during her section. Past stars to have announced the UK's points include celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, former Bake Off host Mel Giedroyc and daytime host Lorraine Kelly. Sam Ryder will be competing at Eurovision on behalf of the UK with his song Spaceman, hoping to turn things around for us after last year's infamous nul points result.

The Bad Guy singer put out a 'ask me a question' call on Instagram to her 102 million followers on Wednesday when one fan asked who her childhood celebrity crush was. Billie responded with a photo on her Instagram Story of Sarah Michelle Gellar in her role as Buffy Summers in the 90s supernatural teen drama, Buffy The Vampire Slayer. It wasn't long before the US actor got word of Billie's crush and got back to the singer with an absolutely killer response. 'I'm dead. That's all,' Sarah shared in a post on her Instagram.

Anne-Marie Trevelyan made the revelation after two female Tory MPs said they saw a male colleague watching porn on his phone in the commons. The international trade secretary said there were 'a few' male MPs who think that being elected 'makes them God's gift to women and suddenly they think they can please themselves'. Trevelyan told LBC's Nick Ferrari some of the sexism she had faced included: 'A number of years ago being pinned up against a wall by a male MP who is now no longer in the house, I'm pleased to say, declaring that I must want him because he was a powerful man. 'These sorts of things, the power abuses that a very small minority, thank goodness, of male colleagues show is completely unacceptable.' Trevelyan said all women in parliament had been subjected to 'inappropriate language' and 'wandering hands'. The Tory MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed also told Sky News: 'I think all of us as women in parliament have been subjected to inappropriate language, to wandering hands - as my granny used to call it. It doesn't change. 'The vast majority of the men I work with are delightful, they are committed parliamentarians, they're passionate about the causes they fight, but there are a few for whom too much drink or indeed a sort of a view that somehow being elected makes them God's gift to women that they can suddenly please themselves.' She said that sort of behaviour was 'never OK' and added: 'Disrespect for women and indeed some of the younger women who are not parliamentarians who are part of our parliamentary family. That is never OK. 'It's never OK anywhere. It's not OK in Westminster either and we have had a number of ways to help women now share their anxiety, the experiences that they've had following on from the Me Too campaign a few years ago. 'We have now started to make frameworks that ensure that women can speak up but it's still, I think, not as good as it could be. 'Fundamentally, if you're a bloke, keep your hands in your pockets and behave as you would if you had your daughter in the room.' The Tory party's chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris has called for the case to be referred to parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) which investigates allegations of harassment and sexual misconduct. The disciplinary process could lead to a recommendation that the MP is suspended or forced out of the commons if a complaint is upheld. Prime minister Boris Johnson said the allegations were 'obviously unacceptable' while attorney general Suella Braverman said a minority of men in parliament behaved like 'animals'. It comes after separate claims that 56 MPs are currently facing sexual misconduct investigations, including three cabinet ministers and two shadow cabinet ministers.",

After lead actor nominee Will Smith shook viewers around the world with his onstage assault of comedian Chris Rock, Andrew was seen trying to subtly use his phone under a table in a moment that quickly turned into a meme. 'I feel so bad because Kevin Costner's introducing the director nominees in the most beautiful and elegant way, and I'm like, 'There's no way I'm gonna be on camera during this,'' the Spider-Man star told The View during an appearance on the talk show on Thursday. 'And everyone's texting me, you know, asking me, you know, what they were asking me, like what the vibe in the room is. At that moment, my friends took priority over Kevin. But I feel really bad about that.' The actor wouldn't acknowledge the slap directly, but the director category took place after the incident, and The View co-host Joy Behar said she could 'read between the lines.' Andrew could only laugh in response. He flat-out refused to give his opinion on the slap, saying, 'Every possible version of the discussion has happened.' Andrew who earned his second Oscar nomination this year for his performance in Tick, Tick ...

The British star revealed he his quitting the US talk show during Thursday night's episode, saying the programme had 'changed my life' and promised there would be 'lots of tears' when his tenure came to an end. The presenter and actor has extended his contract with CBS to present the show for one more year before finishing in the summer of 2023.

    "93165a34a9010ee4d5af43326615ab81046f608f4f62c7f12e4ef442": "Making mistakes happens to all of us in our careers. But some of us hold on to these mistakes longer than others.  Maybe you lie awake at night still feeling queasy and anxious over the way you frustrated a client by accidentally giving them the wrong information. Maybe you are avoiding co-workers on your team because you feel like they are all judging you for that error, even though it happened last week. If either of these scenarios sounds familiar, you may be prone to obsessing over mistakes. What fuels these constant worries is the shame of feeling completely inadequate and fear of others discovering your lack of capabilities, says Tanisha Ranger, a Nevada-based clinical psychologist. Once you start obsessing over mistakes because of your shame, it can steamroll into bigger problems like perfectionism. 'Shame often gives way to perfectionism, and perfectionism makes mistakes feel monumental. Essentially, 'If I don't do everything perfectly right then I am a failure and everyone will see my defectiveness,'' she says. 'I've had many clients who struggled with obsessing over mistakes at work. [They lay] awake at night ruminating and beating themselves up over a mistake, not an intentional or careless mess-up, but a mistake.' There's a better way to acknowledge a mistake while still letting it go. Here's how: 1. Put the mistake in perspective After you make an obvious mistake at work, you may want the ground to swallow you up to save you from the embarrassment, shame and anxiety of facing your co-workers again. If these worries are keeping you up at night, challenge those thoughts by getting more realistic with your thinking, suggests Shannon Garcia, a psychotherapist at States of Wellness Counselling. 'Will the world end? Nope,' she says. 'Will you get fired? Highly unlikely. Will you receive constructive feedback from your boss? Maybe. Will owning up to your mistake be uncomfortable? Probably. Have you survived past mistakes? Seems like it, if you're reading this. Will you survive this one? Yes!' Sometimes accidental oversights do hurt your job performance, but it's important to not catastrophise what happened. 'Sure, it caused a delay. Yes, it may have cost the company some money. OK, it negatively impacted job performance. But is it actually the end of your career? Really? Likely not,' says Ranger. 'Shrinking things down to their right size, not ignoring/suppressing and also not overblowing or exaggerating, is an important part of letting things go.' If it helps, try putting yourself in the shoes of co-workers who have also made mistakes. Once you see the compassion and sympathy you hold for their slip-ups, you may be more inclined to be compassionate about your own. 'When a co-worker has made a mistake in the past, is it something you've judged them immensely for? Did you spend your day thinking endlessly about their mistake? No. People at work are likely reacting the same way,' Garcia says. 'No one is thinking about this more than you are.' 2. Learn that you don't have to beat yourself up as penance To move past a mistake, you also need to rethink what it means to learn from a mistake. If you think turning over every angle of how an interaction with your boss could have gone better, for example, take a deep breath. Give yourself permission to release those thoughts, says organisational psychologist Laura Gallaher of the consulting firm Gallaher Edge. People ruminate because they believe there are payoffs to worrying so much; they think 'A conscientious person would worry about this,' Gallaher says. 'When you know that you can simultaneously be a conscientious person, and also forgive yourself to move forward, it will be easier to do so.' What Garcia tells her clients the most is 'be nice to yourself,' she says. Reframe your worries in a more positive light. 'The fact that you are anxious about it means you care. That's what your boss, co-workers and customers care about the most,' Garcia says. 'Try not to beat yourself up over it. Create an affirmation to repeat to yourself whenever those negative self-talk thoughts pop up: 'I accept my mistake, I choose to learn from it, and I am moving forward.'' If you are stuck in the world of 'could've/should've' in regards to your error, be honest with yourself about what you did not know. Ranger says she works with some clients by asking them to consider why they supposedly 'should have known better.' 'It's always so enticing to impose our current knowledge and wisdom on a past version of ourselves that could not have known to make that decision with the information we had at that time,' she says.  3. Don't hide the mistake. Own what happened, but don't take on other people's judgement, too When you make a big blunder at work, you may instinctually want to shut down, repress it, and forget it ever happened.  If you feel the urge to withdraw, challenge yourself to do the opposite. Be the one to bring it up in conversation with co-workers or your boss. 'If it was something that inconvenienced them, apologise for it,' Garcia says. 'Then it's a conversation happening where you are involved, people are likely to be gracious, and everyone can move on from there.'  It may sound counterintuitive, but being transparent about your mistake and its impact can be healing. 'It can feel like a cold shower - before you do it, you fear it and feel uneasy or anxious,' Gallaher explains. 'In the moment of being open, it can feel unpleasant at first, but once it's over, you actually feel more refreshed 99% of the time. Taking accountability without blaming anybody is the most healing.' Once you model being open and accountable, it may encourage others to do so as well. 'Most of the time, when you lead with self-accountability, that vulnerability is courageous, and courage is contagious: People usually respond with their own self-accountability as well,' Gallaher says.  Of course, sometimes being honest about a mistake can also inspire eye-rolling judgement and harsh criticism from mean-spirited colleagues. You should hold yourself accountable for your mistake, but the judgement of your peers is not something you need to take on, too. 'Let them know what you intend to do differently to try to prevent something like this from happening in the future, and then accept that they may move on or they may not. It is outside of your control,' Ranger advises. 'Taking on other people's emotions is detrimental to yourself and makes it difficult for you to treat yourself with the kindness and compassion you deserve from you.'",
    "b55fa75338995a146f921448e847529847c1a88da62e0687d1eed5d1": "If you're watching EastEnders, you'll see that Stuart Highway has been struggling with breast cancer.  Creators of the long-standing TV show wanted to shine a spotlight on male breast cancer and actor Ricky Champ, who plays Stuart, has been consulting with real-life victims to gain insight into the role.  Before the storyline kicked off, Champ met with Doug Harper, 61, from London, who was diagnosed with the condition in 2011. Just before Christmas, Harper felt a lump on his left nipple which he presumed was a cyst and continued to ignore 'as blokes do', he says. After showing the nipple to a GP, they sent him to hospital and ran tests on Harper, sadly confirming that it was cancer. 'As soon as I showed the nipple to the GP, their demeanour changed immediately and they booked an urgent appointment at the hospital for it to be checked out,' Harper tells HuffPost UK. 'Being told I had breast cancer was a scary and confusing time, not only for me, but also for my friends and family. But everyone was so supportive, some even made light hearted comments about the news to lift the gloom, something they knew I would appreciate.' Just like Stuart on the soap, one of the reasons Harper felt confused was because he didn't think it could be breast cancer as it's not spoken about as much in men as women. When the oncologist told him he had cancer he says he doesn't remember anything else apart from asking if he was going to die - he was told hopefully that wouldn't be the case. Since having chemotherapy treatment, Harper has become passionate about raising awareness of the condition and informing people that it can happen to anyone, regardless of gender. He is also part of a male cancer support group that he attends monthly. So when EastEnders came to him to ask about his experience, Harper was glad for the opportunity.  He tells HuffPost: 'Ricky was brilliant. While he's been playing the part, he's identified the problems that men with breast cancer can get, he just really embraced it. He came along to our group support meeting, and it was uplifting because we need more publicity for men with breast cancer.  'The storyline was really subtle, Stuart's experience of first getting diagnosed was very similar to ours, being in denial, not thinking it was happening and the shock that comes with it.' Harper mentions that the soap accurately showed how alienating the condition can be as Stuart is handed two leaflets of support for breast cancer patients - but in both, women are pictured.  Harper, who has since had chemotherapy, is in a band called Steve White & the Protest Family and has written a song about encouraging people to 'check their moobs'. He hopes more men will check themselves, saying: 'Just know that men can get it. So, check your nipples, check under your arms. And if anything looks different, it could be a cyst or what looks like a cyst on your nipple, it could be a rash, an inverted nipple, or something else under your arms, if you see it, go straight to your doctor.' He has also been working with Macmillan Cancer support. The charity's strategic advisor for treatment, Dany Bell, who has more than 30 years' experience working as a cancer nurse, added: 'Nearly 400 men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the UK. But we know it's still not something that is widely recognised or known by many people. 'Storylines like Stuart's in TV shows like EastEnders play such a vital role in helping to raise awareness and to make more people aware of the signs of breast cancer in both men and women. Early diagnosis can improve - and even save lives - and we hope this important plot will get more men regularly check their own chests and reaching out for help, if needed.' If you're living with cancer and need to speak to people, about the big things and small things, you can contact Macmillan Cancer Support.",

A research team from Stanford University said the mixture of two medications had worked well in an initial test cohort of nine women to disrupt ovulation at the time of their cycle when the chances of ovulation were highest. This has led to hopes that a 'day before' contraceptive pill could one day be made available - rather than couples relying on the daily pill, barrier protection, or in cases of unprotected sex, the 'morning after' or emergency pill. 'Emergency contraception pills work by inhibiting ovulation,' said Dr Erica Cahill, author of the Stanford research. 'These medications do not affect anything about intercourse or sperm. If they are taken near or after ovulation, they are ineffective. The best way to be effective is to take them before ovulation occurs. 'Ideally, an on-demand or pericoital pill would allow people to take a pill to prevent ovulation ahead of intercourse.' How does the 'morning after' pill work? The 'morning after' pill is a progesterone-only hormone pill that works by delaying the release of an egg from an ovary.  In the UK, there are two types of emergency pill - levonorgestrel, known as Levonelle and ulipristal acetate, known as ellaOne. As the NHS explains, you need to take the emergency pill within three days (Levonelle) or five days (ellaOne) of unprotected sex to be effective. There's usually just one pill to take and the sooner you do, the greater your chances of avoiding pregnancy. The morning after pill does not end a pregnancy that has already implanted. How might the 'day before' pill work? The days just before ovulation are known as the luteal surge, the hormonal increase that triggers ovulation. It usually starts about 36 hours beforehand. This is the most challenging time to stop the ovulation process as it's when an egg is most likely to be fertilised.  Women in the Stanford study were given a mixture of ulipristal acetate, which is currently used in the ellaOne morning-after pill, and meloxicam, a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Ulipristal acetate can stop ovulation but only when it's taken before the beginning of the luteal surge. Research suggests meloxicam may be able to disrupt ovulation after the luteal surge has started.  This is why the research team combined both drugs to see if they'd be able to work at a women's peak fertility.  Nine women took the combined drugs around the time of their luteal surge and then underwent ultrasound scans and had their hormone levels monitored. In six of the women, ovulation was disrupted. Eight met some criteria for incomplete ovulation. On average, their cycles were three days longer than expected.  How promising is this development? As Dr Becky Mawson at The Lowdown, a contraceptive advice platform, explains to HuffPost UK: 'Contraception works on preventing egg and sperm meeting. The idea behind the day-before contraception is delaying the egg release till after the sperm has died off and therefore can't fertilise. 'Sadly, a 'day-before' contraceptive is still very far from being used even in research setting,' she cautions, stressing the small size of the test cohort. 'We can't comment on effectiveness as it isn't being used to prevent pregnancy at moment and only in nine women. Trials will be needed of thousands of women using it to prevent pregnancy and look at failures rates.' However, Mawson believes 'any new research in the area is great. The more options available to people the more chance people will use them to prevent unwanted pregnancy if women don't want to be using a daily pill anymore.'",
    "1d95915e44177b6080ac87864a866bbd45654cc3ca0b2dc2bcc43925": "The Spectator magazine has faced a backlash after publishing an article where a journalist argued in favour of a man's right to 'stare at women'. Labour MP Dawn Butler called the Cosmo Landesman's piece 'creepy' and 'misogynistic' as he responded to Transport for London's poster campaign warning people against 'intrusive staring'. The campaign aims to keep women safe against 'common examples of sexual harassment', including cat calling, exposing, upskirting and touching. And posters have been put up warning: 'Intrusive staring of a sexual nature is sexual harassment and is not tolerated.' In his rebuttal, Landesman went on a Tube ride 'to stare at women', used a variety of stares from 'sexy beast' to 'pervy bloke', and argued it was 'impossible to resist the gravitational pull' of an attractive face. Landesman wrote: 'For the purposes of research I went on a Tube ride to stare at women - and yes, I know how weird that sounds. At any sign of discomfort I would immediately have stopped. But believe me, staring - sexual or otherwise - is not an easy thing to do. Most men are too wimpy to make eye contact. We are socialised not to let our eyes linger, first by our parents - 'It's rude to stare!' - and then by the #MeToo activists - 'It's sexism to stare!' 'I tried a mix of stares - my best sexy stare, my pervy bloke stare, and my just-escaped-from-the-mental-hospital stare - each for at least 30 seconds. I got one titter, one smile and one roll of the eyes. Most women did not notice I was staring. Why? Because on Tubes most women - and men - are so busy staring at their phones that they don't pay attention to what anybody else is doing.'  The article comes days after The Mail on Sunday's much-criticised report on Angela Rayner, which caused an outcry over claims the Labour deputy leader crossed and uncrossed her legs during prime minister's questions to distract Boris Johnson. The reaction was as one might expect.  But when the police force that monitors the rail network feels it has to intervene, perhaps you haven't got the tone quite right.  The British Transport Police tweeted: 'Women who've been on the receiving end of this behaviour know when it's intrusive, and we'll always take them seriously. If you're ever made to feel uncomfortable, please do text us on 61016. Oh, and please don't travel on the tube to try out your 'pervy bloke stare', thanks.'",
    "b572b0d6af55b8605e698fb2a8c6732fc41027f72f2c289d1b4bfde9": "Westminster was nicknamed Pestminster just five years ago due to a series of sexual misconduct accusations - and judging from the recent news, the culture in parliament has hardly improved. As POLITICO's Playbook pointed out, 'it seems every few months we go through the same charade' of shock, 'empty promises of zero tolerance' and reforms - only for the cycle to soon repeat itself. An MP suggested to the outlet that the 'culture of rule-breaking' in parliament has worsened because 'nothing happens' when MPs act out. Of course, allegations of sexism stretch back much further. The first female MP, Nancy Astor, was not even elected until 1919, which was just one year after women were even allowed to vote. But here are all the most worrying claims which have hit the headlines in just the last five years. 1. Angela Rayner's techniques of 'distraction' Over the weekend, The Mail on Sunday published a story based on claims from anonymous Tory MPs that Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, was deliberately trying to distract the prime minister during PMQs. According to the report, Rayner did this by crossing and uncrossing her legs, channelling Sharon Stone's well-known scene in Basic Instinct. Rayner said she was 'crestfallen' about the sexist comments, and received support from her colleagues across the house, including Boris Johnson. However, journalists from the newspaper refused to discuss the matter with the speaker of the house Sir Lindsay Hoyle, citing freedom of the press as their defence. 2. Tory MP accused of watching porn in the Commons On Tuesday night, a female minister alleged she had seen a male Tory MP watching porn on his phone while sat next to her in the house of commons, according to reports from The Mirror and The Sun. She told Tory chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris at a meeting of the Conservative MPs. Her claim then triggered a flurry of further stories about how male MPs behave in Westminster from 14 colleagues. The Conservative Party reportedly has the name of the culprit but will not be revealing it, although it is believed not to be a frontbencher.  Downing Street has already admitted that more needs to be done to improve the culture in parliament in light of these allegations and an investigation has been launched into the this 'wholly unacceptable' behaviour. Tory peer Nicky Morgan has even suggested expelling the culprit from the party as a 'minimum'. 3. Labour MP told she is a 'secret weapon' An anonymous Welsh MP told BBC Wales that a member of the shadow cabinet allegedly described her as a 'secret weapon' and a 'vote winner'. The shadow cabinet member reportedly told their colleague this was because 'women want to be her friend' while men want to sleep with her. A Labour spokesperson said that if a complaint was put forward, it would be taken 'extremely seriously', but the MP decided it was in her best interests not to reveal her identity or make an official complaint. 4. Fifty-six MPs under investigation for sexual misconduct Approximately 70 complaints about 56 MPs were reportedly sent to parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) according to reports from The Sunday Times. These allegations - yet to corroborated - are said to include sexual harassment claims and 'more serious wrongdoing'. 4. Tory MP suspended over sexual offences allegations Tory MP Charlie Elphicke was suspended from the Conservatives in November 2017, following accusations of sexual offences against two staff members. He then had the whip restored to him in December 2018, during Theresa May's time in office. He was then able to take part in the confidence vote in the Conservative Party's leadership. Then in 2019 he was charged with three counts of sexual assault linked to two women. He denied the charges while the party whip was withdrawn on the same day. His now estranged wife succeeded him in the next general election. In September 2020, he was sentenced two years in prison - he was released a year later. 5. Tory MP suspended over explicit texts to female constituents Andrew Griffiths resigned from his ministerial role and was suspended from the Tory Party in July 2018. It followed reports from the Sunday Mirror that he had sent 2,000 sex texts across three weeks to two female constituents. In November 2018, he told The Sunday Times that the texts were 'the result of my mental breakdown'. He later had the whip restored and was then able to take part in the same confidence vote as Elphicke over May's leadership.  He was cleared of breaching the Commons' code of conduct in September 2019 over the texts as he had not been carrying out parliamentary duties at the time. Griffiths was succeeded by his estranged wife, Kate, in the 2019 general election. In 2021, Griffiths was found to have raped and physically abused his wife during their marriage in a civil court judgment that journalists had to fight to get published. He has said that he 'strongly denied the allegations put to me'. 6. Defence secretary admits behaviour 'fell short' Michael Fallon resigned as defence secretary in November 2017 telling the BBC: 'The culture has changed over the years. What might have been acceptable 10, 15 years ago is clearly not acceptable now.' It came after journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer claimed the politician repeatedly touched her knee during a 2002 dinner. 7. Minister resigns over inquiry into misconduct allegations Damian Green resigned as the cabinet office minister in 2017 after an inquiry into claims he sexually harassed a women and looked at porn on a work computer. The probe found he breached the ministerial code, although he maintained that he did not 'download or view' the porn. 8. Labour MP suspended over inappropriate contact Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins was accused of sexual harassment towards a Labour Party activist in November 2017, according to The Daily Telegraph, and was subsequently suspended from the party. He rejected the accusations. Fellow MP Kerry McCarthy then said he had been paying her unwanted attention for years in written notes, then republished in The Guardian. He resigned from Labour in January 2021. 9. Labour MP accused of sexual harassment MP Ivan Lewis was accused of sexually harassing a 19-year-old at a Labour event, a claim he denied. The Labour Party said it 'takes all allegations of sexual harassment extremely seriously' and suspended him pending an investigation. He then quit the party in December 2018.",
    "9c4d5c8a0681b6763b6f42acad34d1def054d1ce28694cdb93620079": "Implementing red tape to deliver the government's own Brexit deal 'would have been an act of self harm', Jacob Rees-Mogg has said. The Brexit opportunities minister's admission come as the Tories dropped plans to impose further checks on goods entering the UK from the European Union. The change means restrictions on the imports of chilled meats from the EU and border checks on plant and animal products will not be introduced in July. Rees-Mogg said not pressing ahead with the new restrictions is 'saving British businesses up to PS1 billion in annual costs'.  When pressed about restrictions that would have actually 'cost' PS1 billion, and the idea pushed by ministers that post-Brexit checks were not going to be disruptive, he told an interviewer: 'That's why we are not adopting them. This would have been an act of self harm if we had gone ahead with it.' The comments raise questions about whether Brexit will deliver the promised economic benefits of independence from the bloc, and whether the government was edging towards a position where it would unilaterally accept EU controls.  Goods moving from the UK have been subject to checks in the EU since the Brexit withdrawal agreement was implemented on January 1, 2021.  Rees-Mogg said a 'new regime of border import controls' will be established by the end of 2023. The new border regime will apply equally to goods from the EU and from the rest of the world. The government has vowed to have 'the world's best border' following the decision to leave the EU's single market and customs union. Port operators expressed frustration that time and money spent preparing for the new checks has been 'wasted'. Tim Morris, chief executive of the UK Major Ports Group, which represents UK port operators, said: 'Many ports have been working incredibly hard and have invested over PS100 million of their own money to build a network of brand new border checks to meet the requirements the government has been insisting on for several years. 'This now looks like wasted time, effort and money to develop what we fear will be highly bespoke white elephants.' On whether the UK would adopt EU controls, the prime minister's official spokesman said: 'That is not the approach we are taking. We are using the flexibility that the UK government has to decide how and when to introduce this approach. 'We think there is more work to do on a new model that better utilises data and technology. We are still committed to introducing these checks.'",

Two female Tory MPs have said they saw a male colleague watching porn on his phone in the commons. The prime minister said no-one should be behave like that in any workplace 'up and down the country'. Asked whether the MP will lose the Conservative whip if the allegations are proven, Johnson said: 'I think it's obviously unacceptable for anybody to be doing that kind of thing in the workplace. 'It would be the same for any kind of job up and down the country, let's be absolutely clear about that.' He made the comments on a visit to Burnley on Thursday and added: 'What needs to happen now is that the proper procedures need to be gone through, the independent complaints and grievances procedure needs to be activated and we need to get to understand the facts, but, yeah, that kind of behaviour is clearly totally unacceptable.'   The Tory party's chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris has called for the case to be referred to parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) which investigates allegations of harassment and sexual misconduct. The disciplinary process could lead to a recommendation that the MP is suspended or forced out of the commons if a complaint is upheld. It comes after separate claims that 56 MPs are currently facing sexual misconduct investigations, including three cabinet ministers and two shadow cabinet ministers. Attorney General Suella Braverman said a minority of men in Parliament behaved like 'animals'. She told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that if a Tory MP was found to have been watching pornography in the commons chamber they should have the whip suspended and face the prospect of being ousted from parliament. 'I think that we would really need to see a situation where the whip should be removed - I'm ashamed this person is carrying a Conservative rosette,' she said, adding they could be subject to a recall process and 'no longer holding their privileged position as a Member of Parliament'.

The Oscar-winning star appears as Nick's mum in the drama, which follows the lives of Charlie Spring and Nick Nelson after they meet at school and fall in love. Since the series' debut on the streaming service earlier this month, fans have celebrated the touching moment in which Nick comes out to his mother as bisexual.  However, Olivia was so moved by the scene as the pair prepared to film it that she cried, Kit told ITV's This Morning.  Speaking to hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, he said: 'We normally before every scene read it through about 50%, you don't go 100% of the way. We were reading it through and suddenly Olivia just started crying.  'At first, I was thinking, 'God, she's just really good, I need to step it up my game massively here,' so I was really worried at that point. I think then other people told me afterwards that it was because it's such a beautifully written scene and a crucial part in so many people's lives. I think it really touched her.  'I was just scared to be honest,' he joked, describing her as 'the most absolutely lovely person in the world'.  Heartstopper's screenwriter Alice Oseman previously admitted she was 'shocked' that the show had managed to get Olivia on board for her cameo appearance.  She told PA: 'When we were discussing trying to get a big name to be Nick's mum, I was literally like, there's no way this is going to happen. 'This is the silliest idea ever and there's literally not any point doing this. 'But we tried anyway and Olivia wanted to do it, and I just couldn't believe it. 'There's really no other way to say it, I was just shocked but so, so happy, because she's such an incredible actress, she brings so much to that character, and all the scenes with Nick's mum just feel so special and subtle and just really beautiful performance.'

The estate agent split from the This Is Us star during filming of the third season of the hit Netflix reality series back in November 2019, which she said at the time had come as a complete shock to her. Because of the drama, she came close to packing in her starring role on Selling Sunset, as she recently told the Dear Media podcast Lipstick On The Rim.  'The divorce was the most public and humiliating thing you could ever go through,' she said. 'I still had to film a reality show, it was carry on with that or quit and I wanted this new career so I stayed in the end.  'I pushed through and I just had to be open and I think that is better than pretending everything is ok.' Chrishell said that she found therapy 'an amazing tool' in helping her deal with the aftermath of the split, adding: 'I didn't have much control over how it went down so I had to look after myself.' Following her divorce, Chrishell went on to embark on a relationship with Selling Sunset co-star and The Oppenheim Group boss Jason Oppenheim, with their romance taking centre stage in the current series.

    "876274169e3fddd3cd871f28e353f909f947c04e89f9d5638d262e68": "The term 'prorogation' summons flashbacks of the Brexit crisis, when Boris Johnson unlawfully suspended parliament and had to apologise to the Queen.  Despite that controversy, prorogation is a routine process that signals the end of a parliamentary session and brings nearly all of its business to a close. Parliament is proroguing Thursday afternoon and MPs will return to their constituencies until the Queen's Speech on May 10. Here, HuffPost UK talks you through what it means, what MPs do during that period and remind you of what happened during Brexit.  What is the prorogation of parliament? Prorogation is the means by which a parliamentary 'session' is brought to an end. A session is a parliamentary year which normally starts in the Spring, with the state opening of parliament, and runs for around 12 months, ending with the prorogation of the session. There are normally five sessions in each parliament. How does it work? Prorogation is what is known as a 'prerogative power' exercised by the Crown on the advice of the Privy Council - an advisory body to the monarch. Essentially, the government of the day advises the Crown to prorogue and that request is acquiesced to. Why is prorogation needed? Prorogation is required to prepare for a Queen's Speech which is held on the day parliament reopens during a ceremony known as the state opening of parliament. The speech allows the government to outline its priorities for the upcoming year. A new parliamentary session can provide procedural opportunities to revisit matters where legislation was unable to progress in a previous session. What impact does it have? Prorogation brings to an end the proceedings in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Unless a specific provision is made - such as the standing orders to 'carry-over' bills - no business of a previous Parliamentary session may be carried over into the next session. Motions set down and orders made for business to be considered on future days all fall at prorogation, as do unanswered parliamentary questions. Select committee inquiries continue, though no committee may meet during prorogation. Statutory periods for consideration of secondary legislation are suspended over prorogation, but the legislation itself does not fall. What do MPs do during prorogation? While Parliament is prorogued, MPs and peers cannot formally debate government policy and legislation, submit questions, scrutinise through parliamentary committees or introduce legislation of their own. It means hundreds of MPs will return to their constituencies to focus on local issues. With the local elections just a week away, many MPs will be joining campaign teams on the doorstep. How long is parliament prorogued? Since the 1980s prorogation has rarely lasted more than two weeks. It has always led either to the dissolution of the current parliament - prior to a general election - or the start of a new parliamentary session. This year, the state opening of parliament will take place on Tuesday May 10 when MPs will return to the commons. What happens at the state opening? The state opening of parliament marks the formal start of the parliamentary year and the Queen's speech sets out the government's agenda for the coming session, outlining proposed policies and legislation. The speech is written by the government and is read out by the Queen from the throne in the House of Lords chamber. It is main ceremonial event in the parliamentary calendar and for over 500 years, has served as a symbolic reminder of the unity of parliament's three parts: the sovereign, the House of Lords and the House of Commons. The event is steeped in pomp and ceremony with a procession from Buckingham Palace to parliament.   The Queen will travel in the Irish state coach, an ornate four-horse-drawn carriage. A coach carrying the royal regalia - the Imperial State Crown, the Cap of Maintenance and Sword of State - precedes the monarch. The Queen will enter through the Sovereign's Entrance under the Victoria Tower, at the opposite end of the palace to Big Ben, and the royal standard replaces the union flag over Westminster until the Queen leaves the palace at the end of the ceremony. When inside, the sovereign dons the Imperial State Crown and ceremonial robes before making their way to the House of Lords. More recently the Queen has not worn the gown or the crown on account of how heavy they are.   What happened during Brexit? At the height of the Brexit crisis in August 2019, just before MPs returned from their summer recess, Boris Johnson asked the Queen to shut Parliament for five weeks, between September 9 until October 14.   Critics said it was an attempt to suppress MPs' opportunities to block a no-deal Brexit because they would have been stopped from sitting for 24 working days.     The government claimed it had nothing to do with Brexit and argued prorogation was a 'proceeding in Parliament' to allow the prime minister to outline plans for domestic policies, such as NHS funding.   However, on September 24, the Supreme Court ruled the prorogation unlawful. The court's president, Lady Hale, said the suspension 'had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification'. Following the ruling, parliament reopened the next day. Johnson also personally apologised for embarrassing the Queen, according to reports. ",
    "9c01075663be3c297c4a1b2cc7edd5e23cc3751c5331c2cb12fa5d19": "Veteran radio presenter and DJ Tim Westwood has been accused by several women of sexual misconduct in new reports this week. He 'strongly rejects all allegations of wrongdoing' and stepped down from his Capital Xtra 'until further notice' on Wednesday. Here's everything you need to know. Where did the allegations come from? According to a joint investigation from the BBC and the Guardian, Westwood has been accused of misusing his powerful position. All of the allegations published in the investigation this week have come from Black women in the music industry. Three women accused Westwood of opportunistic and predatory sexual behaviour while an additional four alleged he groped them at events when they were in their late teens or early 20s. All of the incidents reportedly took place between 1992 and 2017. Two of the women claim he initiated unwanted and unexpected sex, while another said she was subjected to unwanted oral sex and four others accused him of touching their bodies inappropriately as they posed for photos with him. The accusers do not know each other. According to the BBC, 'some work in the music industry and fear repercussions'. One woman told the broadcaster: 'I would describe it as an abuse of power because...who they're going to believe? This little girl from the Midlands, or this big shiny star from London? He's on national radio, international.' The seven women, who all claim to have met Westwood through his work, have chosen to remain anonymous. Their allegations were unpacked in a BBC Three documentary, Tim Westwood: Abuse of Power, which aired on Tuesday at 9pm. None of the women who spoke to the BBC have reported the incidents to the police. They said they were coming forward to make sure Westwood is 'held accountable' for his behaviour and to encourage others to come forward. Who is Westwood? Westwood, 64, began his career in hip hop on local radio, before moving to Capital Radio in London. He then secured his own show on BBC Radio 1 in 1994 where he hosted the first nationally-broadcast rap programme. He has since become an influential figure in the hip-hop world. He left the BBC in 2013, and returned to Capital where, up until Wednesday, he was presenting regular Capital Xtra shows on Saturday nights. How has Westwood responded? A representative for the DJ told PA news agency: 'Tim Westwood strongly denies all allegations of inappropriate behaviour. 'In a career that has spanned 40 years, there have never been any complaints made against him officially or unofficially. 'Tim Westwood strongly rejects all allegations of wrongdoing.' Three of his planned DJ sets have since been cancelled and the events page of his website, which had more UK events planned for the next month, has been taken down. What's the history behind these claims? Aside from Westwood's status in the music industry, this case has caused a particular stir because this is not the first time concerns about the DJ have been raised. HuffPost UK had an exclusive in July 2020 about the pressure Global Media - the parent company of Capital - was facing to launch an investigation into Westwood's conduct at the time. Global was heavily criticised (including by its own staff) for not addressing the claims publicly and for keeping Westwood's show running when allegations of sexual misconduct against Westwood first emerged. Back in 2020, a source told HuffPost UK: 'Many presenters across the brands are uncomfortable with the situation and the executives have personally told staff not to speak to the media, which is unprecedented.' The exclusive followed an online hashtag which emerged that June called #SurvivingTimWestwood, as word of the claims against the DJ spread. The allegations also led to a change.org petition calling for the mayor of London and the Met Police to launch an investigation into Westwood's alleged behaviour towards Black female students. It accumulated more than 6,000 signatures. However, the Met was not able to explain whether it had launched a probe into the DJ. Westwood strongly denied the allegations at the time. He told HuffPost UK: 'I can categorically say that I have never had an inappropriate relationship with anyone under the age of 18. I am aware of attempts by anonymous sources to make fabricated allegations online. I can confirm that such allegations are false and without any foundation.' A representation for Westwood told HuffPost UK that no complaints against him had been received at Capital Xtra, although an anonymous producer from Global alleged in 2020 that staff were 'outraged' at the company's 'silence'. Several Black British public figures contributed to the conversation around Westwood then as well, such as presenter Grace Victory and DJ Funk Butcher. Westwood's peer in the hip hop industry, the late rapper Ty Chijioke, also previously referred to the veteran DJ as a vulture in reference to his behaviour with young fans.  Speaking to the BBC during the 2022 investigation, one of the women accusing Westwood said: 'Finally people's allegations are starting to be taken seriously.' What has the BBC and Capital said? BBC director general Tim Davie said he had not found any evidence of complaints made about Westwood when he was working there. He said: 'I've asked and we've looked at our records and we've seen no evidence. 'If something like this were raised or anything comes up, we investigate it fully. And I would hope we were doing that in that time as well.  'I would simply say if people have evidence where things weren't followed up, or they have concerns in this area, bring it to us. We want to investigate it.' He said the testimonies were 'shocking' and encouraged people to bring forward 'evidence of wrong doing', because 'there's nothing worse in life than abuse of power'. He added: 'You need to be absolutely clear that it's completely unacceptable.' A spokesperson from Capital's parent company Global confirmed on Wednesday that 'following the claims that have recently come to light, Tim Westwood has stepped down from his show until further notice.'

But he at least has confirmation that Guardians Of The Galaxy director James Gunn has his back, with the filmmaker coming to the actor's defence on Twitter Monday amid calls to axe him from future Marvel films. Responding to a viral tweet calling for Marvel to replace the actor with Patrick Wilson, Gunn said he would 'never' oust Pratt, who is set to reunite with the director in a third Guardians film next year.  'For what? Because of your made-up, utterly-false beliefs about him? For something that someone else told you about him that's not true?' Gunn wrote. 'Chris Pratt would never be replaced as Star-Lord but, if he ever was, we would all be going with him.'  Pratt has fielded plenty of backlash in recent years over his rumored political affiliation -- he sparked controversy ahead of the 2020 presidential election for mocking the importance of voting. However, the actor has largely stayed out of the political fray, having previously said that he doesn't feel represented by Democrats or Republicans.   He's also come under fire for his past connections to churches that have a history of discriminating against the LGBTQ community.   Back in 2019, Elliot Page publicly called Pratt out for attending an 'infamously' anti-LGBTQ church, which prompted Pratt to make a rare statement about his beliefs. 'It has recently been suggested that I belong to a church which 'hates a certain group of people' and is 'infamously anti-LGBTQ,'' Pratt posted on social media at the time. 'Nothing could be further from the truth. I go to a church that opens their doors to absolutely everyone.' Responding in a follow-up tweet on Monday, Gunn seemed to echo that same sentiment.  'I know the church he currently goes to,' the director wrote. 'Do you? (The answer is you don't, but you heard from someone who heard from someone who heard from someone where he goes to church, so decided, 'yeah, okay, I'll believe this terrible thing I heard online about this celebrity!').'  The people in Pratt's orbit have made a habit out of defending him in recent years. The actor's wife, Katherine Schwarzenegger, previously called out the 'meanness and bullying' of an Instagram post that ranked Pratt as the least popular Hollywood Chris -- a common internet competition that pits Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pine and Chris Evans and Pratt against each other. A handful of Marvel stars, including Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana and Jeremy Renner also voiced their support for Pratt in strongly worded public statements. With Gunn, Pratt has at least returned the favour after the director was booted from the Guardians franchise over past offensive tweets that were resurfaced by far-right figures in retaliation for his opposition to Donald Trump. The actor along with the rest of the Guardians cast pleaded for Gunn to be reinstated as director for the upcoming third entry in the franchise at the time in an open letter. Marvel has since given Gunn a second chance, as he's set to direct Guardians of the Galaxy 3 along with a holiday special about the ragtag group of heroes set to be released in the coming years. Pratt, meanwhile, will next appear as Star-Lord in the studio's upcoming Thor: Love and Thunder, which will hit theatres in July.",
    "74120487f2317d176fb914215e8e9c8e1eaa1337db94ce022eb35868": "A new Samsung campaign has caused a stir on Twitter - but for all the wrong reasons. Showcasing its new smart watch, the advert shows a woman waking up at 2am and then going for a run through deserted, poorly-lit streets while wearing headphones. The voiceover says: ''Sleep at night. Run faster, push harder, follow the herd' - not for me. I run on a different schedule - mine. 'Your Galaxy. Your Way.' The runner can be seen interacting with various people during her outing including a cyclist, a person at a bus stop, someone on the side of road and a group who seem to have been for a night out. All of these encounters appear to be very friendly, which has certainly surprised people on Twitter. But the ad has also been accused of being particularly tone deaf as it comes after a year of heightened conversation about women's safety. Ashling Murphy was killed in January this year while out jogging in Ireland at 4pm, prompting another wave of public outrage over the dangers women face when out in public. Reclaim These Streets, a women's safety group, described it as 'totally tone deaf' in light of Murphy's death. Her murder also sparked the hashtag #shewasonarun, where people started sharing their own experiences of being harassed while jogging. Esther Newman, from Women's Running magazine, said the advert is 'not representing the truth'. She told Radio 1 Newsbeat: 'It's really shocking. I don't know any woman who would be running at 2am in the morning. Certainly not in a city.' She added: 'Wearing headphones is a contentious point. Most women runners I know don't wear headphones and that's during the day, because they are concerned about their safety.' Newman said her contributors believe 'it's a very very small' portion of men who make women feel unsafe, but encouraged advertisers to focus on how men can make women feel more comfortable while running. The online running community Run Mummy Run also told the BBC that the portrayal of women running at night was 'unrealistic' as they do not have 'the luxury of this type of freedom with [their] safety' in reality. It's not just the running aspect of this campaign which misses the mark - women's safety in general has become one of the most pressing issues of the last year. ONS stats revealed one in two women compared to one in seven men feel unsafe when walking alone after dark in a quiet street near their home. Only in September 2021, Sabina Nessa was attacked and killed while walking through a southeast London park. The campaign also launched just 13 months after the death of Sarah Everard, who was kidnapped, raped and killed by a then-serving police officer. She was walking home through Clapham at around 9pm at the time. These high-profile cases - particularly Everard's - pushed women's safety to the top of the news agenda. The Metropolitan Police's subsequent attempts to show it is enforcing this have missed the mark significantly - only in January, officers tried to reduce spiking by randomly drug testing women. People on Twitter this week have suggested that the ad is so out of touch it must have been produced with hardly any women. Many more openly explained their own personal angst over seeing the ad.",

Addressing crowds in St Peter's Square at the Vatican on Wednesday, the head of the Catholic church urged listeners to be kinder to the matriarchs of their families. 'I'm not saying we see her as the devil, but she is always presented in a pejorative way,' he said. 'But the mother-in-law is the mother of your husband and the mother of your wife.' Perhaps I'm biased, because my own mother-in-law in a gem, but I've always found the bitter, interfering mother-in-law trope absurd. It's drenched in misogyny - much like the cliche of the evil step mother - and perpetuates the idea that women can only co-exist in a state of conflict or competition. 'Controlling', 'judgmental', 'critical' and 'overbearing' are all words that have been used to describe mother-in-laws. The phrase 'monster-in-law' is often thrown around on parenting forums. And one article goes as far as to call them 'a soul-sucking parasite that feeds on your misery.' God forbid an older woman should ever express her opinion...  Sure, some mother-in-law relationships are tricker than others, but it doesn't help women one bit if we expect women after a certain age to become silent wallflowers. Let her share her thoughts - it doesn't mean you always have to agree with them.  Of course, the culture of kindness needs to go both ways. And the Pope also had advice for mothers-in-laws. 'I tell you, be careful how you express yourselves,' he said. But one part of his speech may make you eye-roll, just a little.  'We say to ourselves 'the further away your mother-in-law is, the better'. But no - she's a mother, she's an elderly person,' he said. 'One of the most beautiful things for a woman is to have grandchildren. When her children have children, it brings her to life again.' I'd argue the most beautiful thing for a woman is to make her own choice about whether she wants children or not - and no mother-in-law should base her happiness on the possibility of grandchildren, something that is (and should always be) outside her control. But baby steps and all. He's almost got it right. This stereotype is centuries old, after all. And if we don't start to course correct the internalised trope now, it'll only come back to haunt us if we ever become mother-in-laws ourselves. ",
    "b89f92da1b3aff056e0fafcbc7b1fde93ad0d5d9e9da4c69cd048b9c": "A parliamentary watchdog has ruled that Labour MP Liam Byrne should be suspended from the House of Commons for bullying a staff member. The Independent Expert Panel (IEP) launched an investigation after a former member of Byrne's constituency staff made a complaint under parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). The commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, found that Byrne, a former Cabinet minister, had 'ostracised the complainant' between March and July 2020 following a dispute that resulted in him sending the staff member home. The IEP found that the MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill had stopped all personal contact with the staff member for several months and denied him access to his Parliamentary IT account. Stone concluded that Byrne's behaviour 'was malicious behaviour that involved a significant misuse of power' especially given the staff member's ill health and the contest of the first coronavirus lockdown.  Byrne, who did not appeal the decision, said that he was 'profoundly sorry' about the incident and that he had 'apologised in full to the individual concerned'. Giving its verdict, the IEP said: 'This case involves a serious breach of the bullying and harassment policy which arose from the respondent abusing his position of power and ostracising the complainant, who was his employee, by ceasing personal contact with him for several months and denying him access to his parliamentary IT account. 'The impact of this behaviour was compounded by the fact that it occurred during the first period of lockdown when the complainant was physically separated from work colleagues, uncertain of his future work status and had undergone a period of ill health. 'The respondent's decision not to engage with the complainant following what he perceived to be acts of misconduct was not, as he argued, a reasonable HR strategy. It was bullying. 'He should, as he now accepts, have tackled any alleged misconduct through a proper disciplinary process not by ostracising the complainant.' As well as recommending a two-day Commons suspension, the panel also said Byrne must make a written apology to the staff member and take part in management training. GMB, the union which represented Byrne's former staff member, said the sanction was 'far beneath what is needed to address the abuse'. Chair of the GMB branch for members' staff Jenny Symmons said: 'GMB welcomes the decision to uphold our member's complaint of serious bullying and harassment.  'However, the sanction of an apology, a recommendation for training and a suspension of just two days is far beneath what is needed to address this kind of abuse.  'MPs have a duty of care for their staff which we see violated time and time again.  'It's time we removed the responsibility of employment from MPs for good and give staff the safety and security at work they deserve.'  In a statement following the ruling, Byrne said he was 'extremely grateful to the parliamentary commissioner for standards and to the Independent Expert Panel for their thorough investigation and careful judgement'. He admitted that 'did not resolve the dispute correctly with a proper disciplinary process' and 'failed to fulfill my obligations as an employer and parliament's behaviour code'. 'This constituted an ostracism which was a breach of parliament's behaviour code which I strongly support, and caused distress for which I am profoundly sorry. 'I have apologised in full to the individual concerned.' He added: 'I'm incredibly grateful to the panel for recognising the genuine remorse I felt about the impact on the individual concerned, the steps I have already taken to ensure this never happens again along with the work still to do, and for concluding that I did not deliberately act to delay the investigation. 'This has been a valuable lesson for me and one I am determined to learn as me and my team seek to offer the best possible service and voice for the residents of Hodge Hill.' A Labour Party spokesperson said: 'The Labour Party fully supports the recommendations of this independent report, including the proposed sanction.'",

The 51-year-old Countryfile presenter revealed she had breast cancer in September last year and that she would be undergoing a mastectomy in order to remove a six centimetre tumour. During her appearance on the ITV show to chat about about her new documentary Julia Bradbury: Breast Cancer And Me, Julia and host Holly Willoughby were both in tears at one point as she recalled the moment she had to tell her two young children about her illness.  'Telling your children you have cancer is the hardest thing you'll ever have to do in your life,' Julia said. 'You also don't know how much you tell them to be realistic, and how much do you need to protect them.. It's a very tricky balance. I don't think any parent really knows what to do.' She added, 'One of my children said, 'Can I still hug you?' and the other said, 'Is it contagious?' I never thought about either of those two things. You just don't know what's going through their mind.  'You do your best, but it's a very difficult thing to navigate.'  The presenter and broadcaster also opened up about having a mastectomy, revealing it was a cathartic experience to say 'goodbye' to her breast. 'First of all, I was calling them 'masectomies' instead of mastectomies... you just don't understand what a mastectomy is - it's the amputation of your breast.  'There are so many different versions of that, so some women can have reconstructions, some women can't have reconstructions, some women like me can have immediate reconstruction because of the type of cancer I had.'  She added: 'I have a silicone implant. The surgeon was able to save my own skin and nipple, which I'm very grateful for.... I said goodbye to my breast... my friend said the best advice she got from a doctor was to say goodbye to your breast. It was really helpful and cathartic.  'It's [a mastectomy] a really traumatic thing and a brutal procedure... there is no nice way to treat cancer, it's pretty horrible.'

Partridge is known for his lack of tact and social awkwardness, with Richard long being famed for his 'Accidental Partridge' moments.  And in an interview with BBC Breakfast on Thursday, Steve also said he reckoned another former Good Morning Britain presenter bared a likeness to Partridge.  'I suppose if you fused Richard Madeley with Piers Morgan, you might get close to who Partridge is at the moment,' he told hosts Naga Munchetty and Charlie Stayt.  'I think Alan likes to think of himself as cutting edge and edgy and relevant.' Steve also revealed that many presenters now help inspire what his character gets up to.  'Almost every presenter has had a Partridge moment, and I sort of galvanise that and chuck it into a bucket marked 'Partridge' and regurgitate it,' he said.  Charlie noted how being compared to Alan Partridge had become 'a badge of honour', Steve said: 'He started out as a buffoon and now there's sort of a bit of affection for him. So although he's misguided and ill-informed, he's not nasty and he's not wicked. He tries to do the right thing. 'When people laugh at Partridge, I think people see a slightly inept uncle or their parents' generation getting things slightly wrong.' Last year, Richard finally revealed what he makes of the constant Partridge comparisons.  In an interview with the Daily Mail, he said he thinks it is 'actually quite funny', but does sometimes think the things he says or does are 'unfairly' taken out of context. 'I honestly don't care at all - it's actually quite funny. It's part and parcel of the job I do,' he said. 'It's so important that you don't take yourself seriously, because you're not gonna have a good time if you do. 'Judy and I started out on This Morning which isn't really hard news. I don't go to war zones, I do popular television, which on the whole is pretty pointless, it's just entertainment. It doesn't mean you're remotely important or interesting.' The I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! contestant added: 'If people wanna take what I say - a quip or a comment - and compare me to Alan Partridge - good luck to them. I think some quotes are often taken so ludicrously out of context that it's a bit unfair.' In recent times, Richard has served up a number of so-called Accidental Partridges as a guest presenter on Good Morning Britain.

Just the idea of wrestling a duvet into a new cover can be enough to make you feel tired. So much so, that men in particular aren't washing them. Half of single men don't wash their bed sheets for up to four months at a time, according to a new survey. And 12% of them admitted to only washing them when they remember.  Pizuna Linens conducted a survey of of 2,250 UK adults over the age of 18 and found that 62% of single women changed their bedding once every two weeks whilst only 29% single men washed their sheets at the same rate. Almost half (45%) of single men said they only washed their sheets every three to four months.  But what happens when you don't change them? Not washing your bed sheets frequently can lead to a host of health problems such as infected wounds and athletes foot, according to Mary Malone, a laundry expert at about.com. According to Malone, during sleep we continue to perspire, meaning body oils and soil are released.  'Infrequent cleaning of sheets and pillowcases allows the fluids to seep into the pillows and mattresses, and those are much more difficult to clean than tossing sheets in the washer,' she told ATTN. Allowing dust, sweat and dirt to build-up for just two weeks can be enough to leave you with a scratchy throat or the sniffles, according to New York University microbiologist Philip Tierno  Leaving your bedsheets unchanged can result in sweat and dirt seeping into your pillows and mattress. So how often should we be changing our sheets? The general consensus is that we should all be changing our sheets - including duvet covers and pillow cases - once a week, Tierno says.  We should be giving our duvet a six-monthly clean or - at the very least - washing it once a year, according to The Fine Bedding Company. Bacteria and bodily fluids can build up in duvets over a short period of time, the company argues, with duvet covers and pyjamas merely acting as a 'first line of defence' against sweat. How you wash your duvet will depend on the type of duvet you have and how big your washing machine is.  Check for care instructions on your duvet first and follow the guidelines. But in general, natural-filled duvets (think: feathers and down) should not be washed and dried at home, regardless of the capacity or capability of your machine. When it comes to synthetic duvets, these are usually fine to wash at home. For larger or higher tog duvets - ie your winter ones - it's usually recommended that they are washed in a large capacity machine.  ",

The prime minister made the erroneous statement during prime minister's questions. He said there were '500,000 more people in paid employment now than there were before the pandemic began'. But according to the Office for National Statistics, there are actually around 500,000 fewer people employed in the UK now than there were pre-Covid.  Between January and March 2020, just as the pandemic began, the ONS said there were 33,012,000 aged 16 and over in employment.   However, between December 2021 and February this year - the most recent period for which figures are available - that number had actually fallen to 32,485,000. The Liberal Democrats have now written to the UK Statistics Authority - which has previously rebuked the PM for making the same misleading claim - urging them to investigate. Christine Jardine, the party's Treasury spokesperson, said: 'By repeating his debunked claim about employment levels, the Prime Minister has onceagain shown he has no respect for the truth. 'Whilst families across the UK are struggling to cope with soaring energy bills and rising prices, Boris Johnson is continuing to misrepresent reality in a desperate attempt to score a good headline. 'The prime minister has brazenly misled parliament yet again and cannot go on. 'He must immediately retract these false claims and be honest with the public - for once in his career.'  The UK Statistics Authority has previously berated the prime minister for wrongly claiming employment levels are higher now than before Covid.    While the number of people on payrolls is higher than before the pandemic, this is more than offset by the number of self-employed people who are no longer working. In a letter to the PM, UK Statistics Authority chair Sir David Norgrove said: 'If, as seems to be the case, your statement referred only to the increase in the number of people on payrolls, it would be a selective use of data that is likely to give a misleading impression of trends in the labour market unless that distinction is carefully explained.'

Nicky Morgan, a former education secretary and women and equalities minister who now sits in the Lords, said she was 'shocked' when she first heard the allegation -- calling it a 'bit of a jaw dropper'. Baroness Morgan said it was not only just an 'extraordinary thing to do' but that there was an 'element of almost aggression about about it as well'. The incident was first revealed at a meeting of Tory MPs on Tuesday night where some female members expressed their concerns about alleged sexual harassment and misconduct in Westminster. On Wednesday night, a Conservative Party spokesperson said the matter was being referred to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). 'Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the chief whip will take appropriate action,' the spokesperson said. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Morgan said that while there was a 'process to go through' regarding the accused, if the allegation was proven they should be expelled from the party as a 'minimum'. Her views were echoed by defence secretary Ben Wallace, who suggested that the MP in question could 'lose the whip... so they could no longer belong to the Conservative Party' 'That usually means they can't be reselected as an MP,' he told the programme. 'If they're a government minister they could lose their job. It would be for the House authorities to define what is an appropriate level of punishment for that type of behaviour.' Morgan also hit out at the 'male culture' that presides in parliament, saying sexism and misogyny was 'not just an issue on Conservative benches' but 'across the House'. She said the fact there were no employment contracts in place gave some MPs a 'feeling of invincibility -- that actually, ultimately it doesn't matter...nobody's actually going to take their job away from them, the job that gives them this sort of status to feel they can do these sorts of things'. Rachel Maclean, the Home Office minister responsible for safeguarding women, also called for the MP to lose their job. Ms Maclean, who was at the meeting on Tuesday where the allegations surfaced, said everyone present had been 'shocked and horrified'. 'It's just gruesome,' she told Sky News's The Take With Sophy Ridge. 'I'm the minister responsible for safeguarding women and for creating laws which protect women against sexual harassment and violence against women and girls, so it is deeply sickening and disgusting to hear that a male MP is watching porn. 'Action needs to be taken and I very much hope... we will see him out of Parliament, out of the party. I hope that's where we get to.' The latest allegation has rocked a Conservative Party that is already under heavy fire following a sexism row over an article about Labour's Angela Rayner in the Mail on Sunday. The newspaper carried quotes from an unnamed Tory MP suggesting the deputy leader deliberately crosses and uncrosses her legs to distract Boris Johnson during prime minister's questions. At the same time, the Sunday Times also revealed that 56 MPs -- including three Cabinet ministers and two Shadow Cabinet ministers -- were being investigated for sexual misconduct. On Thursday the BBC reported that that a female Welsh MP had been described by a Shadow Cabinet member as a 'secret weapon' because 'women want to be her friend and men want to sleep with her'. The Labour Party told the BBC that if a complaint was made it would be taken 'extremely seriously'.",

Well, while the writer has ruled out the idea of penning a second series of the Channel 4 drama, it's been revealed that he did have a spark of an idea for a separate show featuring some of the characters. Speaking at a Bafta TV session, producer Nicola Shindler outlined Russell's idea, explaining (via Metro): 'There was a time when there were a lot of stories in the press about young boys being manipulated online to masturbate. They were being filmed and then they were being blackmailed, essentially. 'It was young teenage boys and it was something that Russell was really concerned about.' She continued: 'It sounds like it's not related at all, except that he thought: 'What if you cut to the present day, and what if Jill and Roscoe are going out there, trying to stop the people who are doing this?'' Admitting she may have revealed too much, Nicola added: 'He just wanted to pick up on that idea that one problem might have gone away, but there are still so many vulnerable people out there who need looking after, or who need some kind of attention shining on them. 'He never wrote any of it - it was a small idea. I don't know if he'll be cross that I've told people what the idea is. He just wanted to pick it up in the present day and say, 'Look, there are still so many people out there who need some kind of protection'. That was the point of it.' It's been well-documented that It's A Sin was originally supposed to have run for eight episodes, though this was eventually cut down to five. Among the scenes that ended up being axed included an epilogue that would have been set in the present day, featuring characters like Jill and Roscoe.",

Vampire devices are electronics that drain a large amount of power even when they're on standby, costing you money.  Households are spending PS2.2bn annually by leaving vampire devices on standby, British Gas research found. This equates to PS147 a year for the average UK household, which is the same as two month's electricity charges.  Most British households will now pay PS1,971 for gas and electricity as energy prices have risen by 54%. Energy UK deputy director Dhara Vyas told BBC News that more bills could be set to rise.  She said: 'We're seeing really high price rises at the minute. We don't know yet for sure, because global gas prices continue to be volatile. Some estimates do say that we're looking at bills of up to PS3,000 this winter.' Since 2009, legislation has required devices to switch into a low power mode (such as standby) after a reasonable amount of time. And since 2013, they must not consume more than 0.5 Watts in standby or in off mode. However, the latest research suggests the small amount of energy appliances do use on standby can still add up (and the total will be greater if you have old appliances in your home).  According to the British Gas research, some devices only need to be plugged in a wall for them to be draining power. Smart speakers, laptops and internet routers all cost to keep plugged in. It costs PS24.61 per year to keep your television on standby, the research found. With an additional PS23.10 for a set-top box, from TV providers like Sky or Virgin Media. Leaving a games console on standby can work out an average of PS12.17, whilst computers could cost around PS11.22 Other devices include:  Microwave: PS16.37 Shower: PS9.80 Washing machine: PS4.73 Printer: PS3.81 Phone charger: PS1.26  'There are smart plugs you can buy which will let you check everything is turned off from your phone,' British Gas energy expert Marc Robson says.

The British star has had a busy couple of years, landing an Oscar nomination for his leading role in the musical Tick, Tick... Boom! and appearing in the biopic The Eyes Of Tammy Faye, which earned Jessica Chastain her first Academy Award win last month. He also reprised the role of Spider-Man for a cameo in the Marvel film No Way Home last year, and is gearing up for the release of his new series Under The Banner Of Heaven. However, now he's nearing the end of a jam-packed run of acting roles, Andrew has shared his intention to put his feet up and take it easy for a bit. 'I'm going to rest for a little bit,' he told Variety when asked what's next for him. 'I need to recalibrate and reconsider what I want to do next and who I want to be and just be a bit of a person for a while.' Noting that awards season can be 'a washing machine', he added: 'I need to just be a bit ordinary for a while.' Sadly, that probably means we won't be seeing Andrew on Strictly in the autumn, despite his recent admission that he's dying to take part. Unless he's throwing us off the scent, of course. Under The Banner Of Heaven unites the former Spider-Man star with Normal People actor Daisy Edgar-Jones. The true crime drama centres around a police officer who is disturbed when he looks into the murder of a mother and her baby daughter and finds links to the Mormon Church. Based on a non-fiction book by Jon Krakauer, it was adapted for the big screen by Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black, whose previous work includes Milk and When We Rise.",

The defence secretary said Britain would do all it could to 'get the limpet off the rock' and ensure Vladimir Putin does not retain any territory in the country. His comments came after foreign secretary Liz Truss said that Russian forces must be pushed out of 'the whole of Ukraine'. Appearing on Sky News, Wallace said Russian president Vladimir Putin had failed in his mission to occupy the whole of Ukraine, so was now trying to retain the territory he has held since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea. He said: 'I think it's certainly the case that Putin, having failed in nearly all its objectives may seek to consolidate what he's got, sort of fortify and dig in, as he did in 2014, and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country of Ukraine and make it very hard for people to move them out of those fortified positions. 'So I think it's really about if we want this to not happen, we have to help Ukrainians effectively get the limpet off the rock and keep the momentum pushing them back.' He added: 'The international community believes Russia should leave Ukraine, the international community has condemned Russia for its invasion of Crimea, which was illegal in 2014. 'We've constantly said that Russia should leave Ukraine sovereign territory so that hasn't changed.' The defence secretary said there was 'a long way to go before Ukraine pushes into Crimea', but that the UK would back them if they chose to do so. 'I think what I would certainly say is, we are supporting Ukraine's sovereign integrity,' he said. 'We've done that all along. That of course includes Crimea. 'But you know, first and foremost, let's get Russia out of where they are now in its invasion plans and help Ukraine resolve and actually remember the Minsk agreement, which Russia has basically ripped up, was all about trying to resolve those two occupied territories. 'But the key thing is to continue to support Ukraine's sovereign integrity and their ability to defend themselves'.",

Not in a film role, the actual Joe Biden In a recent video shared on Twitter, one Donald Trump supporter shared her belief that the US president is, in fact, dead and multiple actors have been standing in for him. After seeing the video featuring Jason Selvig of The Good Liars (a comedy duo that interviews conservative Americans about political matters), the actor - who starred in The Mask - was (almost) all of us in his response. 'Oh dear,' he wrote. The video shows Selvig talking with an American woman who says: 'The guy that's doing the stand-up job of trying to wake people up, is an actor wearing a mask.' 'I mean, there are several different people playing Joe Biden at this point,' she continued. Referring to the moment when Biden fell up the stairs of Air Force One in 2021, she added: 'I myself think that that was Jim Carrey.' She then explained that she believed the actor was 'being silly by falling up the stairs three different times'. 'And James Woods is also I think one of the doppleganger mask-wearing people,' she added. In response to Jim's tweet, The Good Liars wrote: 'Be honest, was the woman we interviewed in this clip just you in a mask?'",
    "75e41d43150589d29aab8c4a7ca8a7a9e4b8d8b9153cfb9e8ca57b78": "The city of York sent a strong message to Prince Andrew on Wednesday that they don't want him as their Duke anymore. Council members voted to remove his Freedom of the City status, an honour he was given in 1986 when he married Sarah Ferguson. Some additionally called on the prince to relinquish his Duke of York title in the aftermath of his now-settled sexual assault civil case with Virginia Giuffre. The decision to strip Andrew of the status was unanimous, according to Darryl Smalley, the City of York Council's executive member for culture, leisure and communities. 'I was pleased to see councillors of all parties support this motion and make it clear that it is no longer appropriate for Prince Andrew to represent York and its residents,' Smalley said. 'The removal of this honorary title sends the right message that we as a city stand with victims of abuse.' But that's not the end of it. Smalley also thinks the prince should 'do the right thing and relinquish his Duke of York title.' Smalley added: 'If he fails to do so, the Government and Buckingham Palace must step in to remove his title to finally end Prince Andrew's connection to York.' Neither Buckingham Palace nor Andrew have commented on the city's decision. Still, it's just the latest disgrace to befall the prince since the settlement was announced in February. In addition, he has been officially stripped of his military affiliations and royal patronages and gave up his honorary membership of the Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, one of the world's most prestigious golf clubs. The prince settled his case with Giuffre in February. She claimed disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein had trafficked her to have sex with Andrew when she was 17, according to the Guardian. The prince has long denied Giuffre's allegations and made no admission of guilt in the settlement, which has been estimated to be more than $10 million (PS7.97 million).",
    "bbb237815e85af58901ff11c0f592db70164479c43a2d21e3de1e84c": "Olivia Wilde's presentation at CinemaCon on Tuesday night turned out to be a family affair -- but not in a good way. The director and actor was onstage at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas discussing Don't Worry Darling, her upcoming thriller starring Harry Styles and Florence Pugh, when an unidentified person came up front, placed a manila envelope on the stage and slid it toward her, according to The Hollywood Reporter. As she picked up the envelope, Wilde asked, 'Is this for me?' Turns out it was. Deadline is reporting that the mystery envelope, which was marked 'personal and confidential,' held custody papers from actor Jason Sudeikis, Wilde's ex-boyfriend and the father of her two children.  Despite the awkward situation, witnesses said Wilde handled the situation like a pro and continued to talk up her film to the audience, which was mostly theatre exhibitors. It is unknown how the person serving the papers got into the event, but CinemaCon official Mitch Neuhauser told Variety that security protocols are going to be reevaluated in light of the incident. An unnamed representative of Sudeikis told HuffPost that the papers were drawn up to 'establish jurisdiction relating to the children of Ms. Wilde and Mr. Sudeikis,' but said the actor had nothing to do with how and when the papers were served. ''Mr. Sudeikis had no prior knowledge of the time or place that the envelope would have been delivered as this would solely be up to the process service company involved and he would never condone her being served in such an inappropriate manner,' the representative said in a statement Wednesday.  Wilde and Sudeikis were together for nine years before splitting at the beginning of 2020. They share two children: son Otis, 6, and daughter Daisy, 4. Sudeikis told GQ last July that figuring out exactly what went wrong in the relationship was going to take him a while.   'I'll have a better understanding of why in a year,' Sudeikis said. 'And an even better one in two, and an even greater one in five, and it'll go from being, you know, a book of my life to becoming a chapter to a paragraph to a line to a word to a doodle.'  ",

There's a reason why the friend to lover trope is so popular in film and TV. You're friends with someone for years, you date other people and then you realise the person you've been looking for has been right in front of you.  Having a solid friendship with someone can be a great foundation for a relationship. But the movies we watch don't tell us how awkward it can be to tell your friend you fancy them. What if they aren't attracted to us? What if it ruins the friendship? This is what this week's reader, Carol, is worried about. 'There's a man that I like and we have been friends for about five years. We are in the same running and wild swimming group and get on well. How can I move out of the 'friend zone'?' she asked.  Though the term 'friend zone' has been debated, there's nothing wrong with exploring the potential of a relationship with a friend - as long as you're fully prepared to accept that they may not reciprocate your feelings.  Though it can be scary to shift the dynamic, Counselling Directory member Simona Bajenaru says we should be honest and authentic. 'Speaking your feelings might be as rewarding as perhaps the hesitation to do so. Whether reciprocated or not, once the initial fear and shame subside, your sense of confidence and pride might blossom,' Bajenaru says. How can we get out of the friend zone?  Bajenaru first invites anyone in this situation to ask yourself five questions:    Why now?    What drives your desire to move out of the 'friend zone'?    What are your expectations, moving out of it?    Would you say he completes or complements you where you are at now?    What feelings come up when you envisage your future together?   Bajenaru emphasis that 'although answering these questions logically is important, digging deeper into your feelings will help clarify whether your desire to advance this relationship is genuine or acting on a temporary need to be fulfilled (company, intimacy) or fear to be satisfied (loneliness, low self-esteem).' In a situation like Carol's - where you usually see the other person in an activity group - asking them if they'd like to meet up one on one for a coffee or drink is probably a good first step.  Why do people struggle to move from friendship to romantic?  'Coming out of the 'friend zone' is terribly scary for most of us,' Bajenaru says. 'Hesitation is a natural reaction to such prospects since a non-reciprocation of your feelings blurs your treasured friendship's way forward. 'Best case scenario, his feelings are mutual and knowing each other well enough provides a beautiful and safe space to nurture the next stage of your relationship. 'The less fortunate scenario may be a slow distancing leading to potentially losing a valued friend, a perhaps abrupt end to his reliable, consistent presence in your life. Should this be the case, please know you have not done anything wrong.' How can we continue a friendship with someone if they don't reciprocate feelings for us? There is an overall risk of awkwardness between yourselves for a while after feelings are shared. 'Sometimes the response is not even immediate: your friend may choose to process his own feelings first. A beautiful placeholder to receive might be 'I am flattered, I need to process it,' Bajenaru says. 'However, they may choose to never respond nor engage, avoiding difficult conversations with you and themselves. Bajenaru adds that 'continuing the friendship would require an honest conversation about the attempt to have more than a friendship and setting some boundaries and perhaps 'ground rules' until some new kind of 'normality' is established.'

    "db239e237ad5f12e897e33f1cf307bc162d4aabee32de40081030240": "Makeup is there to help us look better, or at least like truer versions of our best selves. But for all the products we accumulate on our bathroom shelves, we often don't understand the best way to apply all this stuff. When are fingers OK? When do you need a sponge or brush? And, with so many expensive makeup tool options out there, which ones are worth an investment? We talked to experts to figure it all out and learn some of their favorite techniques. The case for using your fingers Beauty icon Bobbi Brown, founder of Jones Road Beauty, is a proponent of the benefits of skin-to-skin contact. 'Fingers are a makeup artist's go-to because the warmth of fingers melts the product into the skin, giving the most skin-like finish,' she told HuffPost. 'They're also your greatest tool for blending.' Others agree with her. 'Moisturizer, eye cream and other priming products all perform best when worked into the skin with the warmth of fingers,' makeup artist Diane da Silva told HuffPost. While she uses tools for professional work, 'I almost never use them on my own face for my day-to-day personal routine,' she said. 'I keep it very simple and often use the same color blurred onto my eyes, cheeks and lips. An imperfect application can also make it look a bit more believable. Plus, when you allow yourself five minutes for makeup, as I do, there's no time to fuss with tools.' Then there's the issue of cleanliness. As long as you're washing your hands well before applying makeup, fingers can be much cleaner than tools. 'The best of us only wash brushes and sponges thoroughly once a week,' dermatologist Loretta Ciraldo told HuffPost. 'I use my fingers to minimize any chance of spreading microbes that may be growing on brushes or sponges, including fungus, yeast or bacteria. I've even switched to Ilia's Multi-Stick or Merit Flush Balm for blush, since I can apply these directly without using a brush.' When it's best to use makeup brushes Still, makeup artists know the magic that can be achieved with time, talent and the right tools. Brown said, 'When you'd like more coverage on the skin or detail on the eyes, grab your brushes to layer additional product or color where needed.' 'When I'm working on other people, I'm a steadfast brush person,' Fiona Stiles told HuffPost. 'I deeply believe that the right brushes and tools create incredible shortcuts for achieving the look you want to create. So much about makeup is about blending, and tools really make that seamless look possible.' But not all tools are created equal, she said. 'I'm very anti Q-tip, because they leave bits of fluff on the lashes. Instead, I use tightly wound cotton buds, which don't leave cotton behind.' Many makeup artists mix and match application methods for the best results. Sebastien Tardif, co-founder of Veil Cosmetics, told HuffPost that he uses multiple tools, and fingers. One example is liquid concealer. 'I like to use a brush for placement of the product around the eyes, then I use my finger to pat into place as I like the warmth of my finger to melt it with the skin and spread it. Then I finish off the application using a fluffy concealer brush to perfect and blend to get that airbrush-like finish. I might even do one last pat with the fingertip for extra smoothing and locking into place.' Ashley Rebecca told HuffPost, 'I use both tools and my fingers, but for very specific things. For instance, I prefer to apply makeup first with brushes, then soften and lightly blend out the product with my fingers. I find that using a mix of both is really beneficial and yields seamless results.' And then there are those who are firmly Team Brush. 'Makeup brushes are the critical tools that allow you apply the product with precision, or to achieve a unique finish like airbrush,' Jamie Greenberg told HuffPost. 'Fingers are great in a pinch, but brushes will always be my go-to.' For those times when only a makeup tool will do, check out these favorites from makeup artists.

Hark back to the early days of the pandemic where in an effort to get moving, many of us went and downloaded Couch to 5K, the NHS' guided running app. The app takes the runner on nine different runs, incrementally adding time to the exercise so by the end you're able to comfortably run for 30 mins, and hopefully to the distance of 5K. But once you've completed the challenge, what next? Anyone who's finished it will know the excitement and eagerness that comes with wanting to tick off each week on the app. So when you've completed week nine, it can be difficult to muster the same enthusiasm to keep moving.  Don't let nine weeks of expert running go to waste though. There are still ways to motivate yourself to keep up all the good work. Especially as the weather gets warmer, you'll want to get out for a run.  Try a different app For many, a guided run is better than its counterpart - it's always encouraging having someone in your ear telling you you're doing great or that you only have five minutes left. If that's the kind of support you're looking for, there's options such as the Nike Run Club app or Runtastic, which offer stats such as distance, duration, speed, pace, calories burned, elevation gain and heart rate. You can also set yourself a new target - such as 8K or 10K, so you have something to work towards.  Get the gear A good run requires good gear. While you might be used to an old pair of running shoes, might you entice yourself to get back on the pavement with some shiny new gear? If you know you have a stylish pair of trainers, or new Lululemon leggings to break into, a half an hour run might just do the trick.  Sign up to a 5k That might sound a little daunting but remember, before you joined Couch to 5K, the idea of running for 30 consecutive minutes also seemed challenging.  Athlete and HYROX (fitness competition) trainer Jade Skillen says if you sign up to something more difficult, it'll motivate you to keep achieving your goals.  'For somebody who has just completed their first couch to 5km, they should keep motivation high by setting another goal for themselves,' she tells HuffPost. 'Start to look out for the next challenge, this could be using your new found love for running to signing up for a competition or race - be it with yourself or others. This could be a functional fitness event that involves running such as HYROX or striving for a new distance; 10km, half marathon, or whatever you set your mind to.' Give up running No, we don't mean stop exercising. But if you only completed Couch to 5K to feel a sense of achievement, but actually don't enjoy running, then there's no reason to force yourself. You could find a different activity that challenges and excites you and gets your heart rate going. Skillen adds: 'Incorporate some strength and functional training. Compound movements such as deadlifts and squats, plyometric exercises and core stability drills are all great things to add into your training schedule. This is ultimately why focusing on using your running achievements to direct your next challenge is a great way to expand your training methodologies, whilst also keeping up your enjoyment of training and fuelling your motivation.' Go back to Couch to 5K But if all else fails and you're struggling to get back to running without the comfort and familiarity of the NHS app then you could always just go back to it. In its new update you can choose from several celebrities to do your guided run. Theoretically you could do the challenge with a different person each time. That's one way to keep running. Move celebrates exercise in all its forms, with accessible features encouraging you to add movement into your day - because it's not just good for the body, but the mind, too. We get it: workouts can be a bit of a slog, but there are ways you can move more without dreading it. Whether you love hikes, bike rides, YouTube workouts or hula hoop routines, exercise should be something to enjoy.",

And if you really want to impress guests, splash out on Iceland's pork ribs. Those are the just a few of the recommendations you'll find in Good Housekeeping's annual barbecue taste test, which rates the best meat and veggie BBQ products from supermarket brands and grocers.  The panel--which was made up of both expert testers and consumers--blind tasted each product, rating each on their looks, smell, taste and texture. Competition was particularly tight this year, with the panel testing a total of 121 products across all categories.  Planning a barbecue this weekend? Here's where to head for the tastiest food.  Beef burgers Coming out top for beef burgers, Asda's Extra Special 4 Salt and Cracked Black Pepper Beef Burgers (PS3.30 for 4) scored 77/100. The panel applauded the beef burger's bold, umami flavours and well-balanced yet simple seasoning.  Farmison came a very close second with its Hand Press Steak & Bone Marrow Burger (PS10.95 for 4), which scored a respectable 76/100. The tasting panel loved how well the burgers were seasoned, noting the umami notes from the bone marrow. They liked that the burger was deep and complex, being described as both 'meaty' and 'peppery', with a kick of heat.  Flavoured burgers  Asda's beef burgers reign continues with its Extra Special British Beef Burger with Truffle & Parmesan Melt (PS3.00 for 2) voted best in the flavoured burgers category, too, scoring a high 86/100. The panel said that the burger was 'succulent' and 'oh-so indulgent' with a bechamel-like cheese topper, gaining top marks for taste.  The runner-up for flavoured burgers was M&S, with its Chilli Cheese Beef Burger (PS4.50 for 2) which scored 81/100. Testers noted that the burgers had 'a really lovely hit of chilli that pairs well with cheddar', noting that they looked 'indulgent and moreish.'  Sausages The battle of the bangers was won by M&S, thanks to its Bacon & Cheese Sausage Swirl (PS4.50 for 300g) scoring 85/100. This centrepiece is packed with herbs and black pepper, then topped with a glossy BBQ-style sauce. The panel hailed the 'cheesy notes at the fore, with a touch of smokiness to finish', adding that the BBQ sauce was 'sweet and mouth-watering'. It was praised for being 'like a decadent cheesy hotdog in one mouthful, perfect for a big white bap'. Coming in second were the Tesco Finest 4 Pork, Cheese & Jalapeno Hot Dogs (PS2.60 for 400g), scoring 77/100. Taste-wise, these sausages have light spicing and jalapeno tang that builds. The panel liked the faint hint of chives, which adds freshness to the pork and red Leicester.  Kebabs  When it comes to kebabs, Farmison's Yakitori Chicken Skewers (PS10.95 for 4) scored 85/100, taking first place. The Asian influence was spotlighted by the panel, with testers praising the meat for being like a 'classic, spiced, umami-heavy chicken dish in a good quality Japanese restaurant', adding that the pockets of sauce had a great caramelised depth. The chicken is corn-fed and sold pre-marinated, with skewers provided to thread yourself at home.  Aldi did particularly well on the kebabs front, too. The Aldi Ashfields Grill Garlic & Rosemary Lamb Kebabs (PS2.99 for 4) scored 83/100, coming in a close second to Farmison. The panel loved that the skewers had an initial natural sweetness from the lamb, with the mint sauce adding a well-balanced tang. Meat-free Meat-free options have made great strides this year, with a total of 35 products being tested in total. The Beyond Burger (PS4.00 for 2) took the crown for best meat-free burgers, scoring 86/100. The panel unanimously agreed that the burger was an excellent meat replacement, praising the overall flavour for being well-balanced with a lightly smoky aroma.  The runner-up was the Co-op GRO The Bhaji Burger (PS2.50 for 2) scoring 90/100. Packed with veggies and bold, bhaji spices, our panel loved the chilli depth and aromatics at play in this vegan patty.  There were some strong contenders for alternative sausages, too. In first place, with an impressive score of 89/100, was Tesco with its Tesco Plant Chef 6 Cumberland Style Bangers(PS1.75 for 6). The panel loved the black pepper in these sausages, but the winning factor was the texture: the perfect balance of melt-in-the-mouth filling and a crispy skin. THIS Isn't Pork Sausages (PS3.00 for 6) scored 83/100 coming in second, and were hailed for their rich, meaty and 'marmite-like' flavour.  The showstoppers And finally, the panel crowned two 'BBQ heroes' for those who want to really impress guests and add something a little different in the mix.  Iceland's TGI Maple BBQ King Pork Ribs (PS7.00 for 700g) came in first place with a score 90/100, while Asda's Ultimate Extra Special Tomahawk Steak (PS25 for 1kg) was crowned runner up. ",
    "63f9ecd2ebc3e00208937459d9d697dfc2f74b53a39073e6dd6f13b3": "The Conservatives have launched an investigation into claims one of its MPs watched pornography in the House of Commons while sitting next to a female minister. A spokeswoman for Boris Johnson said the frontbencher's behaviour was 'wholly unacceptable' and vowed that the MP concerned would be punished. She said: 'The chief whip is looking into this matter.  'This behaviour is wholly unacceptable and action will be taken.' According to the Sun and Mirror, the unnamed Tory MP was caught watching porn on his mobile phone while sitting next to a female minister in parliament. Female Tory MPs complained about the behaviour at a meeting of Tory parliamentarians on Tuesday night. On Wednesday night, a Conservative Party spokesperson said the matter was being referred to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme. 'Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the chief whip will take appropriate action,' the spokesperson said. Other female MPs at Tuesday night's meeting shared their experiences of harassment and sexism in Westminster. The revelations come just days after a sexism row broke out over a story in the Mail on Sunday about Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. The article, which has been condemned across the political divide, quoted an unnamed Tory MP suggesting that the deputy leader tries to distract the prime minister by crossing and uncrossing her legs. The Sunday Times also revealed that 56 MPs -- including three cabinet ministers and two shadow cabinet ministers -- are under investigation for sexual misconduct. Asked about the misconduct claims in parliament, Johnson said if they were proven then that would be 'grounds for dismissal' for ministers. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said: 'Fifty six members of this House are under investigation for sexual misconduct. That includes three of his cabinet ministers. 'The prime minister has just rightly said that there can be no place for sexism and misogyny in this House, so can he now confirm whether he considers that sexual harassment, apparently unlike bullying and lying, is grounds for dismissal under the ministerial code?' Johnson replied: 'Of course sexual harassment is intolerable and it is quite right that members should now have a procedure by which they can bring that to the attention of the House authorities and I think that is a good thing, and of course it is grounds for dismissal.'",
    "682b8a727c36bfb1bbf1dba926ee0d63e27afea9d34e2a7895707d1a": "Boris Johnson's ethics adviser has cleared Rishi Sunak of breaching the ministerial code over his family's tax affairs. The chancellor referred himself to Lord Geidt after it was revealed that his multi-millionaire wife, Akshata Murty, had 'non-domicile' status, allowing her to avoid paying UK taxes on her foreign income. Following a public backlash, Sunak wrote to Geidt saying he hoped referring his declarations for investigation would provide 'further clarity' for the public. In a letter to Johnson published on Wednesday, Geidt confirmed that he did not believe Sunak had broken the ministerial code. He said: 'I advise that the requirements of the ministerial code have been adhered to by the chancellor and that he has been assiduous in meeting his obligations and in engaging with this investigation. 'In reaching these judgments, I am confined to the question of conflicts of interest and the requirements of the ministerial code. 'My role does not touch on any wider question of the merits of such interests or arrangements.' Sunak was plunged into the centre of a storm when The Independent revealed Murty's non-dom status -- which potentially saved her millions of pounds in UK taxes -- as households up and down the country feel the impact of the rising cost of living. Murty later announced that she would start paying UK rates of tax on her foreign wealth -- derived from her shares in her billionaire father's Indian company Infosys -- to avoid the issue becoming a 'distraction' for her husband. Geidt said he had found two potential instances Murty's tax status 'could have given rise to a conflict of interest' for the chancellor but that 'appropriate steps were taken'. In the first instance he said the issue was properly declared, and in the second -- concerning a proposed change in arrangement for some non-doms -- had no bearing on Murty's interests and that she was unaffected by the change. 'Therefore, in both instances, no conflict arose as a result of Murty's nondomiciled tax status.' Geidt also looked at claims that the chancellor continued to hold a US green card 18 months into his role in No. 11, as well as a blind investment trust set up when he was made chief secretary to the Treasury in July last year.  On the green card issue, Geidt said he did not believe that possessing one would constitute 'an inherent conflict of interest'. 'Being subject to the obligations imposed by the card in his personal life could not reasonably be said to be in tension with the faithful discharge of his duties as chief secretary to the Treasury or as chancellor of the exchequer,' he wrote. The ethics tsar also said he was satisfied that there was no conflict of interest over Sunak's blind investment trust after he was assured by the chancellor that he does not have 'live knowledge' of the contents. Murty's shareholding in Infosys was also 'properly declared', Geidt ruled, adding that it held no contracts with the Treasury while her husband has been at the helm. The saga of Sunak's tax affairs appears to have dented his popularity with Tory party members as well as his chances of succeeding Johnson as PM if he is ousted by MPs angry over partygate. A recent chart compiled by the ConservativeHome website put his net rating at minus 5.2 on April 25 from 7.9 at the start of the month.  A survey by Ipsos taken in early April also found more Britons think Sunak is doing a bad job as chancellor, rather than a good job. Up to 37 per cent now thought Sunak was doing a bad job while 30 per cent said he was doing a good job.  ",

The chancellor said it was better to wait six months until the autumn, when the new energy price cap is set, to see whether costs were still soaring. However, he insisted he was ready to come up with more support then if it was required. Sunak made his comments during a 25-minute interview on Mumsnet. He was asked by a disabled person whether the government would offer more support to cover energy bills.   The chancellor said they had already unveiled a PS9bn package to bring down the cost of electricity and gas, as well as council tax bills. He added: 'Now I know people are anxious about this and wondering if they are going to go up even more, and I have always been clear from the beginning we will see what happens.     'And depending on what happens to bills then, of course, if we need to act and provide support for people, we will.     'But it would be silly to do that now or last month or the month before when we don't know exactly what the situation in the autumn will be.    'So I'd say we'll see where we are with that if we need to do more.' Boris Johnson has called on his ministers to come up with ideas on how to bring down the cost of living. However, Sunak has insisted that any new measures should not cost the Treasury any more money as he seeks to tackle the mounting public debt. The PM chaired a meeting of the cabinet yesterday at which he impressed upon them the need to help people keep more of their money. But his spokesman said: 'He underlined the importance of not feeding in to further inflation rises and emphasised that the UK is currently spending PS80 billion servicing our debt.'  Transport secretary Grant Shapps has proposed that car MOTs take place every two years rather than annually, while the government is also keen on reforming health and safety rules to bring down childcare costs. However, a plan to slash tariffs on things like imported grain in order to reduce food prices has led to a cabinet split. ",

    "d89e685c097d64187dea65cbdea3b3b29f9b7a826c627374c00a0603": "Boris Johnson's cabinet gathered to suggest their 'innovative' ideas for fixing the worsening cost of living crisis on Tuesday - but their solutions have not been met with much enthusiasm. So far, the government has proposed reducing MOTs on cars to just once every two years, rather than keeping it as an annual obligation. Cuts to childcare costs were put on the table too, as ministers considered easing health and safety rules. When pressed about his own ideas at that meeting the follow day, justice secretary Dominic Raab also seemed particularly enthusiastic although he did not actually disclose any of his own plans. However, not everyone shared his excitement about the proposed changes ahead. Torsten Bell, chief executive of Resolution Foundation - a think tank which specialises in living standards - made his opposition to such plans very clear in a scathing Twitter thread of Tuesday. He began by pointing out that if the only answers are childcare reforms and changing MOTs, 'then we have lost the plot'. Here's why. 1. Changes to childcare wouldn't come into effect for 'years' The BBC learned this week that Johnson was particularly keen on reducing childcare costs by easing health and safety rules during Tuesday's meeting. Sources claimed that he wanted to lower the legal limits of adult supervision for children in England. At the moment, there must be at least one staff member for every three children for any groups where the kids are aged two and under. For those over two, there can be one member of staff for every four children. But, as Bell tweeted: 'Whatever you think about watering down childcare regulations to lower costs, it's not an answer to today's crisis. 'Impact would be years off and while it's poor households being crucified by rising energy bills, it's richer households that are more likely to use formal childcare.' Labour's Bridget Phillipson, shadow education secretary, has echoed this message and said the idea would 'drive down quality whilst making no difference to availability'. The Liberal Democrats also accused the prime minister of 'cutting corners' and 'endangering' our children. 2. Changing MOTs won't help those affected by the crisis Transport secretary Grant Shapps proposed reducing annual MOT test to once every two years. All vehicles over three years old need to have a MOT test certificate to check it is safe on the road. This can cost up to PS54.85 for a car. Implementing this measure would therefore save motorists around PS27.43 per year. Bell tweeted: 'More people have cars than kids - and at least targeting the cost of driving is targeted at a source of cost pressures. 'But again, poorer households won't benefit most: a third of poorer households have no care access versus 5% of the richest.' The AA has also argued it will make costs larger in the long run due to higher repair bills and would affect road safety. According to Sky News, a spokesperson for the AA said: 'Though well intended, moving the yearly PS55 spend on an MOT to every two years could make costs worse for drivers with higher repair bills, make our roads more dangerous and would put jobs in the garage industry at risk.' 3. It's energy prices that are the problem Bell said successful policy making is 'recognising the question that needs answering' - and in this case, it's the skyrocketing energy price rises. At the beginning of April, energy regulator Ofgem lifted the energy price cap meaning the average household would see a PS700 increase in its yearly energy bills, and prices are expected to rise again in October. Bank Investec even warned that bills could reach PS3,000 per year as the Ukraine war added to the surging global demand. The Resolution Foundation warned earlier this year that this 'fuel stress' would apply to 6.3 million households across the UK, particularly pensioners and those who live in local authority housing.  The think tank warned then that UK households are facing a 'catastrophe' when it comes to cost of living, while rising food prices and a hike in National Insurance - along with the highest rate of inflation for 30 years - create a high intensity situation. As Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey pointed out, the prime minister seems to be 'completely out of ideas during the most profound crisis in decades'. So what can be done instead? Bell concluded that the cost of living crisis has hit those from low to middle income households the hardest, so the only conclusion is reducing the costs for, or raising the income of, these homes. He added: 'The benefits system is by far the easiest way to do that.' The Lib Dems along with Labour and the SNP have called for an emergency budget and cut in VAT, as well as a proposal for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies' profits. However, such changes seem unlikely as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, appears reluctant to pour any more money in to fix the problem. He just highlighted the PS22 billion he's already announced to reduce energy and council tax bills during the cabinet meeting on Tuesday. The PM's spokesman explained this week: 'He [Sunak] underlined the importance of not feeding into further inflation rises and emphasised that the UK is currently spending PS80 billion servicing our debt.' Johnson has, however, threatened to privatise the Passport Office and other publicly funded organisations if they do not start delivering better value for money. He told TalkTV on Tuesday: 'I'm not going to rule anything out. I don't mind if it's public or private, what I want is to deliver value for money and help keep people's costs down.'",
    "00d6238a7161752a48d20f5d2bb0f04b673ac3c87b42e169e988f4b4": "Boris Johnson has taken a swipe at Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle for trying to summon Mail on Sunday journalists to parliament over the paper's much-criticised report on Angela Rayner. The prime minister's spokesman said his boss was 'uncomfortable' at reporters having to answer to politicians. Hoyle demanded a meeting with the paper's editor, David Dillion, following an outcry over claims the Labour deputy leader crossed and uncrossed her legs during prime minister's Questions to distract Boris Johnson.  But in his reponse to the Speaker, published in sister The Daily Mail newspaper, Dillon said he would not be attending as journalists should 'not take instruction from officials of the House of Commons, however august they may be'. Asked abut the row, the PM's spokesman suggested Johnson was on the side of the newspaper. He said: 'The prime minister is uncomfortable with our free press being summoned by politicians 'We have a free press in this country and reporters must be free to report what they are told as they see fit.' The spokesman said Mr Johnson would not want 'any perception of politicians seeking to in any way curb or control what a free press seeks to report'.  In a statement yesterday, Hoyle said he wanted to use the meeting to ask that 'we are all a little kinder', issuing a plea to reporters to consider the feelings of MPs and their families when covering stories in parliament.  'I firmly believe in the duty of reporters to cover parliament, but I would also make a plea - nothing more - for the feelings of all MPs and their families to be considered, and the impact on their safety, when articles are written. I would just ask that we are all a little kinder.   'That is what I wanted to talk about at tomorrow's meeting.'  Appearing on ITV's Lorraine programme on Tuesday, Rayner said: 'When I heard the story was coming out and we rebutted it instantly... like this is disgusting, it's completely untrue, please don't run a story like that,' she said.   'All I worry about when I'm at the despatch box is doing a good job and being able to do justice to my constituents and the work I'm doing, so I was just really crestfallen that somebody had said that to a paper and a paper was reporting that.'

    "e6bf55ddea5fc3dda8af6e4b3ccff224a9a1c2bfd574981a09a72c45": "Boris Johnson is no stranger to getting his facts wrong in the House of Commons. But even by his standards, he managed to be spectacularly incorrect about the UK job figures during his latest appearance before MPs. At prime minister's questions, Johnson was in bullish form as he rejected Keir Starmer's claims that the government was failing to get to grips with the cost of living crisis. The Labour leader said: 'He sounds like the Comical Ali of the cost of living crisis. He pretends the economy is booming... but in the real world our growth is set to be slower than every G20 country except one - Russia. 'And our inflation is going to be double the rest of the G7. Does he think that denying the facts staring him in the face makes things better or worse for working people?' But the PM hit back, insisting there were '500,000 more people in paid employment now than there were before the pandemic began'. But according to the highly-respected Office for National Statistics, there are actually around 500,000 fewer people employed in the UK now than there were pre-Covid. Between January and March 2020, just as the pandemic began, the ONS said there were 33,012,000 aged 16 and over in employment. But between December 2021 and February this year - the most recent period for which figures are available - that number had actually fallen to 32,485,000. It's not the first time Johnson has been caught out bending the truth about the number of people in work.  The UK Statistics Authority has previously berated the prime minister for wrongly claiming employment levels are higher now than before Covid.  While the number of people on payrolls is higher than before the pandemic, this is more than offset by the number of self-employed people who are no longer working.  Johnson's latest gaffe came just a week after he wrongly claimed that the government is 'cutting taxes for everybody'. But the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think-tank has said this is not true.  The IFS pointedly branded Rishi Sunak a 'fiscal illusionist' last month for claiming to have cut taxes when in fact he was allowing them to go up. ",

The comedian announced that he and Paul had split after three years of marriage and nearly 14 years together in January. Speaking to Lorraine Kelly on Wednesday, Alan said that going on his latest stand-up tour had been like 'therapy' to him following their divorce.  Joking that he and Paul had been together for '207 years' in 'gay years', he said: 'I wrote the tour and then our marriage broke down during Covid, because it was so stressful and everything. 'Then I was going onstage, and I was just like 'this doesn't make sense'.' He continued: 'So we're divorced now. He's excited about the future, I'm excited about the future, but we'll still always be friends because we've been through so much.' He said his latest comedy material on his Regional Trinket tour is 'from the heart', adding: 'It's quite emotional, uplifting and it was actually my therapy really.' Alan and Paul tied the knot in 2018, in a ceremony planned and officiated by their mutual friend Adele.  In a statement announcing their split, a representative said: 'They have jointly and amicably made the difficult decision to divorce and go their separate ways.' Just days later, Paul was jailed after pleading guilty to drink-driving, having reversed a 4x4 into a police car while four times over the limit. He was released after two 'harrowing' nights in custody following a successful appeal against the ruling, with a judge telling him that he should be given the opportunity to turn his life around. In a later update, Paul said it had been 'an exceptionally challenging time' and was going back to his rehabilitation centre to 'keep my journey and progress moving forward'.

Earlier this month, the former This Morning presenter sparked controversy when he responded to a US TV interview with the Duke Of Sussex, in which he said he wanted to make sure the Queen had 'the right people around her'. Discussing Harry on his GB News breakfast show, which he hosts with Isabel Webster, Eamonn said: 'He's bringing a book out where he's slagging off Camilla and maybe William and his father. 'How on earth... why wouldn't they just throw him over the balcony and her with him?' The comments were met with criticism on social media at the time, with TV watchdog Ofcom confirming to HuffPost UK it has received 402 complaints about the broadcast.  As is standard procedure, the complaints will be assessed before Ofcom decides whether to launch an official investigation.  Eamonn, who left his long-standing hosting role on ITV's This Morning in December to join GB News, has long been a critic of the royal couple.  In 2019, he sparked a row after using the word 'uppity' - which historically was used in the US in the 19th Century as an insult to Black people who 'didn't know their place' - to describe the Duchess of Sussex on This Morning.  While it was later reported that Eamonn had been 'reprimanded' for his comments, a spokesperson for ITV denied this, but did say it had been a 'point of learning' for him.   However, Eamonn later said he hadn't 'learnt anything from it'.  He added: 'People can make their own judgment whether they think it was a deliberately racist remark or not, so that's all I have to say about that. People can have their own views on it.' ",
    "00a51082798cd7d3b91e7c3f88e51d441fe249b77147a8e0cda34fbd": "Russia has been accused of 'blackmail' after cutting off its gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria.  This may be a significant turning point in the Ukrainian war, two months after Russia's president Vladimir Putin first ordered an unprovoked attack on its neighbouring nation. Poland and Bulgaria are now looking to find other sources of natural gas and preparing for the reality that Russia could soon block its oil exports, too. But the move is not going to do Russia any favours either. Here's everything we know so far. How is Russia 'blackmailing' European countries? On Wednesday, the majority state-owned Russian gas company, Gazprom, released a statement explaining that it had 'completely suspended gas supplies' going to Poland and Bulgaria. These countries are essential transmit states for the Russian exports. They were warned by the energy giant that if there was any unauthorised withdrawal of gas re-routed to other European countries, their supplies would be reduced by the same amount in retaliation.  In response, Polish gas company PGNiG said it was reserving 'the right to seek compensation', and intends to use 'all available' means to do so.  This dramatic decision from Moscow also comes after repeated Ukrainian appeals for Europe to stop funding the Russian invasion by buying their energy supplies elsewhere. Europe uses Russia for more than a third of its gas, and Gazprom has a monopoly on the pipelines the country, so cutting off Poland and Bulgaria's supplies is an incendiary move from Moscow. Gazprom claims it was following Putin's decree issued last month about how countries should pay for their Russian gas exports.  Why did Putin order this? The Russian president declared in March that all energy payments for Russian gas must be paid in roubles, the Russian currency. This was heavily resisted by European countries, as it would have helped prop up Russia's economy - effectively undoing the strict sanctions placed on the Kremlin over the invasion. The speaker of the lower house of Russia's parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, even encouraged the company to take similar action against other 'unfriendly' nations. What will happen to Poland and Bulgaria? So far, neither nation seems too concerned. Poland's deputy foreign minister Marcin Przydacz declared that Russia was looking to 'foster divisions' between Western allies. Its state gas company has bought 53% of its gas imports from Gazprom this year so far. However, Warsaw claims it can source gas elsewhere (such as Azerbaijan) and it has been preparing for such a situation for years. Poland's PGNiG gas giant said its underground gas storage was close to 80% full and that with summer coming up, it was expecting demand for energy to drop. In Bulgaria, the prime minister Kiril Petkov said the country was reconsidering its contracts with Gazprom, which include moving Russian gas to Serbia and Hungary, pointing out: 'One-sided blackmail was not acceptable.' The country uses Gazprom for 90% of its gas supply but it is looking for alternative sources. For now, no restrictions are in place.  How has the rest of Europe responded? Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff - Andriy Yermak - said that Russia was 'beginning the gas blackmail of Europe', and using its gas supplies as a 'weapon'. He called for the EU to 'impose an embargo on energy resources, depriving the Russians of their energy weapons'. Deputy prime minister Dominic Raab said this move was only contributing to its 'pariah status' by threatening other countries. He told Sky News: 'We will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Polish friends and allies, they've said they can deal with this but of course it will have a very damaging effect on Russia as well. 'Because it is becoming further and further, more and more, not just a political pariah but an economic pariah and that will put the squeeze ultimately on Vladimir Putin. 'But one thing is true and clear. We cannot allow his bullying behaviour, whether it's economic warfare or military warfare, to succeed.' European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen dubbed the move 'blackmail', and warned the EU was coming up with a 'co-ordinated' response to this 'unjustified and unacceptable' act from Russia. However, Slovakia and Hungary have worked out separate deals with Gazprom, by paying a euro-denominated account into Gazprobank which then deposits the amount in roubles. Still, von der Leyen said Moscow's behaviour showed Russia's 'unreliability' as an energy supplier and maintained that the EU is 'prepared' for this. She promised that leaders have been working to 'ensure alternative deliveries and the best possible storage levels across the EU'.",
    "5f5209048b9e9551bdfa3157b57db183773b949d3faccee6e295297c": "The government broke the law by sending hospital patients into care homes at the start of the pandemic, the High Court has ruled. Judges said ministers failed to take into account the risk to elderly and vulnerable residents from non-symptomatic transmission of Covid. Two women, Cathy Gardner and Fay Harris, whose fathers died from virus, had challenged the health secretary and Public Health England over the policy. Lord Justice Bean and Mr Justice Garnham concluded that policies contained in documents released in March and early April 2020 were unlawful. Former health secretary Matt Hancock had claimed the government had put 'a protective ring' around care home residents when the pandemic began. But in their ruling, the judges said: 'In our judgment, this was not a binary question - a choice between on the one hand doing nothing at all, and on the other hand requiring all newly admitted residents to be quarantined. 'The document could, for example, have said that where an asymptomatic patient, other than one who has tested negative, is admitted to a care home, he or she should, so far as practicable, be kept apart from other residents for up to 14 days. 'Since there is no evidence that this question was considered by the Secretary of State, or that he was asked to consider it, it is not an example of a political judgment on a finely balanced issue. 'Nor is it a point on which any of the expert committees had advised that no guidance was required. 'The drafters of the documents of March 17 and April 2 simply failed to take into account the highly relevant consideration of the risk to elderly and vulnerable residents from asymptomatic transmission.' Dr Gardner's 88-year-old father died at a care home in Bicester, Oxfordshire, in April 2020. A barrister representing the two women told the court at a hearing in March that between March and June 2020 more than 20,000 elderly or disabled care home residents had died from Covid-19 in England and Wales. Jason Coppel QC said the fathers of Dr Gardner and Ms Harris were part of that 'toll'. 'The care home population was known to be uniquely vulnerable to being killed or seriously harmed by Covid-19,' said Mr Coppel in a written case outline. 'The Government's failure to protect it, and positive steps taken by the Government which introduced Covid-19 infection into care homes, represent one of the most egregious and devastating policy failures in the modern era.' Mr Coppel told judges: 'That death toll should not and need not have happened.' Charlie Williams, spokesperson for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said: 'I lost my father in a care home back in April 2020. We kept him there because we had been told that no one in the care home had covid, that he would be safe, but later we learned from the staff, who were fantastic, that 27 patients had in fact died from the virus there. 'For the thousands of families like mine who lost loved ones in care homes, the last two years of cover ups and denials have been unbelievably painful. 'We've always known that our loved ones were thrown to the wolves by the government, and the claims made by Matt Hancock that a 'protective ring' was made around care homes was a sickening lie. 'Now a court has found their decisions unlawful and it's clear the decisions taken led to people dying who may otherwise still be with their loved ones today. 'We now need to see those responsible for those dark days held accountable and lessons learned to save lives, ensuring the grim scenes of spring 2020 are never repeated again.'",
    "9f6ae0f8b28b96ea5877daa4e021cfee7c94c6af8a89b18508ce943e": "A Cabinet split over plans to slash tariffs to cut food prices and ease the cost of living crisis has erupted after a senior minister confirmed she was against the move. Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg are reported to be in favour of the proposal, which emerged during a cabinet meeting where ministers were told to come up with their own ideas to help struggling families. It would see import tariffs on some foods, such as rice, slashed as a way to cut food bills and help families make ends meet. But appearing before a committee of MPs today, international trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan dismissed the idea, insisting it would make little difference to prices in the shops. She said: 'All of us across every department are very focused on thinking about exactly how the tools that we have within our own departments, the interfaces with our constituents, where we can find ways to reduce costs. 'In terms of tariffs, it's a tiny, tiny proportion -- 0.4 per cent -- on the cost of living. That isn't really where the key areas are. 'The important things that the DIT [Department for International Trade] is doing in terms of building out with FTAs [free trade agreements] and bringing new markets with more choice for consumers -- that is where DIT has real value in helping bring down the cost of the shopping basket or whatever other aspects of our consumer spending.'  With local council elections just around the corner, the government is under pressure to tackle the rising cost of living which will feature heavily in the May 5 poll. Transport secretary Grant Shapps is understood to have suggested changing MOT checks for drivers from once every year to once every two years in a bid to save people money. Meanwhile, reducing the cost of childcare by increasing the number of children a nursey staff member can look after was also propos by education secretary Nadhim Zahawi.",
    "37f6b8c7d3d471fa67d7ccc10051bfe74546d9305847c6b5d185d322": "Instagram and influencers - it's difficult to imagine one without the other. I've happily followed fashion influencers on Instagram since I first downloaded the app in 2014. And there's no doubt the limited representation of Black women in mainstream media made me feel connected to Black influencers specifically.  These were the people I ran to for makeup recommendations, to ogle their clothing choices and tap up their lifestyle content, from food to travel. I've kept up with everything my favourite influencers are wearing and buying for years. That is, until the pandemic.  It was during lockdown when I started feeling less inclined to scroll influencer content. This was partly because my own life, like many others at the time, wasn't where I wanted it to be. I was job-hunting, while freelancing through a pandemic. It was difficult and I wanted social media to be a form of escapism. But the content I'd once found aspirational began to feel out of touch. Seeing people the same age as me buying things I couldn't afford didn't want to make me want to work harder - it made me feel like I was doing something wrong. I knew the influencers weren't really the problem, but I had to control how they were leaving me feeling. As someone who spends a lot of time on social media, it was up to me to decide which content I wanted to consume.  So I started to unfollow or mute some of their accounts. Like me, Toju, a 21-year old student from Glasgow, also noticed a shift during the Covid lockdowns in how she felt about the influencers she followed. These were the weeks and months when it was easy to think other people had more space, more time, were being more productive or having more fun than you, despite the challenges we were all facing. Remember when it seemed like every past Love Island contestant ever was in Dubai over Christmas 2021? 'During that time, a lot of influencers were travelling or just living very different lives to me,' she says. 'I've also recently felt a shift again this year as more influencers have moved towards luxury or designer items in their content.' More influencers that ever seem to be publishing elevated content, from showcasing their designer clothes and bags to eating out at expensive restaurants and generally living a life of luxury. Of course, this content can be seen variously as aspirational or a form of escapism. It can also make you feel wholly inadequate in the here and now.  The cost of living crisis is playing out in real time. It's hardly surprising Toju and many other social media users no longer feel inspired by influencer accounts. 'I can't even be 'influenced' because these items are simply entirely out of my reach and budget, so I gain nothing but feelings of inadequacy from them,' she says.  'I'm seeing more things that would like to have but can't afford on a daily basis, something I probably wouldn't see if I wasn't on social media.'  But the answer isn't necessarily coming off social media entirely. It could just be changing who you do follow or which platforms you use and for what. Data analyst, Hena J. Bryan, 25, a content creator herself, says that she's put many of the influencers she used to follow on mute for over a year now.  'They just don't align with a lot of the things I find important,' she says. 'I think relatability, for me anyways, goes beyond finances, especially as I can afford the things they're advertising. I want to discover more influencers who offer more than pretty pictures, and I've found a few who speak to my interests.' Bryan creates content about the books she is reading and enjoys engaging with others doing the same. She adds: 'I think people should curate their feed. You literally have to be militant and protect your digital footprint/experience.' It's also worth being aware that how you engage with social media shifts over time. Akachi Priscilla Mbakwe, 23, a marketer from south London has lived online since her early teens. 'I've been following influencers since I was on Tumblr,' she tells HuffPost UK. 'People like Justine Skye who at the time were influencers, but the term wasn't invented yet.' When she was younger, Mbakwe says she followed people 'for aspirational reasons', and for their fashion and make-up content. 'I started to feel different in the pandemic especially during the resurgence of Black Lives Matter. I saw influencers uploading pictures of themselves whist the caption was about George Floyd - they just looked silly to me.' There's self-preservation at play here, too. 'I started to unfollow influencers because I realised subconsciously that I was constantly comparing myself to them,' says Mbakwe. 'Now I have such a better relationship with myself and how I look and I don't want to compromise. 'I still look at them from time to time but not like I used to. Also, now I feel that most influencers make the same content. They're all following the same formula. If you follow one it feels like you follow all of them.' So, where does ultimate responsibility lie: with the followed or their followers? Though the life of an influencer looks perfect, influencers themselves will tell you that sometimes it's far from that. A lot of work goes on behind the scenes and many posters rely on rented or gifted products to project the image they do, some earning little more than the followers who aspire to their lifestyle. 'I don't feel like influencers should change their content to suit us,' weighs in Mbakwe. 'I think we (the consumers) should curate and have better boundaries with our feed if the content you're viewing is making you feel bad.' Bryan echoes this: 'I believe we should all have social responsibility, but we shouldn't have to force influencers to do/say things they don't want to. You're responsible for what you consume and I think TikTok has created a wave of new influencers who don't lend themselves to perfectionism and are more relatable.' With living costs only set to increase, it might be time for be more conscious about the content we choose to see. Arguably Influencers aren't the ones to blame, just a byproduct of a capitalist society that rewards people for flaunting their wealth. You have the power to choose who and what you engage with, so be honest about how your Instagram feed leaves you feeling - and make the changes you need.",

    "9b97931a55242f5b62d540dbab0d770a814d4973cab98fe912379bcf": "Women with asthma in the UK - an estimated three million people - are almost twice as likely to die than men with the condition, according to new research.  Ahead of World Asthma Day, the charity Asthma + Lung UK is launching a report to tackle the stark health inequality that means women are more likely to have the condition, need hospital treatment for it, and die from an asthma attack. Pollen, air pollution and dust are well-known asthma triggers, but people might not know that fluctuations in female sex hormones can also cause asthma symptoms to flare-up or even trigger life-threatening attacks. Asthma + Lung UK is now shining the spotlight on the link between times of hormonal change (during puberty, periods, pregnancy and perimenopause) and asthma symptoms. In childhood, asthma is more prevalent and severe in boys. However, after puberty, the situation reverses, and asthma becomes more prevalent and severe among women.  Over the past five years, more than two thirds of asthma deaths have been women, with more than 5,100 women dying from an asthma attack compared with under 2,300 men. The charity says that women continue to 'draw the short straw' when it comes to research funding and without major investment into targeted research looking into the sex-related differences in asthma, more lives will be cut short. They are also encouraging GPs to explore this potential trigger with any of their patients, for example, considering adjustments to a patient's medication regimen such as increasing the dose of preventer medication if symptoms are worse during hormone fluctuations. For now, Asthma + Lung UK says the best way anyone can protect themselves against asthma triggers, including female hormones, is to take their preventer medicine every day as prescribed and have an asthma review at least once a year to ensure their medicines are working for them and update their action plan. Keeping a symptom diary can also help identify what's triggering someone's asthma, including hormones.  Poppy Hadkinson, 30, a TV presenter from Stratford-upon-Avon, says her asthma worsened when she went through puberty, and she spent her teenage years in and out of hospital with life-threatening asthma attacks.  She said: 'I was diagnosed with asthma aged 11, while going through puberty. Over the next decade, I had regular asthma attacks and would end up in hospital up to six times a year.  'There seemed to be a pattern to my symptoms. Nearly every month in the run up to my period, I'd be really ill with my asthma. I'd struggle to breathe, which was terrifying, and I'd often end up in hospital. The attacks were so severe that I'd been ventilated four times by the time I was 22 and was questioning whether I'd make it to my next birthday. ' Hadkinson, who still experiences asthma symptoms during her periods, was offered a new treatment of a biologic drug which she says was a 'life-saver', and has reduced the hospital visits. She says: 'I lost a large portion of my teenage years and my early 20s to my asthma. I would never want any other woman or girl to experience the same. We need to better understand how asthma affects women so we can find treatments that will give women like me their lives back.'  Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of Asthma + Lung UK, says more needs to be done now.  She said: 'By understanding the role of sex hormones in asthma, we could transform the lives of the three million women with the condition in the UK and the many millions of women with asthma across the world. 'We urgently need to see more investment in research in this area so we can find new treatments and better use existing treatments to help millions of women and save lives.'",
    "695184a3cd060617599b9a4facf5dacfc3b5acd8a602fb21bbd464e8": "Katie Price faces a Crown Court trial after denying breaching a restraining order against her ex-husband's fiancee over a message in which she accused the pair of having an affair. The 43-year-old former glamour model is said to have sent Kieran Hayler a message on January 21 this year in which she branded his new partner, Michelle Penticost, a 'c***ing whore' and a 'gutter slag'. Price, who was known professionally as Jordan, was banned from contacting Penticost directly or indirectly on June 3 2019, under the terms of a five-year restraining order.   She was fined hundreds of pounds for hurling a foul-mouthed 'tirade of abuse' at her during a row in a school playground. Price, wearing white trainers, a green tracksuit and a black gilet, appeared at Crawley Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, accused of contacting Penticost indirectly in breach of the restraining order. She was supported by her reality TV star fiance Carl Woods, 33, who sat in the public gallery. The court heard that her message to Hayler may have been triggered by an Instagram post by Penticost, which she denies was aimed at Price. Price's message read: 'Tell your c***ing whore, piece of shit, girlfriend not to start on me. 'She has a restraining order so shouldn't try antagonise me as she is in breach and I'm sure she doesn't want people knowing that she was having an affair with you behind my back. That gutter slag.' Price, who became a household name around the turn of the millennium, stood in the dock to confirm her name, address and date of birth, before pleading not guilty to the single charge, which can be tried in either the magistrates' court or the Crown Court.   Joe Harrington, defending, said: 'The issues relate to her mental health and the triggers which led to sending that message.' Asked where she wanted the trial to be heard, Price said: 'The Crown Court please.' District Judge Amanda Kelly said the offence carries a maximum sentence of up to five years' imprisonment and warned Price: 'You are in really grave danger of going to prison.' She said: 'This is a very serious allegation in which it is alleged you used indirectly vile and nasty language towards Ms Penticost, someone you were prohibited from contacting directly or indirectly by a restraining order.' The judge granted Price bail ahead of a plea and trial preparation hearing on May 25 at Lewes Crown Court on condition she does not contact Ms Penticost either directly or indirectly, except for handing over children. 'It seems to me, Ms Price, that all of the children caught up in your relationships past and present need their adults to behave like adults,' the judge said. 'Stop exposing them to very public squabbles.'",

During Wednesday's edition of Good Morning Britain, the comedian was asked about the infamous Will Smith drama during this year's Oscars, as someone who became known for taking shots at the stars in attendance while he hosted the Brit Awards. 'I think hosts now going forward are definitely going to be checking themselves every time they write a joke for their monologues thinking that that's happened,' Jack revealed. He later added: 'My piece of advice - and this is what I've always said in awards shows - is just be careful who you pick on.' Addressing Susanna Reid, Jack then referenced the many digs he's made at her former co-host at the Brits, noting: 'You'll notice about me, Susanna, if ever I'm in a room, I always just throw Piers Morgan under the bus over and over again because I know that that's a very safe target. 'Because there's no way Piers would get up onto the stage quick enough to slap me, I would be able to run away in time.' Guest anchor Ed Balls then joked Piers 'wouldn't walk on, he'd walk out', with Jack concluding: 'Shots fired... I don't want to get de-platformed and end up on TalkTV!' Just over a year after his much-publicised exit from GMB, Piers returned to screens on Monday night for the first edition of his new TalkTV show Piers Morgan Uncensored. The inaugural episode featured an interview with former US president Donald Trump, who clashed with Piers over the course of the 70-minute chat, reportedly due to some behind-the-scenes drama between the host and interviewee. Good Morning Britain airs every weekday from 6am on ITV.",

The As It Was singer said he found it hard to trust people as he navigated his private life, after shooting to international to fame at the age of 16 on The X Factor in 2010.  In a candid new interview with Better Homes And Gardens magazine, Harry said: 'For a long time, it felt like the only thing that was mine was my sex life. 'I felt so ashamed about it, ashamed at the idea of people even knowing that I was having sex, let alone who with.' The former One Direction star continued: 'At the time, there were still the kiss-and-tell things. Working out who I could trust was stressful. 'But I think I got to a place where I was like, why do I feel ashamed? I'm a 26-year-old man who's single; it's like, yes, I have sex.' During the interview, Harry, who is now in a relationship with actor and director Olivia Wilde, also addressed conversation surrounding his sexuality, explaining he finds it 'outdated' there is still a pressure to define it.  He added: 'I've been really open with it with my friends, but that's my personal experience - it's mine.  'The whole point of where we should be heading, which is toward accepting everybody and being more open, is that it doesn't matter.' While Harry chooses to keep his romantic life out of the spotlight, he recently discussed what it was like to film his first sex scenes in two forthcoming films, admitting he doesn't think either of the upcoming releases are ones 'you can watch with your parents'. Later this year, the singer will be seen alongside Emma Corrin in a big-screen adaptation of the novel My Policeman, as well as the psychological thriller Don't Worry Darling, which was directed by his partner Olivia.

    "ad6061b8e7f0f94e3078455df45432c2575380f43b762cc86d84722a": "A Soviet-era monument celebrating Ukraine's bond with Russia was destroyed at the command of Kyiv's mayor on Tuesday. The huge bronze statue stood at eight metres tall, and showed a Ukrainian and a Russian worker on a plinth, holding a Soviet order of friendship. It was a symbolic gift from the Soviet Union to commemorate the reunification of Ukraine with Russia, but it had become increasingly controversial over the years as tensions between the countries grew. The monument stood right under the titanium 'People's Friendship Arch', which is still standing. The rainbow-shaped structure stretches up to 50m, and was built in 1982 to honour the 60th anniversary of the Soviet Union. Explaining why he had taken the decision to remove the bronze statue, Kyiv mayor Vitaly Klitschko said: 'We now see what this 'friendship' is - destruction of Ukrainian cities... killing tens of thousands of peaceful people. 'I am convinced such a monument has an entirely different meaning now.' 'This place had a name, the place of friendship between Russia and Ukraine,' he added. 'It's no friendship anymore.' He also pointed out to the BBC that 'Russia destroyed the normal lives of millions of Ukrainians and destroyed the peace in Europe' through its two-month unprovoked attack on the neighbouring nation. The head of the Russian worker was removed first and fell to the ground to cheers from the crowd. The entire statue was then lifted by a crane and lowered to the ground, as 100 people shouted slogans such as 'glory to Ukraine,' according to Reuters news agency. One of the designers of the statue, Serhiy Myrhorodsky, said: 'Russia invaded Ukraine... Can we be friends with Russia? What do you think? 'This is our worst enemy, that is why the monument to Russian-Ukrainian friendship doesn't make sense any more.' One member of the public called Diana, told Reuters: 'We should not have any relations with the nation of aggressors... no friendship, no relations, nothing.' More than five million people have fled from Ukraine since Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February. The metal arch over the statue was altered in 2014 when Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. A crack was painted onto it by activists, to symbolise how Russia's aggression had fractured their relationship. Kyiv has since decided to rename the rainbow-shaped arch and paint it in the colours of the Ukrainian flag. The Kyiv City Council also told a Ukrainian newspaper it was going to change the names of streets linked to Russia and its close ally Belarus. The capital city itself is now widely known as Kyiv, rather than Kiev, because the latter was based on a historical Russian derivation, although Ukraine first implemented this change after it went independent in 1991.",

The Oscar winner has addressed the response to her turn as the former FLOTUS in the anthology series, which follows the parallel lives of three women who made their mark on the White House: Obama, Betty Ford (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Eleanor Roosevelt (Gillian Anderson). Since the show's debut across the pond earlier this month, many viewers have derided Viola's performance for being on the exaggerated side, with critics expressing confusion about her decision to conspicuously purse her lips in certain scenes. Speaking with the BBC in an interview published earlier this week, the actor spoke about the backlash for the first time, saying it was 'incredibly hurtful when people say negative things about your work'. 'Critics absolutely serve no purpose,' Viola told the BBC. 'And I'm not saying that to be nasty, either.' 'They always feel like they're telling you something that you don't know,' she went on. 'Somehow that you're living a life that you're surrounded by people who lie to you, and 'I'm going to be the person that leans in and tells you the truth.' So it gives them an opportunity to be cruel to you.' However, Viola doesn't appear to regret signing on for the role, saying that 'win or fail,' it's her 'job as a leader to make bold choices'.  Said choices have previously paid off for Viola, who is one of the few performers - and the only Black woman - to have won an Oscar, Emmy and Tony award for acting, putting her within reach of the coveted EGOT status.  In contrast to co-stars Michelle and Gillian, who have received notably better reviews for their work in the Showtime series, Viola said portraying a modern-day political figure is an 'almost impossible' challenge.  'Either you're doing too much or not enough,' she told the BBC, adding that she has not had 'any personal contact with Michelle Obama', who has yet to comment on the series.  The First Lady, which wraps up its 10-episode season in June, is just one of many current and upcoming projects for Viola, who also recently released her memoir, Finding Me.  She's next set to star in The Woman King, a historical epic inspired by true events in the Dahomey kingdom, a former West African state in what is now Benin. 'How do you move on from the hurt, from failure?' Viola rhetorically asked the BBC. 'But you have to. Not everything is going to be an awards-worthy performance.'",
    "a8b6de7c0fa70d043816f2049e112134047b41637c5e1c690a855ef9": "You're reading Move, the nudge we need to get active, however makes us happiest and healthiest. Re-establishing your fitness routine after having Covid can have major benefits for your physical and mental health, but it needs to be approached cautiously if you're still experiencing long Covid symptoms.  The NHS advises those experiencing long Covid to ease themselves back into exercise slowly. 'Exercise is very important for regaining your muscle strength and endurance but this needs to be safe and managed alongside other long Covid symptoms,' it says. You can read further information about exercising after Covid infection on the NHS website. Jeannie Di Bon, founder of the Moovlite app, is a movement therapist specialising in working with people experiencing chronic fatigue and chronic pain. More recently, she's been designing workouts for those experiencing long Covid.  'You may find that your energy levels have dropped post-Covid and you may experience fatigue and post-exertion malaise (PEM),' she explains. 'With this in mind, I recommend taking it gently and slowly. We need to keep the nervous system calm to allow the body to repair and we need to start moving without causing a fatigue flare-up.  'Listen to your body and try not to push yourself to pre-Covid fitness too soon. The more you fight the impact of long Covid, the harder it may be to recover.' Below, Di Bon has shared a gentle, five-minute workout created for those who feel ready to start moving again.  But remember, always speak to a healthcare professional about resuming physical activity if you're experiencing chest pain or severe breathlessness, or if physical activity is worsening your long Covid symptoms.  Exercise 1: Belly breathing Start with some gentle belly breathing, allowing the lower ribs to expand. For many people, Covid causes a cough and cold so we want to start moving the lung tissue in the right way. Try to breathe quietly in through the nose and out through the nose. Lying on your back does not require strong inhales so take it very gently, allowing the breath to come to you.  Exercise 2: Arm rolls Staying supine (lying on your back) is a good way to start moving - especially as some people experience dizziness with long Covid. You may find you don't want to be standing for too long or doing exercises that involve inversions or squats. Keep it simple. This arm roll exercise can help stretch into the thorax and open the chest.  Start with your arms by your side. Try to keep the back heavy as you move the arms above your head and gently stretch. Let your breath settle the spine into the floor and allow the tissues to relax. You can add arm circles to this for a beautiful stretch across the chest. Exercise 3: Ankle roll  To help with the dizziness that can happen, some simple leg exercises like calf pumps or ankle circles are recommended. You can do these lying on your back: hold on to one leg and try to circle to the ankle without the rest of the leg moving. Gently lower it back to the ground and repeat on the other leg.  Exercise 4: Resistance training  To build leg strength further, you can add a band for resistance work that is also gentle. This is another great exercise for circulation and helps prevent dizziness. Take a band and place it around your foot with the knee bent. Focus on gentle rolling the back of the thigh along the mat until the leg straightens.  Try not to lock the knee or hang into the band. Keep the energy flowing down the leg into the band. The back stays heavy into the mat - if your back is arching, raise the leg higher. Once the leg is straight, press the balls of the feet into the band and start to point and flex the foot. This is a brilliant way to utilise the calf pump. Exercise 5: Seated twist  A seated twist is great to help circulation and digestion. Many people do experience stomach cramps and pain with Covid. Find a comfortable seated position and cross one leg over the other straight leg. Use your arms to guide yourself around to look over the opposite shoulder. Try to lift the spine up as you twist, rather than compress the spine. It's also important to go gentle and not force into the twist. Stay in the position and breathe softly allowing tight muscles to release. You can then repeat on the other side. Move celebrates exercise in all its forms, with accessible features encouraging you to add movement into your day - because it's not just good for the body, but the mind, too. We get it: workouts can be a bit of a slog, but there are ways you can move more without dreading it. Whether you love hikes, bike rides, YouTube workouts or hula hoop routines, exercise should be something to enjoy.",
    "50ad1ce742194d641eee0bf6005e0a6603bd493b5ac678d14838df04": "With his $44 billion (PS35 billion) to buy Twitter, Elon Musk has a new shiny thing. But unlike so many of Musk's moonshots (self-driving robotaxis, brain-machine interfaces, hyperloops, bulletproof cybertrucks, etc.), Twitter is already a mature product used daily by hundreds of millions of people. And with that comes a set of challenges, including at-times tedious day-to-day managerial tasks, that the world's richest person may not be eager to take on. The shiny new thing could quickly lose its lustre. 'It's like the figurative 'the dog that caught the car' now that he owns Twitter,' William Klepper, an expert on corporate governance and a professor at Columbia Business School, told HuffPost. 'He'll have to provide the executive leadership needed to maintain and grow the company. He can't just hold it in his portfolio!' Inherent in that is respect for Twitter's existing company culture, which Klepper worried Musk may not take the time to understand, much less appreciate and work with. 'Twitter employees were already faced with a pending change,' Klepper said. 'Musk will now increase their disorientation. He would be best to learn how to lead constructive change of an existing company culture -- i.e. the way they do things around Twitter.' In addition to internal managerial concerns, the deal also makes Musk the high-profile face of controversial external choices, including intractable free speech problems at home and abroad. Those problems, and how he chooses to resolve them, present a reputational risk that could spread to other parts of his sprawling technology fiefdom. What happens, for instance, when Vietnam asks Twitter to silence government critics or face reduced access in the country? Will Musk acquiesce in exchange for a deal to open the market to Tesla? And will that taint the perception of Tesla back home? (This isn't a hypothetical: When faced with a highly similar request, Facebook gamely played along.) Those concerns are shared by Brianna Wu, the executive director of Rebellion PAC who has spent years advising Twitter's trust and safety team after being inundated with violent threats on the platform during 'Gamergate' in 2014, some of them so serious she and her husband left their house. Wu told HuffPost there's long been tension at Twitter between doing what's good for users and doing what's good for the company's finances. 'Which makes sense if you think about it, right? A death threat or a rape threat on Twitter is great for engagement,' Wu said. 'Everybody looks at it, everybody says something about it, you know, more eyeballs, more attention, more ads. But it's not good for the user experience.' With Musk at the helm, Wu said she fears profitability and engagement will be prioritised. At the same time, hard-fought, necessary protections for marginalised groups may not be enforced, leading to a resurgence in harassment. 'Musk leads without empathy,' Wu said, 'and the thought of a Twitter leading with even less empathy [than it already does] is terrifying.' Evan Greer, director at Fight for the Future, a digital rights nonprofit, had a similar assessment. 'Content moderation decisions on platforms as consequential as Twitter should be made carefully and through a human rights framework,' Greer said in an emailed statement. 'But over the last several years, major social media platforms have increasingly made changes to their moderation practices based on news cycles and public relations. Now, there is a single human with the power to make changes to Twitter's speech policies. That's not a boon for free expression, it makes a mockery of it. 'It was a problem when Twitter answered to Wall Street. But it's certainly not better if it's run by one billionaire.'",
    "85ef222aa1fe1fa7169ea0381ca86fd0978866c27cd8a875064228fc": "The outcome of the war in Ukraine is 'in the balance', Dominic Raab has warned as he called on the international community to do all it can to ensure Russia is defeated. The deputy prime minister said the West must show 'strategic stamina and staying power' as he claimed the conflict will last for months to come. He also revealed he had held further talks with the international criminal court and said Russian generals should be in no doubt that they will end up 'behind bars' if they commit war crimes. Raab made his comments as foreign secretary Liz Truss prepares to make a keynote speech in which she will call on western nations to increase defence spending and supply tanks and warplanes to Kyiv. Speaking to Sky News, Raab said: 'We want to show maximum solidarity to Ukraine but it's clear that the conflict is in the balance. 'I've said since the first time I came on Sky News I didn't think it would be over in weeks, possibly not even months, so we need the strategic stamina and staying power and I think the prime minister is very conscious of that.' Raab's comments echo those due to be made by Truss in her speech at the Mansion House in the City of London tonight. 'We cannot be complacent - the fate of Ukraine remains in the balance,' she will say. 'And let's be clear - if Putin succeeds there will be untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe. We would never feel safe again. 'So we must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support for Ukraine. 'Heavy weapons, tanks, aeroplanes - digging deep into our inventories, ramping up production. We need to do all of this.' Truss will also call on western nations to spend more money on defence, insisting NATO's target of two per cent of GDP should be 'a floor, not a ceiling'. The UK and its allies must 'reboot, recast and remodel our approach to deterring aggressors' and the war in Ukraine 'has to be a catalyst for wider change', she will say. 'Our new approach will be based on three areas: military strength, economic security and deeper global alliances. 'I want to live in a world where free nations are assertive and in the ascendant... where freedom and democracy are strengthened through a network of economic and security partnerships... where aggressors are contained and moving toward a better path. 'This is the long-term prize: a new era of peace, security and prosperity.'",
    "3253717082197a5bdbc74a17552c55c2664b294cf6a831d4d99a1782": "Ordering beer, wine or a cocktail while flying is a common move. For some, having an alcoholic beverage on the plane is a travel day essential to relax, take the edge off, celebrate a vacation or even to fall asleep on a long flight.  But is this really the best option? Alcohol can leave you groggy and dehydrated. When consumed in excess, it may lower inhibitions and lead to unruly behavior, which we saw a lot of when people reacted negatively to mask mandates. We reached out to some experts in medicine and nutrition, and asked if alcoholic beverages are a good idea while flying. Here's what we found out about how alcohol affects your body while you're up in the air. Is it a bad idea to order alcohol on a flight?  There's no easy answer to this question, experts say. Ordering a beer or wine while flying is a personal decision that might work for one person and not for the person sitting next to them. 'If a person is on edge due to flying in general -- and doesn't become more so with alcohol -- sometimes having a beverage might relax them or make the process feel a little bit more pleasant or more ordinary,' says Wendy Bazilian, a registered dietitian nutritionist. But while some may grab a drink as a celebratory kickoff for a long-awaited trip, others may experience side effects while drinking on a plane. You may not sleep well. It's tempting to order a drink in hopes that it will help you fall asleep and get some much-needed rest on an overnight flight. But this isn't necessarily the greatest idea, according to the experts we spoke to. 'Even though you think it relaxes you, your sleep will be disrupted and you likely will not get into REM sleep, the type of sleep that is restorative,' says Amy Shapiro, a registered dietitian at Real Nutrition. Drinking on a flight doesn't promote restorative sleep but can help some people fall asleep, Bazilian points out. 'If in moderation ... if she or he believes it helps a little to ease into sleep, then that can be fine.' You may become dehydrated. Alcohol is a diuretic, which means your body will increase its output of urine. If you don't drink additional water to make up for this fluid loss, you may quickly become dehydrated, Shapiro said. You may become intoxicated without even realising. 'There is usually very little food available on most flights - or it is not particularly appetising - and it would be easy to drink too much on a relatively empty stomach,' says Dr. Karen Jubanyik, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Yale University School of Medicine. It would be very easy to drink the same amount you drink at home, but without adequate food intake, this amount might be too much, she said.  There's also the fact that most people are pretty sedentary on a flight, rarely leaving their seat. When you do get up, you may find you're feeling the effects of alcohol more than expected. You could become disruptive. We all know that drinking alcohol can lower inhibitions. This could cause an individual to become loud and disrespectful to the flight crew and fellow passengers. People with lowered inhibitions may have a harder time staying calm when annoyed by small inconveniences and actions of people nearby, like a fully reclined seat back. 'If someone has lowered inhibitions, they may speak their mind or start a confrontation with another passenger over relatively small things, which can also land them in trouble,' Jubanyik says. You may have trouble moving around the plane. 'Progressive intoxication can lead to slurred speech, trouble with coordination and trouble walking,' Jubanyik says. 'Just walking to and using the bathroom or exiting the plane could be difficult.'  The good news? You can drink on a flight if you keep some recommendations in mind. Sipping a cocktail while commuting home from a work trip or while en route to a vacation doesn't carry a ton of benefits, but you can still enjoy a drink while flying if it's a behaviour that works for you.  'It can be helpful in relaxing you or easing anxiety in the beginning, and since many people are anxious flyers, this can help,' Shapiro says, while also pointing out that drinking too much can lead to increased anxiety and have a boomerang effect, so it is important to know your limit. Sometimes you may just want to order a drink simply because you feel like having one (many of us regularly do so after work or on the weekends), and this is fine when done in moderation and with a few tips in mind. Don't drink on an empty stomach. If you plan to drink alcohol on a flight, pack some snacks and make sure to eat a meal before boarding if you know there won't be any in-flight food service.  'Eating food alongside alcohol can help maintain energy and steady blood sugar while your body processes the alcohol,' Bazilian says. Stay hydrated. The experts we spoke to recommend alternating each alcoholic drink with at least one or two glasses of water. 'This will help you to remain hydrated and to feel the negative effects less,' Shapiro says. Electrolyte drinks can also help, and if you have the chance, fill up your water bottle in the airport before takeoff. Water and other nonalcoholic drinks aren't always readily available throughout the flight, so sometimes it's just easier to carry your own.  Don't drink if you're going to be renting a car upon arrival. 'It is particularly a bad idea to drink alcohol if you will be renting a car and will need to drive upon arriving at your destination,' Jubanyik says. 'Even if not technically drunk, driving in an unfamiliar location will likely require additional attention and reaction time than one needs in their local environment.' Pace yourself. It's easy to drink quickly on a flight or to grab another drink simply as a way to pass time. Along with staying hydrated and taking a breather between drinks, Bazilian recommends paying close attention to how much alcohol you're consuming. ''Just be aware that one drink [on a flight] may be more than you count as one when you're on the ground.'",
    "32c2750be0dfd3d5a60b041fe59271a88c8671d20fe91d5f8724a4ea": "The Mail on Sunday has rejected a summons from Commons speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle following the newspaper's much-criticised report on Angela Rayner. Hoyle told MPs on Monday he had arranged a meeting with David Dillion, the Sunday newspaper's editor, following an outcry over claims the Labour deputy leader crossed and uncrossed her legs during prime minister's Questions to distract Boris Johnson. Rayner has said she had appealed to the paper not to run the story, based on claims by an unnamed Tory MP. In his reponse to the Speaker, published in sister The Daily Mail newspaper, Dillon said he would not be attending as journalists should 'not take instruction from officials of the House of Commons, however august they may be'. In his letter, he wrote: 'The Mail on Sunday deplores sexism and misogyny in all its forms. However journalists must be free to report what they are told by MPs about conversations which take place in the House of Commons, however unpalatable some may find them.' He said that while The Mail on Sunday had 'the greatest possible respect both for your office and for parliament [which] along with a free press they are the foundation stones of British democracy', the invitation would be declined. Dillon also claimed three more MPs had came forward to privately back up the Mail on Sunday's report that Rayner had been the original source of the story. Earlier, in a statement, Hoyle said he wanted to use the meeting to ask that 'we are all a little kinder', issuing a plea to reporters to consider the feelings of MPs and their families when covering stories in parliament. He made the point that he had only recently rejected calls to remove the parliamentary pass from another journalist after some MPs called for The Mail on Sunday's political editor Glen Owen - who wrote the report about Rayner - to have his pass removed. 'I am a staunch believer and protector of press freedom, which is why when an MP asked me to remove the pass of a sketch writer last week for something he had written, I said 'no',' he said. 'I firmly believe in the duty of reporters to cover parliament, but I would also make a plea - nothing more - for the feelings of all MPs and their families to be considered, and the impact on their safety, when articles are written. I would just ask that we are all a little kinder. 'That is what I wanted to talk about at tomorrow's meeting.' Appearing on ITV's Lorraine programme on Tuesday, Rayner said: 'When I heard the story was coming out and we rebutted it instantly... like this is disgusting, it's completely untrue, please don't run a story like that,' she said. 'All I worry about when I'm at the despatch box is doing a good job and being able to do justice to my constituents and the work I'm doing, so I was just really crestfallen that somebody had said that to a paper and a paper was reporting that.'",

Elon Musk was urged to come to the Brexiteer's rescue as the ex-Ukip and Brexit Party leader complained in a video about having 'zero growth' for 18 months with his Twitter engagement falling to an 'all-time low'. But Farage received little sympathy on Twitter itself as many suggested it was perhaps a result of his increasing irrelevance in politics seven years after the Brexit vote, and more than a year since the UK left the European Union's single market. He said: 'Within the last few years (growth) has completely stopped. 'I've had no growth on Twitter whatsoever, the stuff I put out and say gets seen by far fewer people. 'Now it could be that my stuff is really dull and boring and I have nothing interesting to say, no original thoughts whatsoever.' With a nervous laugh, he added: 'I don't actually think that is the case.' Farage went on to admit he didn't know how algorithms worked before calling on Musk to 'drain the Twitter swamp'. 'If anyone can do it, it's this guy,' he added. Many people made a similar point about Farage being perhaps past his sell-by-date.",
    "a0d90d263d7dd5fc77c8f7c72c61c64fe4374892f26caf387272303c": "Boris Johnson has threatened to 'privatise the arse' out of arm's length government agencies amid passport and driving licence delays, as he criticised 'post-Covid manana culture' at some public bodies.  The prime minister put the Passport Office, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and other publicly-funded organisations on notice in comments to Cabinet ministers, according to a source who attended Tuesday's meeting. Johnson is understood to be 'horrified' at the backlog in dealing with passport applications and will summon the agency's leadership for urgent talks at No 10 on Thursday.   He is said to be concerned that families wanting to go on summer holidays are under pressure to pay up to PS100 extra per passport for fast-track applications because of delays. The source cautioned that privatisation would not be the starting point, but warned that Downing Street could look to businesses to take over if passport bosses could not meet the 10-week target for standard applications costing PS75.50. As well as the Passport Office, MPs have been raising concerns over significant delays in turning round applications for licences at the DVLA. When interviewed on TalkTV, Johnson admitted using the phrasing and stood by the reported threat, tell Tom Newton Dunn that 'we all got used to working from home, to zoom calls, to thinking that we could do business like that'. He said: 'I don't care if an institution is in the private or the public sector, I just want it to deliver value and a good service. 'I think that we all, as public servants, I as the as the leader of the whole of the public service in this country, have to recognise that we've been through a very difficult time. 'We supported businesses with huge sums of taxpayers' money, PS408 billion, but we're now facing tougher economic times.' Pressed again, Johnson said: 'I'm not going to rule anything out. I don't mind if it's public or private, what I want is to deliver value for money and help keep people's costs down.'  Last week, Jacob Rees-Mogg was labelled a 'nasty patronising man' after leaving notes on the desks of civil servants who were not in the office as part of efforts for a 'rapid return' of officials to their Whitehall desks.  Downing Street chief of staff Steve Barclay is expected to meet with the Passport Office official later this week.   The prime minister's official spokesman would not comment on Cabinet leaks, but told reporters: 'The prime minister is adamant this is a serious issue facing families and it's one that needs to be gripped. 'That's his focus and he is ensuring that those responsible will be asked to make sure they are doing everything possible to clear this backlog and help hard-working families get their passports, get on holiday.' In response to the criticism, a spokesperson for HM Passport Office said: 'Since April 2021, we have been advising people to allow up to 10 weeks when applying for their British passport as more than five million people delayed applying due to the pandemic.   'We urge people who need a new passport to apply for one as soon as possible, with the vast majority of all passport applications being dealt with well within 10 weeks. 'To deal with this demand, we have increased staff numbers by 500 since April 2021. This has helped us to handle more applications than ever before, with more than one million passport applications processed in March 2022.' The PCS union condemned the prime minister's suggestion that HM Passport Office could be privatised. General secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'It is absurd for Boris Johnson to threaten to privatise HMPO, when it is clear that the current problems are mainly down to the casualisation of the workforce.' It as also reported another idea under consideration following Cabinet is allowing cars to undergo an MOT every two years, rather than annually.",

The photos have been shared by a Twitter user who claims their father sent them from the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. It has been under siege for weeks, and is now almost completely under Russian control. The scenes in the city have been harrowing. Troops appeared to attack a Mariupol theatre in March when the general public were using it as a bomb shelter. The city is also thought to have endured the greatest number of civilian deaths out of all of Ukraine at the hands of the Russian troops. Now, Russian president Vladimir Putin has claimed victory in the city, even though the Ukrainian soldiers on the ground have contested this. There is one final stronghold still fighting back, in Azovstal steelworks. Putin called his plans to attack this stronghold because he was concerned there would be too many Russian casualties, according to the Ministry of Defence. Mariupol has been so damaged by Putin's forces that the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the whole city had been completely 'destroyed' earlier this month, with 'tens of thousands' dead. The destruction in Mariupol adds to the growing accusations of war crimes said to have been committed in Ukraine by Russian troops. Here is just a handful of the images being shared on Twitter. Some of the photos compared how the city looked like a century ago, a year ago, and then today.  Another highlighted the architectural monument known as the Continental Hotel. 'We will all come back and make the city even better than it was,' one caption promised. 'We will preserve the historical heritage that remains, and we will forever remember who our real brothers are.' But other images show the extent of the damage. This caption reads: 'The central artery of the city in both directions. [Russia] burned everything down, destroyed it, and stole it.' More than 6,000 cases of potential war crimes have been opened by Ukraine's prosecutor general.",
    "e30800de35bdae0e297dec7e9c9ee7c067ac808ed215c4a296080dbf": "A bungled LGBTQ+ conference that the government was forced to cancel may cost more than half a million pounds, it was revealed today.  The UK's first-ever international LGBTQ+ conference was canned after more than 100 organisations pulled out in a row over conversion therapy. The 'Safe To Be Me' event was scheduled to take place in London in June to promote LGBTQ+ rights within the UK and globally.  However, charities and groups boycotted the event when the government excluded transgender people from their ban on conversion therapy.  The controversy even sparked fury from some Tory MPs who called on the government to 'have some empathy'. Conversion therapy is an attempt to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity and can involve methods such as aversive stimulation or religious counselling. Now equalities minister Mike Freer has revealed the government predicts it will cost between PS410,000 to PS610,000.  Answering a question from Labour's Anneliese Dodds, he said: 'We announced our decision to cancel Safe To Be Me: A Global Equality Conference on 6 April 2022. Expenditure to that point, and due to the cancellation, is estimated to be between PS0.41 million and PS0.61 million. 'We are engaging our suppliers to determine whether any costs can be recovered for work that had not yet been undertaken. We are also exploring whether any commitments made could be deferred to support future government events.' A source stressed that part of the cost related to a deposit on a venue and that the government was looking at whether it could be used for a separate event or if any of the deposit was recoverable. They said that could mean the costs incurred would end up being less. Dodds, the shadow women and equalities secretary, told HuffPost UK: 'While millions of British people are struggling with the cost of living crisis, the government has frittered away at least half a million pounds on an international LGBT conference that collapsed because of their own failure to stand up for LGBT+ rights. 'Ministers must now set out exactly how much public money has been flushed down the drain because of this debacle and what steps they are going to take to repair trust with the LGBT+ community.' The huge row over conversion therapy also saw the government's first LGBTQ+ business champion resign. The unpaid role was created especially in the lead-up to the conference, and was expected to last at least 18 months. But Iain Anderson resigned, criticising the 'deeply damaging' move to exclude trans people from protection against conversion therapy. Boris Johnson previously described gay conversion therapy as 'utterly abhorrent' but claimed there were 'complexities and sensitivities' when 'you move from the area of sexuality to the question of gender'. HuffPost UK has contacted the government for comment.  ",

For mums and dads wanting someone to take care of their children while they work, fees are sky high. But as one mum showed on social media, it's not the case for countries around the world. Sharmaine Lovegrove, a publisher at Dialogue Books, shared on social media that in Berlin, Germany where she lives, the cost of childcare is EUR23 (PS19.35) per child. And she has twins, so that's a mere EUR46 (PS38.69) per month.  The mum said for that price, the nursery offers two childminders, two naps, two snacks a day, a dog to play with, all organic lunch, and trips to the park. Germany enjoys affordable prices for childminding and government subsidiaries are also available, particularly for low income families. By comparison, the UK costs thousands of pounds for the same services. In fact, almost two thirds of families are paying more, or the same, for their childcare as they do their rent or mortgage, according to a survey of 27,000 parents of young children. In the survey by online forum Mumsnet and the charity Pregnant Then Screwed, one in four parents say they had to cut down on food, heat and clothing to afford childcare. It found that 62% of parents say the cost of childcare is now the same or more than their domestic costs. This rose to 73% among single parents and parents who work full-time, with high childcare costs being a key driver for women pushed into low-paid, part-time work. Seeing the prices paid by parents in Germany left many UK parents freshly incensed at the extortionate fees in the UK. The stark difference speaks to the campaigns that Pregnant Then Screwed has relentlessly pushed in the UK, advocating for better childcare provisions. The charity's founder, Joeli Brearley, previously commented about the crisis: 'The government's approach to childcare just is not working. Time and time again research shows that if the government were to invest in a good quality childcare system, it would pay for itself through increased taxes, but it also decreases the attainment gap between the richest and the poorest children.  'Childcare investment reduces the welfare bill, gets more people into work, improves the skills shortage and has long term benefits for children. They don't understand that this isn't just a women's issue, it's an economic issue. The government says they want to support hard working families, but families don't work without childcare.'",

The Radio 2 DJ, who appeared on the BBC ballroom show in 2013, admitted to seeing her dance partner in a different light than just a choreographical one during a phone-in on Tuesday's This Morning.  After one viewer told of how her husband had learned to dance with her to help keep the spark alive in their marriage, Holly noted how 'it works on Strictly'.  'Maybe dancing is the key!' she added.  Vanessa responded: 'Exactly, it works a bit too well on Strictly. I do remember when James Jordan said to me, 'I put my uh, uh on top of your fufu,' I thought, 'blimey'.' Holly and Phil's faces were priceless, as Vanessa continued: 'For at least a day, I was deeply in love with him... the idea of his and mine... that whole thing in rhythm. 'Dancing is physical, active, sexy, you've got to look at each other and smoulder a bit. Everything about that is a good thing to do, everything is great.' Vanessa and James were the second couple to be eliminated from the 11th series of Strictly.  The presenter, who has been with partner Ben Ofoedu since 2006, previously told of temporarily falling under James' spell in her Daily Express column.  Writing in 2018, she said: 'I lurched back to my senses, remembered I was on a TV show, gave myself a stern talking to and snapped back to being a grown-up. 'I must add it most definitely helped that my own Other Half Ben is not only hugely understanding but a bit of all right!' However, Vanessa admitted she understood how the so-called 'Strictly curse' can take hold, adding: 'I don't think you have to be unhappy in your relationship to fall victim to the Strictly curse. 'We are all susceptible to attention, the allure of another human's unbroken fascination with us and the joy of melting into the outstretched arms of a gorgeous stranger who rapidly morphs into a treasured friend. You have to be strong to resist such an alluring combination.' This Morning airs every weekday from 10am on ITV.",

The transport secretary said he was 'not an absolutist' as he insisted Zoom calls were often 'more convenient' than meeting face-to-face. Government efficiency minister Rees-Mogg sparked a backlash by placing letters on empty desks in his department saying he 'looked forward to seeing you in the office very soon'. Culture secretary Nadine Dorries branded his approach 'Dickensian' as she insisted civil service productivity was more important than their place of work. However, Boris Johnson's spokesman gave his backing to Rees-Mogg, saying the prime minister 'supports any initiative that encourages people to return to pre-pandemic working'. Asked for his views on Times Radio, Shapps said he was 'a pragmatist on these things'. He said: 'I'm very conscious that at the DfT [Department for Transport], 1,000 new colleagues have joined since coronavirus. 'Some of those will never have had the opportunity to meet face to face with the people they're working with every day. So particularly for younger people, having that ability to meet face to face and have the coffee machine conversation is incredibly important. 'But I'm not an absolutist. I think we recognise that some meetings are just faster and more efficient when you can jump on [Zoom] like us right now, for example. We are down the line and it's just more convenient. 'And I do recognise the importance of departments coming back and the DfT have been fairly enthusiastic about coming back in as well.' It emerged last week that Rees-Mogg had been going round his department putting letters on empty desks which said: 'Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon. Wish every good wish.'  But Dorries reportedly described the tactic as 'Dickensian'. 'Why are we measuring bodies behind desks? Why aren't we measuring productivity?' she said. Union leaders have also hit out at Rees-Mogg, with Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA representing senior civil servants, describing it as 'vindictive'. ",

Priti Patel attended the No Time To Die premiere in London's Royal Albert Hall last year after accepting tickets thought to be worth thousands of pounds. Standards committee chairman Chris Bryant was questioning Patel's fellow ministers about her appearance in a debate about why MPs accept hospitality, and how they declare it. He asked: 'Priti Patel went to the Bond premiere on September 28, 2021, as a guest of the Jamaica tourist board.  'She declared that not through the house, but through her department [the home office]. ''Why is that in her ministerial capacity?' 'I don't know the influence, in terms of her constituency,' leader of the Commons, Mark Spencer, replied. 'I don't know if there's a huge Jamaican population.' 'Why is it in her ministerial capacity?' Bryant asked again. Spencer said: ''I think it's fairly obvious she was invited there as the home secretary.' Bryant continued: 'Why is the home secretary being invited for whatever it is, PS2,000 tickets - you don't declare an amount when it's done through a ministerial capacity as in essence, a minister gets to decide where to register it.' Bryant asked again: 'What's a Bond premiere got to do with her role as home secretary?' 'Well the nature of the film, one could argue, is connected to executive function,' paymaster general Michael Ellis said. Bryant laughed in disbelief, and said: 'What?' Ellis continued: 'It's a matter for her though, Mr Bryant, individual cases not withstanding.' Spencer added: ''The fact that we know about that is because it was logged, registered, and is now in the public domain. That demonstrates that the system works.' As Bryant pointed out: 'It would have been in the public domain if she had registered it in the house.' Bryant has developed a reputation for taking on the government in recent months. In February, he hit headlines for calling out Boris Johnson when the Labour MP was in the middle of putting a question to him over Russian sanctions. He also held foreign secretary Liz Truss to account over Ukrainian refugee numbers last month, asking her: 'Are you not ashamed?'",

In allegations made to the BBC and the Guardian, the 64-year-old former BBC Radio 1 presenter has been accused of misusing his position in the music industry to take advantage of seven women who were in their late teens or early 20s at the time. Three women accused the DJ of opportunistic and predatory sexual behaviour, while four others alleged they were groped by him at events, according to the Guardian.   A statement from Westwood's representative to the PA news agency said: 'Tim Westwood strongly denies all allegations of inappropriate behaviour.

The estate agent and many of her co-stars and colleagues have been involved in a long-running feud with Christine Quinn, with the drama continuing to take centre stage in the fifth season, which dropped last week. In a video on her Instagram Stories, Chrishell has addressed comments directed to her, insisting she doesn't always 'have to be nice if somebody keeps pushing you and does not respect your boundaries'. She said: 'I just wanted to address something real quick. Every single season I see this common thing every time [with people claiming] that I'm actually not really nice, that I'm fake nice, that I'm actually a bully, or whatever. 'To all the nice girls out there, listen. You try and be nice, you try and do the right thing... I've worked in this business a long time. I've kept so many friendships, I try and always be professional.

This prediction is based off new research from data analytics company Kantar, which said our groceries are now 5.9% more expensive than they were back in April 2021. So why are they changing - and can we do anything about it? Why are food bills climbing? Kantar's head of retail and consumer insight Fraser McKevitt said people are having to spend more on 'non-discretionary, everyday essentials which will prove difficult to cut back on as budgets are squeezed'. This comes down to several, complicated issues which have contributed to the current cost of living crisis. The Ukrainian war is playing a significant role in reducing the available food resources, as distribution lines from Ukraine and Russia face major disruption to mainstream items such as cooking oil. Prices everywhere in the UK are also rising at their fastest rate for 30 years due to inflation, as companies pass their growing production and distribution costs onto customers. For instance, Nestle , the food and drink giant, has increased all of its prices by more than 5% in the last three months. The prices of various items such as dog food, fresh lamb and savoury snacks are on the up as well, according to Kantar, while previous reports have pointed out how basics like meat, coffee and pasta are getting more expensive. Milk is set to become more expensive because the cost of feeding cattle rising - this comes down to the climbing costs of labour and oil, which then affects energy bills. The knock-on effect of Covid and the so-called Great Resignation has led to staff shortages too, while Brexit also meant a significant portion of the workforce left the UK. On top of all of this, various weather conditions in some parts of the world can be blamed. Drought and high temperatures have affected various crops such as wheat and rapeseed, reducing farmers' yield so less produce reaches the shelves. People are choosing budget supermarkets instead Kantar pointed out that Aldi has become the fastest growing retailer this year, with its sales increasing by 4.2% in the three months leading up to April 17. Hot on its heels was fellow cost-cutting supermarket Lidl, which saw a 4% climb in sales. The researchers found that more than one million additional shoppers hit these two supermarkets compared to April 2021 - news which comes just after Morrison and Asda vowed to cut prices on hundreds of their items as they look to regain customers. Iceland boss Richard Walker has also told the BBC he is looking at introducing an influx of deals to help the public with the cost of living crisis. How is this affecting supermarket sales? Kantar pointed out that there is evidence of people stocking up due to limited availability. Tesco, Waitrose and Morrisons have even put a limit on how much cooking oil people can buy, as most of the UK's sunflower oil comes from Ukraine. Walker - from Iceland - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It is not as frenzied as the toilet roll panic buying from a couple of years ago, and we are managing to maintain an offer. 'But yes, we are limiting purchases and we've moved into smaller packs to allow existing stocks in the market to service more customers.' Despite this clear demand, supermarket sales have actually fallen by 0.6% compared to the profits seen during the first lockdown, a time when only essential shops were open. Online grocery sales have dropped by almost 15% when compared to last year when social distancing restrictions were still in place. People are thought to be buying less now that the hospitality industry has opened up once again. McKevitt said this is to be 'expected', adding: 'While the number of trips we're making to the supermarket has remained steady this year, people aren't buying as much when in store and the average basket size has dropped by 4.5% to PS22.39.' Does the government have a plan? Boris Johnson did call a cabinet meeting on Tuesday to redirect the government's focus away from partygate and onto the cost of living crisis.  However, chancellor Rishi Sunak is reportedly reluctant to spend any more to help the public with their bills, so it would appear a solution is yet to be found.",
    "98b55c776e894e7c4c6507eda8d6889a5ce3bbd4d04038fd855a8776": "Around a million women rely on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in Britain, but nationwide shortages are causing disruption and distress across the country. HRT is prescribed primarily to help combat perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms, which include anxiety, joint pain, disturbed sleep and hot flushes. The drugs are also vital for the trans women prescribed them to alter their hormones, though experts have said the number of trans women taking HRT is very small, and is not a contributing factor towards the shortage. Acute shortages have reportedly caused women to share prescriptions, with some said to be made suicidal by the debilitating symptoms they suffer without the medications. Women have also reported travelling hundreds of miles between pharmacies to access their prescriptions.  Here's what's happening and what's being done about it:  Why is there a HRT shortage?  The number of people requesting HRT has increased rapidly in recent years in a trend dubbed 'the Davina effect', after presenter Davina McCall created a documentary to break down the stigma associated with HRT and dispel some myths about its safety. She also campaigned for HRT prescription costs to be cut to allow more women to access the treatment.  Recent figures suggest the number of HRT prescriptions in the UK has more doubled in the last five years but stocks are running low, with Besins Healthcare - the manufacturer of a commonly-used hormone replacement gel Oestrogel -reporting supply problems. What do pharmacies have to do with it?  The Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) is calling on Sajid Javid to allow pharmacists to dispense substitute versions of prescription medicines. Claire Anderson, the president of RPS, told the Guardian that current laws in England stipulate that community pharmacists must provide the exact product and amount of medication on the prescription. If the type of HRT product is not available, a substitute cannot be given out without consulting the GP who prescribed the medicine.  'At the moment pharmacists cannot amend prescriptions for HRT, so have to refer women back to their GPs when a medicine is not available,' Anderson said. 'Enabling pharmacists to do so will save time for patients, pharmacists and doctors, as well as lessening the anxiety for women waiting for medicines.' What is the government doing about it?  The government has announced it will be appointing HRT tsar with orders to solve the shortage. Sajid Javid told The Mail on Sunday he was 'determined' to make sure supplies were meeting the high demand and would use lessons learned during the Covid-19 vaccine rollout. 'I will be urgently convening a meeting with suppliers to look at ways we can work together to improve supply in the short and long term,' he said. 'It's also clear to me that we need to apply some of the lessons from the vaccine taskforce to this challenge, so we will soon be recruiting for an HRT supply chairperson.' What advice is there for women struggling to access HRT?  The British Medical Society advises women who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining Oestrogel to consider equivalent alternative HRT preparations. 'This could include Sandrena gel (0.5mg or 1mg) or Lenzetto spray preparations,' a statement on their site reads.  'Prescribers should consider using equivalent preparations to those that their patients are currently using. If an exact match is not possible, prescribers can seek guidance available on the BMS website to clarify equivalent doses.' Dee Murray, CEO and founder of Menopause Experts Group, has said women should only take HRT under the advice of a health professional.   'The HRT shortage is causing stress and potential harm for women, with some pushed to take matters into their own hands and look for supplies online,' she said.  'This could have a devastating impact on their health, as HRT should only be prescribed by qualified healthcare practitioners who understand the patient's history.' She also advised taking steps to 'survive without HRT', which include practising mindfulness to reduce stress, cutting down on problem foods that trigger migraines or contribute towards poor sleep (such as caffeine or alcohol) and reducing excess weight which can heighten menopause symptoms.  Again, speak to a medical professional before making drastic lifestyle changes. ",
    "3ce75805df75851fdc60263558cd5c2ad454fac60f1d6bc183fb17e6": "Number 10 this morning unveiled Boris Johnson's big plan for tackling the cost of living. The prime minister will - wait for it - chair a meeting of the government's long-forgotten-about domestic and economic strategy committee 'in the coming weeks'.  There, he and senior ministers will apparently sign off on policies to help voters tackle their soaring bills. Except chancellor Rishi Sunak is refusing to release any more cash to pay for them. As workers begin to see the rise in national insurance hit their pay packets, at the same time as their energy, food and council tax bills soar, they will be forgiven for thinking the government has completely run out of ideas on how to help them. Johnson chaired this morning's cabinet, where we are told he 'led a productive discussion on the government's work to help people keep more of their money in the face of global price hikes' And in case you were tempted to blame the PM and his team for the state of the economy, Number 10 were keen to point the finger at 'continued disruptions in the global economy' caused by Covid lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine. The PM told his ministers 'there was more to do' to help hard-pressed Brits, but was noticeably silent on what that might be. Instead, Sunak highlighted the PS22bn-worth of measures he's already announced to reduce energy and council tax bills, but made it clear that the cupboard is pretty bare if anyone is expecting a further spending splurge. 'He underlined the importance of not feeding in to further inflation rises and emphasised that the UK is currently spending PS80 billion servicing our debt,' said the PM's spokesman. So if you're a public sector worker looking for a pay rise to help keep up with the soaring rate of inflation, think again. With the local elections just nine days away, and the partygate row rumbling on, any Tories hoping for some big policy ideas to dig them out of a hole will be sadly disappointed. A bit like the rest of the country, really.",

If that's the case and you're planning to get travel abroad this summer or another point during the year, you might want to get the application in as soon as possible. That's because there's a bit of a passport crisis happening right now, as there's a huge demand in applications for renewal, after five million people delayed getting theirs during the pandemic. Now as Covid restrictions have lifted, millions are rushing to get their documents renewed, but facing lengthy waiting times. Where it would previously take three weeks for a new passport to arrive, the wait time has increased to 10 weeks. However, not everyone is receiving theirs within this time frame either, as some report waiting months for theirs to arrive. Post-Brexit travel rules which say Brits need to have at least three months remaining on their passport expiry also complicate the process. But MPs aren't happy about the situation and accused the Passport Office of presiding over an 'absolute shambles'. They told the commons their constituents were missing holidays, funerals, and important plans. Stuart McDonald, the SNP's home affairs spokesman, told The Times: 'All our constituents are having to cancel holidays, miss funerals, rearrange visits, with even a new 10-week target routinely being failed. What will be done to avoid this predictable mess getting worse? And can we be assured that the 10-week target will not be lengthened further as we approach the summer?' Ministers are now urging people to start the process as soon as possible. Kevin Foster, the immigration minister, said: 'We would advise people this is a very -- virtually unprecedented -- surge in demand, and if people are planning to travel this summer we would advise them to get their application in as soon as possible.' But the minister added that applications for special circumstances can be expedited.  Foster said: 'We dealt with a million passport applications last month alone. To put that into context, we usually deal with seven million in a whole year. 'I would point out that where people have compelling and compassionate circumstances such as a funeral, applications can be expedited and it has now been for some time we have been advising to allow for up to 10 weeks for an application to be processed, and last year sent 4.7 million texts reminding people whose passports have expired to renew them.' Brits are being urged to check the validity of their passports and its expiry date. Under post Brexit rules, passports also need to not be older than 10 years. Previously, Brits who renewed early would get a rebate on their documents. So if they did it six months early, they would have this time added on to the expiry date of the new passport.  Now, with EU regulations calling for at least three months remaining on passports, it might be time to check your expiry date.",

The world's richest person completed the $44bn deal with a promise to reduce censorship on the platform. The prolific Twitter user describes himself as a 'free speech absolutist' - raising fears it could become a platform for hate speech. Asked for Boris Johnson's reaction to the takeover, the prime minister's official spokesman said: 'I think regardless of ownership, all social media platforms must be responsible. 'And that includes protecting their users from harm on their sites. 'Obviously, it is too early to say what if any changes will be made to how Twitter operates. 'It remains an important tool. It's used by world leaders and we will continue to work with them to make sure it continues to improve.'  Some human rights groups have raised concerns that a lack of moderation could lead to a rise in hate speech. Others are calling for accounts suspended by the company - such as former US president Donald Trump - to be allowed back. Asked if the prime minister would like to see Trump return to the site, he replied: 'That's not a question I've asked him. I think that's a matter for Twitter.' Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX boss, has pledged to boost free speech on the platform so it can fulfil its potential as the world's 'digital town square'. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey welcomed the takeover of his company but some staff have reacted with horror. Andy Burrows, the head of child safety online policy at children's charity the NSPCC said urgent clarity was needed over what approach a Musk-led Twitter would take to tackling online abuse. 'There's a huge difference in outcomes between a platform that tackles online sexual abuse versus meeting basic legal requirements,' he wrote in a tweet. US senator Elizabeth Warren, described the deal as 'dangerous for democracy', adding: 'Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain.' However, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a human rights activist and founder of the AHA Foundation, which works to liberate women and girls from cultural practices that violate their human rights, welcomed Musk's purchase. 'Elon Musk now owns Twitter. It is a great day for Free Speech,' she tweeted. 'Let's celebrate'. ",
    "a168d1f6cd0122518659dedd127e51b742f10aed426020000527ab21": "Business leaders have asked the prime minister to make this year's extra bank holiday permanent. And after the last two years, we think we deserve some celebrations.  This year, Brits will enjoy a four-day weekend in June to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. The usual late May bank holiday has been moved to Thursday June 2 and an additional bank holiday has been added on Friday June 3.  Now, campaigners have argued that a permanent extra bank holiday would provide an economic boost after Covid, as well as a boost in moral.  The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), UK Hospitality and several other well-known brands have written an open later stating that a 'thank holiday' would honour the monarch's long service, as well as people's efforts to support their communities, especially during the pandemic.  Those involved include the bosses of Siemens, Iceland and Punch Pubs and the chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale, as well as investor and entrepreneur Deborah Meaden, who is leading the campaign. TUC as well as the Royal Voluntary Service also support the campaign.  The signatories said in an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak that making the bank holiday permanent would 'provide a moment every year for individuals and communities to come together, to thank those who have contributed in ways big and small to making our country a better place to live'. Research from audit firm PwC commissioned for the campaign found that government figures have previously overestimated the potential cost of a new bank holiday by 64%. The consultancy found that the cost would roughly sit at about PS831m. More research found that social positives may have been missed out and that sectors such as retail and hospitality which were affected badly during the pandemic would benefit from the extra bank holiday. Additionally, findings highlighted that any knock-on costs would be decrease if the new bank holiday is on a Friday, due to how people's working hours tend to fall in a typical week.  Currently, England and Wales have eight bank holidays annually whilst countries in the European Union have an average of 11.  Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said that the hospitality sector would be 'ready to embrace this important tribute', but opening hours may be limited during a new bank holiday and businesses might need to find additional staffing cover. An extra day off? We're all for it.  ",

The former EastEnders actor - who recently appeared on The Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up 2 Cancer - said she appreciated that comments she made in April 2021 were 'hurtful'. Oberman had accused anthropologist and Middle East specialist Dr Philip Proudfoot - who is a research fellow at the Institute for Development Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex and founder of the Northern Independence Party - of using an online tool to block Jewish people from interacting with him.   In a now-deleted post, she wrote: 'So a man called @PhilipProudfoot of @FreeNorthNow has a Jew blocklist. I've been out of the Twitter politics loop for a few months but is this Party continuation Corbyn? Seems like it. And will it end up the same way? Seems like it. Good luck all.' In a statement shared on Twitter after the settlement was reached, Oberman wrote: 'On April 4 2021 I tweeted that Dr Philip Proudfoot 'has a Jew blocklist'. 'The following day Dr Proudfoot explained that this was wrong and that he had used 'a tool to mass block an account I followed that was involved in targeted trolling, which also blocks followers'. He has since assured me that this was an account which he believed was trolling and harassing him and he had not deliberately blocked Jewish accounts. 'I accept that Dr Proudfoot had at no time had a Jew blocklist and apologise for stating otherwise. I made a mistake and appreciate that my comments were hurtful. I have therefore deleted my tweet, agreed to pay substantial damages and legal costs.' Dr Proudfoot launched a libel claim against Oberman, claiming her allegation caused serious harm to his reputation, particularly given his status as a prominent academic, according to his solicitors.   He said in a statement: 'When I founded the Northern Independence Party, I expected public scrutiny. Harmful defamation, however, is unacceptable. 'Outside of my political life I am a humanitarian researcher. I've seen the horrors of war in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. It is for this reason I am a supporter of the struggle for human rights in Palestine. And it is for this reason I am appalled and disgusted by antisemitism, and all forms of prejudice. 'But it is harmful to allow the fear of false accusations to prevent us from speaking out against apartheid in Israel. Speaking out against injustice is also a fundamental political right. 'We must defend our rights, defend Palestinians, and never allow defamation to scare away solidarity.' His lawyer, Zillur Rahman, of Rahman Lowe solicitors, said: 'I am delighted for Philip, it really is a resounding victory. 'Antisemitism is a serious problem in our society and it is unfortunate that some people, like Philip, who show solidarity with the Palestinians in their struggle for freedom from Israel's oppression, have been falsely accused of antisemitism, which can have a chilling effect on free speech against injustices and human rights violations.'",

Helen shared the news on her Instagram story on Monday night, stating she was 'very sad' to confirm her split from the professional rugby league star. 'Very sad to say that Richie and I are no longer a couple,' she wrote. 'He has left the family home. We will be doing our best to co-parent our small children.' The message was also followed by two broken-heart emojis. Helen - best known for presenting Blue Peter between 2008 and 2013 as well as Countryfile - tied the knot with Richie in 2013.

The Oscar winner is hitting back at the response to her turn as the former FLOTUS in the anthology series, which follows the parallel lives of three women who made their mark on the White House: Obama, Betty Ford (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Eleanor Roosevelt (Gillian Anderson). Since the show's premiere earlier this month, viewers have mocked Davis' performance as unnecessarily exaggerated, with many expressing confusion about her decision to conspicuously purse her lips in certain scenes. Speaking with the BBC in an interview published Monday, the actor addressed the backlash for the first time, saying it's 'incredibly hurtful when people say negative things about your work.' 'Critics absolutely serve no purpose,' Davis told the BBC. 'And I'm not saying that to be nasty, either.' 'They always feel like they're telling you something that you don't know,' she went on. 'Somehow that you're living a life that you're surrounded by people who lie to you, and 'I'm going to be the person that leans in and tells you the truth.' So it gives them an opportunity to be cruel to you.'   Davis, however, doesn't appear to regret signing on for the role, saying that 'win or fail,' it's her 'job as a leader to make bold choices.' Said choices have previously paid off for Davis, who is one of the few performers and the only Black woman to have won an Oscar, Emmy and Tony award for acting, putting her within reach of the coveted EGOT status.  In contrast to Pfeiffer and Anderson, who have received notably better reviews for their work in the Showtime series, Davis said portraying a modern political figure is an 'almost impossible' challenge.  'Either you're doing too much or not enough,' she told the BBC, adding that she has not had 'any personal contact with Michelle Obama,' who has yet to comment on the series.  'The First Lady,' which wraps up its 10-episode season in June, is just one of many current and upcoming projects for Davis, who also recently released her memoir, 'Finding Me.'  She's next set to star in 'The Woman King,' a historical epic inspired by true events in the Dahomey kingdom, a former West African state in what is now Benin. 'How do you move on from the hurt, from failure?' Davis rhetorically asked the BBC. 'But you have to. Not everything is going to be an awards-worthy performance.'",
    "7605701f5e4e2b5c4b0e8432b8ed55fb946d8b5f72d88938ed2e260a": "With his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, Elon Musk has a new shiny thing. But unlike so many of Musk's moonshots (self-driving robotaxis, brain-machine interfaces, hyperloops, bulletproof cybertrucks, etc.), Twitter is already a mature product used daily by hundreds of millions of people. And with that comes a set of challenges, including at-times tedious day-to-day managerial tasks, that the world's richest person may not be eager to take on. The shiny new thing could quickly lose its luster. 'It's like the figurative 'the dog that caught the car' now that he owns Twitter,' William Klepper, an expert on corporate governance and a professor at Columbia Business School, told HuffPost. 'He'll have to provide the executive leadership needed to maintain and grow the company. He can't just hold it in his portfolio!' Inherent in that is respect for Twitter's existing company culture, which Klepper worried Musk may not take the time to understand, much less appreciate and work with. 'Twitter employees were already faced with a pending change,' Klepper said. 'Musk will now increase their disorientation. He would be best to learn how to lead constructive change of an existing company culture -- i.e. the way they do things around Twitter.' In addition to internal managerial concerns, the deal also makes Musk the high-profile face of controversial external choices, including intractable free speech problems at home and abroad. Those problems, and how he chooses to resolve them, present a reputational risk that could spread to other parts of his sprawling technology fiefdom. What happens, for instance, when Vietnam asks Twitter to silence government critics or face reduced access in the country? Will Musk acquiesce in exchange for a deal to open the market to Tesla? And will that taint the perception of Tesla back home? (This isn't a hypothetical: When faced with a highly similar request, Facebook gamely played along.) Those concerns are shared by Brianna Wu, the executive director of Rebellion PAC who's spent years advising Twitter's trust and safety team after being inundated with violent threats on the platform during 'Gamergate' in 2014, some of them so serious she and her husband left their house. Wu told HuffPost there's long been tension at Twitter between doing what's good for users and doing what's good for the company's finances. 'Which makes sense if you think about it, right? A death threat or a rape threat on Twitter is great for engagement,' Wu said. 'Everybody looks at it, everybody says something about it, you know, more eyeballs, more attention, more ads. But it's not good for the user experience.' With Musk at the helm, Wu said she fears profitability and engagement will be prioritized. At the same time, hard-fought, necessary protections for marginalized groups may not be enforced, leading to a resurgence in harassment. 'Musk leads without empathy,' Wu said, 'and the thought of a Twitter leading with even less empathy' than it already does 'is terrifying.' Evan Greer, director at Fight for the Future, a digital rights nonprofit, had a similar assessment. 'Content moderation decisions on platforms as consequential as Twitter should be made carefully and through a human rights framework,' Greer said in an emailed statement. 'But over the last several years, major social media platforms have increasingly made changes to their moderation practices based on news cycles and public relations. Now, there is a single human with the power to make changes to Twitter's speech policies. That's not a boon for free expression, it makes a mockery of it.'  'It was a problem when Twitter answered to Wall Street. But it's certainly not better if it's run by one billionaire.'",
    "6e4ca19674198f7cfdb1d3622e23818e6673ad9940d728af09eed9e0": "Ordering beer, wine or a cocktail while flying is a common move. For some, having an alcoholic beverage on the plane is a travel day essential to relax, take the edge off, celebrate a vacation or even to fall asleep on a long flight.  But is this really the best option? Alcohol can leave you groggy and dehydrated. When consumed in excess, it may lower inhibitions and lead to unruly behavior, which we saw a lot of when people reacted negatively to federal mask mandates. We reached out to some experts in medicine and nutrition, and asked if alcoholic beverages were a good idea while flying. Here's what we found out about how alcohol affects your body while you're up in the air. Is it a bad idea to order alcohol on a flight?  There's no easy answer to this question, experts say. Ordering a beer or wine while flying is a personal decision that might work for one person and not for the person sitting next to them. 'If a person is on edge due to flying in general -- and doesn't become more so with alcohol -- sometimes having a beverage might relax them or make the process feel a little bit more pleasant or more ordinary,' said Wendy Bazilian, a registered dietitian nutritionist. But while some may grab a drink as a celebratory kickoff for a long-awaited trip, others may experience side effects while drinking on a plane. You may not sleep well. It's tempting to order a drink in hopes that it will help you fall asleep and get some much-needed rest on an overnight flight. But this isn't necessarily the greatest idea, according to the experts we spoke to. 'Even though you think it relaxes you, your sleep will be disrupted and you likely will not get into REM sleep, the type of sleep that is restorative,' said Amy Shapiro, a registered dietitian at Real Nutrition. Drinking on a flight doesn't promote restorative sleep but can help some people fall asleep, Bazilian points out. 'If in moderation ... if she or he believes it helps a little to ease into sleep, then that can be fine.' You may become dehydrated. Alcohol is a diuretic, which means your body will increase its output of urine. If you don't drink additional water to make up for this fluid loss, you may quickly become dehydrated, Shapiro said. You may become intoxicated without even realizing. 'There is usually very little food available on most flights -- or it is not particularly appetizing -- and it would be easy to drink too much on a relatively empty stomach,' said Dr. Karen Jubanyik, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Yale University School of Medicine. It would be very easy to drink the same amount you drink at home, but without adequate food intake, this amount might be too much, she said.  There's also the fact that most people are pretty sedentary on a flight, rarely leaving their seat. When you do get up, you may find you're feeling the effects of alcohol more than expected. You could become disruptive. We all know that drinking alcohol can lower inhibitions. This could cause an individual to become loud and disrespectful to the flight crew and fellow passengers. People with lowered inhibitions may have a harder time staying calm when annoyed by small inconveniences and actions of people nearby, like a fully reclined seat back. 'If someone has lowered inhibitions, they may speak their mind or start a confrontation with another passenger over relatively small things, which can also land them in trouble,' Jubanyik said. You may have trouble moving around the plane. 'Progressive intoxication can lead to slurred speech, trouble with coordination and trouble walking,' Jubanyik said. 'Just walking to and using the bathroom or exiting the plane could be difficult.'  The good news? You can drink on a flight if you keep some recommendations in mind. Sipping a cocktail while commuting home from a work trip or while en route to a vacation doesn't carry a ton of benefits, but you can still enjoy a drink while flying if it's a behavior that works for you.  'It can be helpful in relaxing you or easing anxiety in the beginning, and since many people are anxious flyers, this can help,' Shapiro said, while also pointing out that drinking too much can lead to increased anxiety and have a boomerang effect, so it is important to know your limit. Sometimes you may just want to order a drink simply because you feel like having one (many of us regularly do so after work or on the weekends), and this is fine when done in moderation and with a few tips in mind. Don't drink on an empty stomach. If you plan to drink alcohol on a flight, pack some snacks and make sure to eat a meal before boarding if you know there won't be any in-flight food service.  'Eating food alongside alcohol can help maintain energy and steady blood sugar while your body processes the alcohol,' Bazilian said. Stay hydrated. The experts we spoke to recommend alternating each alcoholic drink with at least one or two glasses of water. 'This will help you to remain hydrated and to feel the negative effects less,' Shapiro said. Electrolyte drinks can also help, and if you have the chance, fill up your water bottle in the airport before takeoff. Water and other nonalcoholic drinks aren't always readily available throughout the flight, so sometimes it's just easier to carry your own.  Don't drink if you're going to be renting a car upon arrival. 'It is particularly a bad idea to drink alcohol if you will be renting a car and will need to drive upon arriving at your destination,' Jubanyik said. 'Even if not technically drunk, driving in an unfamiliar location will likely require additional attention and reaction time than one needs in their local environment.' Pace yourself. It's easy to drink quickly on a flight or to grab another drink simply as a way to pass time. Along with staying hydrated and taking a breather between drinks, Bazilian recommends paying close attention to how much alcohol you're consuming. 'One of those little alcohol bottles on a plane is typically 1.5 or 1.7 ounces, not a 1-ounce pour, and the mini-bottles of wine may be more than a 3-ounce pour. Just be aware that one drink [on a flight] may be more than you count as one when you're on the ground.'",

According to the ruling by a judge at the New York state Supreme Court, Trump must pay $10,000 per day for every day he continues to refuse to provide the documents. 'Today, justice prevailed,' Attorney General Letitia James tweeted. 'Our investigation into Donald Trump and the Trump Organization's financial dealings will continue undeterred because no one is above the law.' Earlier this month, James argued in court papers that Trump should be fined 'a sum sufficient to coerce his compliance' after he missed a March 31 court-imposed deadline to turn over the documents. Trump is currently appealing a February court ruling that said he must answer questions under oath in James' investigation, but the attorney general said the former president has not yet appealed a ruling establishing the deadline for him to provide documents. James said her investigation into Trump's business practices has revealed evidence that he allegedly misstated the value of assets like golf courses and skyscrapers on his financial statements for over a decade. Her office has said it is seeking Trump's testimony and documents while it works to determine whether the misstated values shown to lenders, taxing authorities and other business interests constituted fraud, and if so, who may be behind it.",

The Labour deputy leader said she was 'crestfallen' that a Tory MP made sexist comments about her to the Mail on Sunday. And she said it was a thinly-veiled attack on the fact she went to a comprehensive school and had a child when she was young. According to the paper, Conservative MPs claimed that Rayner had tried to put Boris Johnson 'off his stride' in the Commons by crossing and uncrossing her legs. They accused her of using the ploy from the Sharon Stone film Basic Instinct during their clashes at Prime Minister's Questions. In her first interview since the story broke, Rayner told ITV's Lorraine she felt 'crestfallen' by the piece and had to prepare her children for what they might read online.  She added: 'I felt really down about that, but I was overwhelmed by people's response because I just thought 'Is that what people expect and think about what I do?'' The senior Labour politician also said the story was 'condescending' to the prime minister, adding: 'It shows you what his MPs think about his behaviour, but it was also steeped in classism as well, about where I come from, how I grew up and that I must be thick and I must be stupid because I went to a comprehensive school. 'They talk about my background because I had a child when I was young, as if to say I'm promiscuous, that was the insinuation. Which I felt was quite offensive for people from my background.' She said a wider 'cultural shift' was needed, saying: 'We have got to teach our sons to be respectful of women and we've got to teach our women to be confident about themselves as well.' Rayner wore a trouser suit for her appearance on the ITV show because she did not want to be 'judged for what I wear'. As the row rumbled on for a third day, a government minister slammed the anonymous Tory MP responsible for briefing the story as 'despicable' and 'outrageous'.  Armed forces minister James Heappey said: 'I just find it outrageous that that colleague who sits within a party that has delivered two female prime ministers, that has two women in the great offices of state, that is surrounded by amazingly capable female MPs on the Conservative benches as well as over on the Labour benches too -- I just don't know what parliament they think they sit in.' Labour leader Keir Starmer has described the comments as 'rank sexism, rank misogyny'.  Johnson himself tweeted that he 'deplored' the misogyny that had been directed at her from one of his own MPs.  It is understood the prime minister also contacted Rayner privately by text message to reiterate what he said in his public tweet. ",

Christine Quinn and Amanza Smith were both absent from filming of the Selling Sunset reunion. Both agents were forced to miss the special, which is set to debut next month, after receiving positive Covid tests prior to shooting in LA over the weekend.  A rep for Christine told TMZ: 'Christine tested positive for Covid on Saturday and out of an abundance of caution, she did not attend the reunion.' Christine - who has cast doubt on her future on the hit Netflix series following the events of season five - also declined to appear virtually as she was not well enough, her spokesperson said.  However, Amanza joined host Tan France and co-stars including Chrishell Stause, Mary Fitzgerald and newcomer Chelsea Lazkani via video-link from her home.  Had Christine been able to attend, it certainly would have made for explosive viewing.   The final episode of the most recent series, which dropped last week, saw Christine face accusations she'd attempted to bribe a seller into working with her instead of colleague Emma Hernan - something Christine vehemently denied. After suggesting Emma was 'making up lies' about her, Christine had been due to meet with bosses Jason Oppenheim and Mary Fitzgerald, but failed to show up, leading to speculation she could be leaving the show. While Christine has not commented on her future with the Netflix series, she has announced her new venture that will seemingly put her in competition with The Oppenheim Group. Netflix had no comment to make when contacted by HuffPost UK. A representative for Christine Quinn was also approached for comment on her future at The Oppenheim Group and as part of the Selling Sunset cast. The Selling Sunset reunion is set to drop on Netflix on 5 May, with season five streaming now.  ",

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' diplomatic efforts to bring an end to Russian President Vladimir Putin's bloody war in Ukraine have been met with skepticism from Ukrainian officials. Guterres announced on Saturday he'll visit Russia and Ukraine this week to meet separately with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy questioned the purpose of Guterres' trip to Moscow. 'Why? To hand over signals from Russia? What should we look for?' Zelenskyy said following the U.N. leader's announcement, according to The Associated Press. Igor Zhovkva, deputy head of Zelenskyy's office, told NBC's 'Meet The Press' Sunday that the U.N. chief is 'not really' authorized to speak on behalf of Ukraine. 'This is not good idea to travel to Moscow,' Zhovkva said. 'We did not understand his intention to travel to Moscow and to talk to President Putin.' Zhokva expressed doubt that talks led by Guterres would be constructive. He also called on the U.N. to provide more humanitarian support for Ukraine. 'Any peace talks are good if they end with the result,' Zhokva said. Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine's prime minister, said that despite multiple efforts to engage Russia in meaningful peace talks, it appears the Kremlin is uninterested. 'I think the Russian Federation and Putin are not interested in this negotiation,' Shmyhal said. 'They are interested in other things. They are interested in genocide of Ukrainians.'  Last week, Guterres called for a four-day humanitarian cease-fire ahead of Orthodox Easter. 'Stop the bloodshed and destruction,' Guterres told reporters on Tuesday. 'Open a window for dialogue and peace. Keep faith with the meaning and the message of Easter.' Guterres' proposal went unheeded, as Russian missiles killed five people in Ukraine's Odessa over the weekend.  On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv. Blinken said that despite Russia's efforts to strip Ukraine of its independence, Ukraine is pulling through. 'We're seeing that when it comes to Russia's war aims, Russia is failing, Ukraine is succeeding,' Blinken said.  The U.S. officials also pledged an additional $300 million in foreign military financing and said the U.S. had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition. 'We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,' Austin said. President Joe Biden announced Monday he is nominating Bridget A. Brink, currently the U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.",
    "90f927792ac5ff560b89175007b93db82dd11125522dca6b5571f33b": "A government minister has slammed one of his own colleagues as 'despicable' and 'outrageous' for anonymously briefing a sexist slur about Labour's Angela Rayner in a Sunday newspaper. Armed forces minister James Heappey took aim at the anonymous Tory MP who suggested in a Mail on Sunday article that the deputy leader tries to distract Boris Johnson by crossing and uncrossing her legs during their exchanges in the Commons.  The source accused her of using the ploy from the film Basic Instinct during their clashes at Prime Minister's Questions -- a comparison that drew criticism from across the political divide.  The article prompted such a fierce backlash that Commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle has arranged a meeting with the editor of the Mail on Sunday and the chair of parliamentary reporters in Westminster to discuss the issue. Heappey said he was happy for Hoyle to take that action despite some concerns being raised about freedom of speech. 'I just can't believe that in 2022, we're in a place where the story that was written on Sunday was written,' he told Sky News. 'I just find it outrageous that that colleague who sits within a party that has delivered two female prime ministers, that has two women in the great offices of state, that is surrounded by amazingly capable female MPs on the Conservative benches as well as over on the Labour benches too -- I just don't know what parliament they think they sit in.' Heappey said female politicians 'on all sides of the house' have to 'put up with a level of sexism, misogyny every day that frankly, is unfair'. 'It is a disadvantage to them that I don't have to face as a male member of parliament or a male minister.  'I find the whole thing ridiculous, offensive and I'm sorry for Angela.' Asked about the impact that summoning a journalist could have on freedom of speech in politics, Heappey said he had 'no doubt' that Hoyle 'is protecting freedom of speech'. 'If the speaker is going to put a shot across the bows about the way that women in parliament are being reported, that's a good thing,' he said. 'I have no doubt he is protecting freedom of speech and he won't want to see that impinged but I do think that Westminster has got itself into a mess and it looks awful.' The article about Rayner -- which was also denounced for the tone it took towards her working class background -- was also strongly criticised by the prime minister, who said the person responsible for the briefing would suffer 'the terrors of the earth' if they are uncovered.  Speaking on a visit to Bury, Johnson said he thought the article was 'the most appalling load of sexist, misogynist tripe'. 'And I immediately got in touch with Angela, and we had a very friendly exchange.   'And, you know, if we ever find who was responsible for it, I don't know what we will do with them, but they will be the terrors of the earth.   'It's totally intolerable, that kind of thing.' ",

He also said it was 'not necessarily a problem' for them to use British weapons to do so. His incendiary comments came as Russia warned Nato countries to stop arming Ukraine, claiming it could lead to World War 3. Speaking to Times Radio, Heappey said that 'of course' the UK believed Ukrainian forces were entitled to attack Russia, given the fact that they were invaded by their neighbours two months ago. He said: 'The fact is that Ukraine was a sovereign country that was living peacefully within its owner borders and then another country decided to violate those borders and bring 130,000 troops across into their country. 'That started a war between Ukraine and Russia, and in war Ukraine needs to strike into its opponents depth to attack its logistics lines, its fuel supplies, its ammunition depots, and that's part of it.' He added that it is 'completely legitimate for Ukraine to be targeting in Russia's depth in order to disrupt the logistics that if they weren't disrupted would directly contribute to death and carnage on Ukrainian soil'. Heappey said it was 'not necessarily a problem' if British-donated weapons are used to hit sites on Russian soil after accepting that weapons now being supplied by allies to Ukraine have the range to be used over borders. 'There are lots of countries around the world that operate kit that they have imported from other countries, when those bits of kit are used we tend not to blame (the country) that manufactured it, you blame the country that fired it.'

During the launch of Piers Morgan Uncensored, Trump said he cannot reveal if he will run for office again, but added that 'a lot of people are going to be very happy'. The interview was part of the global launch schedule for TalkTV, the new venture from News UK, the publisher of The Times and The Sun. The new channel has begun airing on TV platforms across the world as well as online services such as Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and YouTube.   As part of the more than 70-minute interview, Piers asked the former US president if he will run again in 2024. 'For reasons of campaign finance and everything I'm not allowed to say but let me just say this, I think a lot of people are going to be very happy,' Trump replied. Also during the interview, the former president said he believes he is 'much more honest' than Piers. 'I don't think you're real. I think I'm a much more honest person in most ways,' he told the host. Piers appeared confused by the statement and asked: 'Why am I not real?' to which Trump replied: 'We're not gonna get into that, let's finish up the interview.' The wide-spanning interview explored topics from Russia's invasion of Ukraine to the 2020 American presidential election where Trump lost out to current US president Joe Biden. The second part of the interview will see Trump discuss the royal family, including him calling for the Queen to strip the Duke and Duchess of Sussex of their titles. Viewers also saw the former president walk out of the interview, a moment which was previously revealed in a 30-second teaser clip. Trump later released a statement claiming Piers 'attempted to unlawfully and deceptively edit his long and tedious interview with me' before the presenter urged the public to 'watch the interview - it will all be there'.   At the beginning of the talk show, Piers also delivered an opening monologue where he stated his show will be a 'no cancel zone'. He said: 'My mission statement for this show is very simple - I'm going to cancel cancel culture. 'I'll defeat this insidious, joyless societal scourge with those most effective of democracy-preserving weapons - common sense and truth.' Comedian Ricky Gervais also made a surprise appearance at the beginning as he offered the TV presenter a 'good luck' message. In a video, the comedian said: 'The producers of Piers Morgan's new show contacted me and asked me if I'd like to be a guest. I said 'Definitely not'. 'They said would you mind doing a quick video wishing him luck? I said, 'Do I have to mean it?' They said 'No'. I said 'Good luck'.' Piers famously stormed off ITV's Good Morning Britain last year and then subsequently left the show, after saying he did not believe claims made by Meghan during her and Harry's explosive Oprah Winfrey interview.   The fledgling news channel launched on Monday evening at 7pm with an hour-long evening bulletin segment, titled The News Desk, hosted by The Sun's former political editor Tom Newton Dunn. The show explored the daily news stories from across the world including the sexist allegations made toward Labour's Angela Rayner and the premiere of Downton Abbey. It also featured an interview with the mother and brother of British man Aiden Aslin who was captured while fighting with Ukrainian armed forces against Russia and an interview with the former personal assistant of Prince Andrew. Piers' segment was followed by a panel debate show The Talk, hosted by Sharon Osbourne. The show will see five famous faces with different backgrounds and views who will debate current affairs issues.",
    "379155c7a9c2d5cf8cd2afb744a99dbba637ca8c22be27d73dfb25c1": "Labour have accused the Tories of breaking strict pre-election rules by preparing to announce a crackdown on terrorism in prison. Justice secretary Dominic Raab is on Wednesday expected to unveil the government's response to a report by Jonathan Hall QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. According to The Times, Raab will announce that existing laws are to be strengthened to make it easier for convicted terrorists to be separated from the rest of the prison population. He is also expected to introduce tougher measures to allow acts of terror inside prison to be punished more severely. But Labour say the announcement has been timed to 'deflect attention' from the partygate scandal. Shadow justice secretary Steve Reed has written to Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, to ask whether rules banning major government announcements in the run-up to elections have been broken. Voters across the country will go to the polls for the local elections on May 5. The letter, seen by HuffPost UK, says: 'The issuing of fixed penalty notices to the prime minister, the chancellor and other officials has shone a light on the government's record on crime and an announcement such as this one could be perceived as an attempt to deflect attention away from these issues one week away from crucial local elections.  'Please will you confirm what consideration was given regarding the timing of this announcement, in line with guidance provided to all civil servants, including special advisers, and what specific advice was offered?' Reed said: 'This soft-on-crime Conservative government is trying to deflect from its own criminality.  'Bungling Dominic Raab has been sat on this crucial report for six months, yet it's only now, when the prime minister is mired in the partygate scandal and the Tory-made cost of living crisis, that his department issues its response to rampant radicalisation in prisons.  'The lord chancellor needs to tell the victims of terror offenders why it has taken him so long to take radicalisation in jails seriously.' A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'All announcements are made in accordance with government guidance.'",
    "829edd576c2b556a727929bf2fce5e4d5107c449c408129b6fa55a0e": "As parents, we want to raise good kids -- ones who are curious, confident, empathetic, resilient and respectful.  What we say to (or in front of) our children, the way we say it and the behavior we model help shape the people they'll become.  We asked experts to share some of the most important phrases we can teach our kids from a young age. Many of them are simple yet make a 'surprisingly big impact on children's abilities to thrive,' said educational psychologist Michele Borba, author of 'Thrivers: The Surprising Reasons Why Some Kids Struggle and Others Shine.'  1. 'There's no such thing as a stupid question.'  Little kids love asking questions -- sometimes nonstop from the moment they open their eyes in the morning to the time their head hits the pillow at night. All that curiosity is great, but it can also be exhausting for parents and caregivers.  'Sometimes we inadvertently deflect our children's curiosity because it can be overwhelming,' psychotherapist Mercedes Samudio, author of 'Shame-Proof Parenting,' told HuffPost. 'But teaching our children that there is nothing wrong with being curious and even teaching them how to seek out answers from others can be a helpful trait to cultivate in children from a young age.'  Encouraging their inquisitiveness and helping them feel confident enough to speak up when they're unsure about something will serve them well for years to come.  2. 'I got this!'  We want our kids to adopt a 'growth mindset,' a term coined by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, which describes the belief that talent can be developed with hard work, determination and help from others. Those with a fixed mindset, however, believe their intelligence and skills are innate and therefore unlikely to be improved upon.  'When kids (or adults) are in a fixed mindset, difficulty makes them feel inadequate -- their fixed ability feels deficient -- and their confidence becomes shaky,' Dweck told Stanford News. 'But when they are in a growth mindset, difficulty is a natural part of learning, so they are more likely to take it in stride and find new strategies that work better.'  Borba recommends encouraging your child to use phrases like 'I got this' or 'I can do this' to bolster their belief in themselves when challenges arise.  'Our children must develop growth mindsets -- a sense of personal efficacy or agency -- especially in today's uncertain world,' she said. 'Resilient children are tenacious -- they don't stop! And they don't wait to be rescued.' 3. 'Hi, my name is X. What's yours?'  Between schools being closed and many activities and events being canceled, the coronavirus pandemic limited kids' opportunities to socialize with their peers. Now that things are opening up again, we can encourage kids to get back out there and introduce themselves to new people and, hey, maybe even make a new friend. 'Two years of physical distancing has caused a lot of children to be socially anxious,' she said. 'They haven't exercised their social skills -- and they're easy to learn if we model them.' 4. 'It's OK to make mistakes. Just be honest about it.'  Making mistakes is an inevitable part of life. When we teach our kids this, we send a message that messing up is only human. It's how we handle those blunders that matters.  'Honesty is a trait many parents want to cultivate in their children, and the best way to do that is to make sure that it's OK to make mistakes in your family,' Samudio said. 'From a young age, we can teach children that the best way to develop honesty is to be supported through mistakes -- which moves children away from lying to get out of trouble, because mistakes don't bring punitive responses.'  5. 'Thank you.'  Gratitude is a learned behavior. As parents, it's our duty to help instill in our children the importance of being thankful for what we have -- and expressing it. Research has shown that practicing gratitude is strongly and consistently linked with greater happiness, as well as better health and relationships.  Saying thank you often increases gratitude -- 'a known and simple happiness booster,' Borba said.  You might model this to your child by expressing to them how grateful you are for their thoughtful or helpful acts, said Amy McCready, founder of Positive Parenting Solutions.  'Be specific about how they made a difference for you: 'Thank you for playing with the dog while I had my conference call. I really appreciate how you kept him occupied so I could concentrate on the meeting.'' she previously told HuffPost. 'Being the recipient of gratitude will encourage your kids to want to pass it on.' Let them also see you share your appreciation for others in your day-to-day life.  'From the cashier at the grocery store, to the dry cleaner to their teachers,' said McCready. 'Your kids are watching and listening.' 6. 'It'll be OK.' Helping our kids learn to stay optimistic through difficult times can put them in a better position to weather life's challenges.  Language like 'It'll be OK,' 'I'll get through it' and 'Things will get better' can be powerful in achieving this.  'Let's teach kids simple statements to keep hope alive and pessimism down,' Borba said.  According to Aha! Parenting, 'Research shows that optimists, who believe they can achieve success, are in fact more able to do so. They are less likely to get depressed, get fewer illnesses, have longer relationships, and live longer.'  Teach your child that they have the power to perceive setbacks any way they choose. When they're catastrophizing, remind them that many problems are temporary and often within their power to fix -- or at least improve.

So far we've heard from an avid runner, a baker, and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. For the fourth and final part in the series, we speak to Sagal Ibrahim, an Instagram influencer from London. The full-time content creator and mum of two incorporates her faith into her social media, often sharing religious tips and guidance on her channels. Sagal also endorses modest fashion in her posts and has amassed an impressive 197,000 followers online. Let's see how Sagal's fast has been going. Hi Sagal, tell us about your Ramadan routine 'So a typical day in a Ramadan for us usually starts like this - we wake up for Suhoor (a pre-dawn meal), which in my case usually is a glass of milk but others however do have a full or perhaps a light meal. After that the call to prayer is announced, I then pray Fajr (around 4.20am) and usually do not go back to sleep as it's so close to the time I would have usually woken up anyway. 'My children usually wake up about hour after that and I get one ready for school - making pack lunch and getting the uniform ready to wear. I get them both ready and we take my eldest to school. I usually then run errands and check off my to-do list with my little one with me.' 'We sometimes go for a walk or the playground. I then come back home just in time for Duhr prayer (usually, I'll work my day around my prayers so I can always be present fully and pray on time).'  How do you break up your day - do you have any rituals? 'After prayers, I get lunch ready for my little one and usually tidy up the house, go through my emails and shoot content for Instagram if I have any partnerships to work on with brands. 'I usually try to take it easy on the content creation during Ramadan as it is a special month for us Muslims. My little one and I then do an activity: for example, yesterday we made doughnuts. We then pray Asr which is another compulsory prayer. After that, we get the kids ready for bed and start cooking for Iftar. We then usually go to the mosque to pray Taraweeh (the long nightly prayer), but since having children, I tend to pray at home every evening.' What are you having for Iftar? 'Today we had Somali soup with salad and garlic naan bread, and for dessert we made cookie dough which we'll have with ice-cream later in the evening.' What do you crave the most while fasting? 'The one thing I probably crave the most during Ramadan has to be coffee, I rely on it so heavily everyday so being without coffee is definitely number one. 'The hardest part of fasting I think is definitely not having the same time I had pre-kids, when I was able to be really present, read the Quran and learn new things regarding my religion.' How does Instagram play a role in your Ramadan routine? 'During Ramadan I usually share more religious things with my Instagram community, cutting back on other content creating to be more present. However, if I do have collaborations to work on with brands, I set aside an hour or two to shoot this during my daily routine.' We hope you've enjoyed the series looking into the lives of Muslims and how they spend Ramadan. See you next year.",

    "1d0375314646c186ccda0e6ccb4b8dce583b7535791f79011ce209ca": "Twitter's board of directors announced that it agreed to sell the company to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, climaxing the world's richest person's quest to acquire his favorite social media platform and take it private. 'Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,' Musk said in a press release. He plans to add in new features, change algorithms and get rid of spam bots on the social media platform. Musk and Twitter's board were close to a deal after a meeting on Sunday, according to The Wall Street Journal. Musk, who already owned about 9% of Twitter's shares, said he had secured $46.5 billion to finalize the purchase. The reported agreement follows Musk's April 14 offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share, or about $44 billion, to take the company private. 'My offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder,' Musk said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. 'Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.' Before the deal, Twitter's shares had been trading well below Musk's offer price, suggesting investors had little confidence an agreement would be reached. At a TED event in Vancouver later the day Musk made his offer, the billionaire acknowledged uncertainty he'd pull off a deal, but said he was pursuing Twitter because he believes 'it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech.' Musk's interest aroused unease within the company. The day after Musk's offer, Twitter's board rejected it and said it would adopt a 'poison pill' anti-takeover defense. This 'does not prevent the Board from engaging with parties or accepting an acquisition proposal if the Board believes that it is in the best interests of Twitter and its shareholders,' the company added in a statement. Musk in the past has stirred trouble for himself on Twitter. In 2018, he tweeted that he had enough money to take Tesla private, but a court later ruled his claim was false and misleading. At the Vancouver TED event, Musk revisited the controversy. 'I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully. Those bastards,' Musk said of regulators, according to Reuters.  Following Musk's 2018 tweets, Tesla stockholders asked U.S. District Judge Edward Chen to stop the CEO's 'public campaign to present a contradictory and false narrative.'   The SEC charged Musk with securities fraud over those tweets. Musk settled for $40 million, half of it paid by Tesla. As part of the settlement, Musk agreed to step down as Tesla chair for three years and promised he'd allow the company to preview statements about the company.  This is a developing story.

    "f43c71e35b3d946826096b73a650a15112f76addf32ced13e5a3cacb": "On Sunday, French voters handed Emmanuel Macron a second term as president in an election in which he comfortably defeated far-right leader Marine Le Pen. But despite Macron's achievement - he is only the third president since the 1958 founding of modern France to win twice at the ballot box - there were mixed emotions. There was relief that Le Pen's National Rally, a movement long known for anti-Semitism, Nazi nostalgia and anti-immigrant bigotry, was held off, but also concern that having topped 40% of the vote, her brand of anti-foreigner, anti-system politics is increasingly popular in France. What happened? France's presidential election is held in two rounds. In the first round two weeks ago, 12 official candidates were whittled down to two - the centrist Macron and extremist Le Pen. It meant a replay of the 2017 election that Macron won comfortably (66% to 34%). Having had an image makeover and softened her tone, Le Pen was closing the gap on her rival compared to four years ago, according to the polls, leading some to fear she may actually win. Those fears subsided as polling day loomed, and Macron won with 58.5% of the vote to Le Pen's 41.5% - a handy margin but closer than when they first faced off. Why it's important?   Macron became the first French president in 20 years to win a second term. The last incumbent re-elected was Jacques Chirac, who trounced Le Pen's father in 2002. In doing so, France escaped a political, social and economic earthquake, and providing stability to the European Union as the continent grapples with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Le Pen's fiercely nationalist far-right domestic agenda included ending a number of welfare benefits for foreigners, stopping family reunification, giving preference to the French for jobs and social housing, banning the hijab in public spaces and kicking unemployed foreigners out of France. She also pledged to dilute French ties with the EU, Nato and Germany, moves that would have shaken Europe's security architecture as the continent deals with its worst conflict since the Second World War. Le Pen also spoke against EU sanctions on Russian energy supplies and faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin. Acknowledging that 'numerous' voters cast ballots for him simply to keep out Le Pen, Macron pledged to reunite the country that is 'filled with so many doubts, so many divisions' and work to assuage the anger of French voters that fed Le Pen's campaign.  A chorus of European leaders hailed Macron's victory, since France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is supplying weapons to Ukraine. Why are people still concerned? Macron's 17-point margin over the far-right challenger is significant, but commentators have interpreted the victory in a number of different ways. On the one hand, Macron has failed to ease the frustration fuelling Le Pen's politics, a goal that he set himself at the outset of his presidency. 'I will do everything in the five years to come so there is no more reason to vote for the extremes,' he said. Le Pen's support is an unprecedented result for the far-right. Surpassing 40% of the vote elevates Le Pen into the mainstream: since Charles de Gaulle beat Francois Mitterrand by 55% to 45% in 1965, all defeated finalists lost 40-something to 50-something. Le Pen called her result 'a shining victory', saying that 'in this defeat, I can't help but feel a form of hope'. But some critics have pointed to the dangers of over-interpreting a Le Pen 'victory', especially given the unique circumstances arguably working in her favour.  While Macron went into the vote as the firm favourite, he faced a fractured, anxious and tired electorate. The election was set against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic, which battered Macron's first term, as well as months of violent protests against his economic policies. In celebrating victory, Macron acknowledged a debt to voters who helped get him over the line, 'not to support the ideas I hold, but to block those of the extreme right'. 'I want to thank them and tell them that I am aware that their vote obliges me for the years to come,' he said. 'I am the custodian of their sense of duty, of their attachment to the Republic.'",

Musk, the richest man in the world, already owns Tesla, an electric car company, and rocket manufacturer SpaceX, which plans to go to Mars. He's also an enthusiast for cryptocurrency, known for championing bitcoin and dogecoin. The entrepreneur identifies himself a 'free speech absolutist', so his offer to buy the social media platform for $43 billion (PS33.8 billion) has sent alarm bells ringing as people fear the volatile website might get even more divisive with his takeover. As of January this year, the platform has an audience reach of 76.9 million users all around the world. Musk bought a 9.2% stake in Twitter earlier this month and then briefly entertained the idea of joining its board, but he changed his mind days later for unspecified reasons. The billionaire has been especially critical of Twitter over recent months even though he owes part of his celebrity status to the platform as he has more than 80 million followers. Musk has previously said that he does not believe the platform is living up to the principles of free speech, a message also pushed by former US president Donald Trump who was banned from Twitter last year. Trump is just one of several names, often on the far-right, who has been suspended for breaching Twitter's content rules around violence, hate or harmful misinformation. Controversially, Musk has already indicated that he might prefer time-out bans rather than permanent suspensions for people who break Twitter's rules. In his offer letter, the billionaire explained: 'I think free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy.' However, he added: 'Since making my investment I now realise the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form.' Musk also said if his 'best and final offer' was not accepted he would 'reconsider my position as a shareholder'. Reports from Reuters and the Wall Street Journal suggest Twitter is close to accepting Musk's offer - which works out to $54.20 (PS42.56) per share in cash - and the entrepreneur could even take the reins as soon as Monday afternoon. Here's how a few of Twitter's users reacted. Naturally, people had a lot of questions... There were calls for a mass return to Tumblr... Then there were the inevitable sceptics who dismissed the idea anyone would leave Twitter... Some users vowed to stay on so they could fight disinformation... Others seemed completely downbeat at the thought of the takeover... But some people felt the exact opposite... And then there was plenty of speculation about just what Musk might do with the platform...",

Defence secretary Ben Wallace said Moscow had also thousands of armoured vehicles, tanks, helicopters and fighter jets in the conflict. The shocking death toll is further evidence of how badly the war is going for Vladimir Putin and of the fierce resistance being put up by the Ukrainian forces. In a statement to MPs, Wallace said: 'It is our assessment that approximately 15,000 Russian personnel have been killed during their offensive. 'Alongside the death toll are the equipment losses and in total a number of sources suggest that to date over 2,000 armoured vehicles have been destroyed or captured. 'This includes at least 530 tanks, 530 armoured personnel carriers and 560 infantry fighting vehicles. 'Russia has also lost over 60 helicopters and fighter jets. 'The offensive that was supposed to take a maximum of a week has now taken weeks.' The Ministry of Defence this morning claimed Vladimir Putin was hiding the true scale of troop losses from the Russian people.  Officials said Russia had proposed that compensation payments for the families of dead soldiers would be overseen by 'military rather than civilian officials'.   The MoD added: 'This likely reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia's losses from the domestic population.' Wallace said Russia has so far 'failed in nearly every one of its objectives', adding: 'In recognition of this failure the Russian high command has regrouped, reinforced and changed focus to securing Donetsk and Luhansk oblast.' He added: 'At the start of this conflict Russia had committed over 120 battalion tactical groups, approximately 65 per cent of its entire ground combat strength. 'As of now we assess around over 25 per cent of these have been rendered not combat effective. 'Ukraine is an inspiration to us all. Their brave people have never stopped fighting for their lands. They have endured indiscriminate bombardment, war crimes and overwhelming military aggression but they have stood firm, galvanised the international community and beaten back the army of Russia in the north and the north east. 'We anticipate this next phase of the invasion will be an attempt by Russia to occupy further the Donbas and connect via Mariupol the Crimea so it's urgent that we in the international community ensure Ukraine gets the aid and weapons it so much needs.'

The prime minister said the smear, which was reported in the Mail on Sunday and based on briefing by an unnamed Tory MP, was 'the most appalling load of sexist, misogynist tripe'. Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, has received widespread support following the article's publication at the weekend. The newspaper branded it a 'Basic Instinct ploy' by Rayner to put Johnson 'off his stride'. In response, she tweeted: 'Boris Johnson's cheerleaders have resorted to spreading desperate, perverted smears in their doomed attempts to save his skin.' Speaking on a visit to Bury, Johnson said: 'I have to say I thought it was the most appalling load of sexist, misogynist tripe. 'And I immediately got in touch with Angela, and we had a very friendly exchange. 'And, you know, if we ever find who was responsible for it, I don't know what we will do with them, but they will be the terrors of the earth. 'It's totally intolerable, that kind of thing.' Earlier, Labour leader Keir Starmer described the claims as 'rank misogyny'. He told ITV's This Morning: 'You had an Angela on just the other week -- she's a fantastic woman, formidable woman, brilliant politician. 'I spoke to her yesterday morning just to see how she was, and she was just really disgusted that all of her political attributes were put aside for this ridiculous, offensive story, and Angela shouldn't have to put up with that.'",

Jamal, who helped launch the careers of Stormzy, Dave, Ed Sheeran and Jessie J through his SB.TV music platform, died in February at the age of 31. The Loose Women star says she is 'taking each day as it comes' following Jamal's sudden passing and revealed she was by his side when he died. Speaking to her fellow Loose Women panellist Coleen Nolan at her home in Cheshire, Brenda also spoke of her determination to keep Jamal's legacy alive. 'I'm doing okay,' Brenda began. 'The way I'm looking at it - I'm taking each day as it comes. 'The one thing that I do want to say is I was with him and his sister was with us, we were all at home. It was sudden and it was unexpected and he went into cardiac arrest. Then he passed with me holding his hand, so I get a little bit of comfort from knowing I was with him.' Brenda added, 'As much as that is comfort, at the same time, it's a vision that I'm never going to forget. When I wake up every morning - all of his photos are still obviously in the house - and I look at him and say, 'Good morning, baby' and 'Good night, baby'. And I think doing that is what's keeping me going.  'He always had this lovely, bright smile, just used to light up. He had this funny laugh. I feel his presence constantly and I know I've always been somebody who has faith and who believes in that and that has been a massive comfort to me.' Speaking about Jamal's funeral, which Brenda called a 'homegoing', Brenda said: 'When we laid him to rest, it was really beautiful. We looked up into the sky and there was a J - the clouds had formed a J. A friend took a picture of it.' Brenda also revealed she's set up the Jamal Edwards Self Belief Trust in Jamal's memory.  'It's been set up with two main things in mind,' Brenda explained.  'Jamal was all about empowering young people. We want to set up an academy for 16-21 year olds, giving them an internship if you like, within an organisation over a period of a year, where they learn everything from the ground up. And then we're also looking to set up a homeless sanctuary.' Brenda said of Jamal's legacy, 'He said, 'We all die, the goal is not to live forever but to create something that will.' And I believe he has created something that will and I'm determined to make sure that it will. That's my goal.' Brenda - who returns to Loose Women on Tuesday - also praised her colleagues for their support. 'It was funny, everybody's like, 'What can I do?' I had Judi and Charlene wanting to bring food round. I had food coming from all angles. 'It has been great having the ladies there and that's something which has been a big part of my life and the kids' lives that I need to return... I've missed everyone. I thank you for supporting and being there at the end of the phone for me.' Loose Women airs weekdays at 12pm on ITV.",

Christine Quinn has hinted she has left The Oppenheim Group after Selling Sunset's explosive season five cliffhanger.  The realtor has announced the launch of her own real estate business with comments of being her 'own boss', following the events of the most recent series of the Netflix reality show.  The final episode of the most recent series saw Christine face accusations she'd attempted to bribe a seller into working with her instead of colleague Emma Hernan - something Christine vehemently denied.  After suggesting Emma was 'making up lies' about her, Christine had been due to meet with bosses Jason Oppenheim and Mary Fitzgerald but failed to show up, leaving fans to believe she could be leaving the show.  While Christine has not commented on her future with the Netflix series, she has announced her new venture that will seemingly put her in competition with Jason's company.  Announcing her start-up with husband Christian Richard, Real Open, Christine wrote on Instagram: 'Why work for someone else when you can be your own CEO? 'It took over a year of hard work and tenacity to create this platform and patent-pending technology to revolutionise the housing market. 'My Boss Bitch manifesto is don't STOP until you are the Boss of your own life. YOU and only you control your storyline. It was a moon shot, and now it's a reality. Crypto is the new global financial system. Why ride the wave, when you can help create it.' According to an accompanying interview with Forbes, Christine and Christian are hoping to disrupt the housing market by using cryptocurrency in their company. Netflix had no comment to make when contacted by HuffPost UK. A representative for Christine Quinn has also been approached for comment on her future at The Oppenheim Group and as part of the Selling Sunset cast. However, it has been confirmed the show's stars are set to come together for a special reunion episode, which will drop on the streaming service on 6 May.  Prior to series five arriving on Netflix on Friday, Christine threw some shade at the show when she commented on what she called 'fake storylines'.  She tweeted: '30 minutes till the launch of #SellingSunset enjoy the new season and all of its 5,000 fake storylines!' However, it remains unclear as to what plots in particular Christine may have been referring to.  Selling Sunset season five is streaming on Netflix now. ",

But as it doesn't fall on a set date - Muslims follow the lunar calendar so Eid depends on the sighting of the moon - it can be difficult to book the time off.  Without Eid being a public holiday in the UK, Muslims are either forced to take the celebration as annual leave or simply work through it.  But people are raising the question online again:why is Eid not recognised as a holiday, for those who celebrate it? Especially now there is an increasing focus in the workplace on diversity and inclusion. After all, thanks to public holidays, we get time off for Easter and Christmas in the UK, despite most people not identifying as religious. You might wonder about the logistics of it all, but some companies like Monzo seem to have got the right idea. The bank offers its employees the chance to opt out of regular public holidays such as Christmas, Easter etc and reallocate their holiday to another time such as Eid or Diwali.  So isn't it time others follow suit? People on Twitter are wondering the same thing. Thankfully, Eid-Al-Fitr this year falls on either a Sunday or the May Bank Holiday meaning Muslims in the UK will get the day off regardless. But the same can't be said for Eid-Al-Adha, the second Eid of the year that Muslims celebrate, or Eid in subsequent years. Plus, Eid is a three-day celebration that usually gets reduced to one when Muslims have to return to school and work. Even if it weren't made a national a public holiday, employees could take a leaf out of Monzo's book and give staff the option of swapping their holiday days. Just something to think about.",
    "0df06bc0bb380e62db99eef9ac49e9b76f5f2c51cc06f7686f928f33": "A Labour split has erupted after Lisa Nandy told Keir Starmer to stop focusing on partygate and instead tell voters how they would tackle the cost of living crisis. The shadow local government secretary confronted the Labour leader at last Thursday's shadow cabinet meeting. She said Labour should be doing more to capitalise on voter anger at soaring inflation and rising bills ahead of the local elections on May 5. Nandy said there was a danger that voters would think 'we're all as bad as each other' if Labour continued to focus on Boris Johnson's woes over lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street. She said Labour risked looking 'out of touch' at a time when families across the country are struggling to make ends meet. One shadow cabinet source told HuffPost UK: 'She pissed everyone off because we've hardly seen her in the local election campaign.' Another insider said: 'There was a bit of confusion in the room as the shadow cabinet, the party and Keir have dedicated the entire election campaign to cost of living. 'But we can't just ignore partygate when the PM literally has to come to the House to explain himself on it.' But one shadow cabinet member said: 'Lisa's not alone on this. There was strong agreement in the room to focus on the cost of living.' Nandy, the MP for Wigan, was one of the candidates Starmer defeated to win the Labour leadership two years ago. He appointed her shadow foreign secretary in his first frontbench line-up, but moved her to the local government brief in a reshuffle last November. Ironically, last week's row came on the same day that MPs agreed to refer Boris Johnson to the privileges committee over claims he misled parliament by insisting lockdown rules were followed in Downing Street at all times. The Metropolitan Police have issued more than 50 fines over illegal gatherings in Number 10 and Whitehall, including to Johnson, his wife Carrie and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. The scandal has seen the prime minister's personal ratings plummet and helped Labour establish a consistent lead in the opinion polls. A source close to Nandy said: 'It was less of a criticism of the partygate strategy, more a warning for the future. 'Lisa doesn't think that partygate is irrelevant at all, but the cost of living matters as well and we mustn't lose sight of that.' ",

It emerged last week that he had been going round his department putting letters on empty desks which said: 'Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon. Wish every good wish.' Culture secretary Nadine Dorries has reportedly described the tactic as 'Dickensian'. 'Why are we measuring bodies behind desks? Why aren't we measuring productivity?' she said. Union leaders have also hit out at Rees-Mogg, with Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA representing senior civil servants, describing it as 'vindictive'. But the under-fire cabinet minister has been supported by the prime minister. The PM's spokesman said: 'What the minister is seeking to achieve is to do everything possible to get the civil service to return to the pre-pandemic level, that is supported by the Cabinet Secretary and also the PM.'

After leaving the show, the 69-year-old underwent months of ketamine therapy, with the class B drug carefully administered by nurses to induce dissociative anaesthesia, sedation, and amnesia. 'If you're a person that stuffs things [down]... 'I'm fine, I'm fine', this drug relaxes you,' she told The Times. 'You're not out completely. You can hear, you can talk, but you're so relaxed, and you can't bullshit on it. It's a truth drug.' Following her departure from The Talk, Sharon says she immediately started receiving chilling death threats. 'They were saying they were going to come in the night, cut my throat, cut Ozzy's throat, cut my dogs' throats,' she told the newspaper. It resulted in her hiring round-the-clock security.

The Mail on Sunday reported that some unnamed Conservative MPs claimed that Rayner had tried to put Boris Johnson 'off his stride' in the Commons by crossing and uncrossing her legs. They accused her of using the ploy from the Sharon Stone film Basic Instinct during their clashes at Prime Minister's Questions. Asked about the story on ITV's This Morning, Starmer said: 'Well, I saw the Angela Rayner story as everybody did, and its rank sexism, rank misogyny.

'I spoke to her yesterday morning just to see how she was, and she was just really disgusted that all of her political attributes were put aside for this ridiculous, offensive story, and Angela shouldn't have to put up with that.' The article was condemned across the political divide, with Conservative chair of the women and equalities committee Caroline Nokes calling it a 'dirty little story' that should make the Tory MPs 'hang their heads in shame'. Johnson himself tweeted that he 'deplored' the misogyny that had been directed at her from one of his own MPs. It is understood the prime minister also contacted Rayner privately by text message to reiterate what he said in his public tweet. It came as the Sunday Times reported that three Cabinet ministers and two Shadow Cabinet ministers are facing allegations of sexual misconduct. Starmer said the independent investigation should be allowed to 'take its course' but was in no doubt that Westminster was 'sexist' and 'misogynistic' and that 'whole culture of the place needs to change'. Following the publication of the Mail on Sunday article, Rayner hit back with a statement in which she said would 'not be letting their vile lies deter me'. She added: 'Their attempts to harass and intimidate me will fail.'   Starmer - who has had a fractious relationship with Rayner in the past - admitted that his party had failed to produce a female Labour prime minister. But he said if Labour won the next election, Rayner would be a Labour deputy prime minister. 'I'd love to see her as deputy prime minister -- she'll be absolutely brilliant,' he said.  ",

Ever since I started work, I have tried to go without a schedule. 'It was always like, 'If you've got a good idea and you believe in it, just try and make it work'.' Simon was recently forced to take a break from his work commitments after breaking his back in a bike accident, undergoing six hours of surgery which included having a metal rod inserted. He later claimed he was 'lucky to survive', admitting he deliberately withheld the severity of his condition from the public, claiming it was 'a lot worse than people thought'.  'I didn't talk about it too much at the time,' he told OK! magazine. 'I kept a lot back. It was a lot worse than people thought. I had a lot of long-term nerve damage as well. 'It's been a long haul but I'm almost healed and I'm being very careful about what I do. But at least now I can actually play football with [eight-year-old son] Eric.'  Having now almost recovered completely, Simon is now back in action in the latest series of Britain's Got Talent, which returned to our screens earlier this month.",

The Ministry of Defence said Russia had recently made 'minor advances' in some areas but was yet to achieve a 'significant breakthrough'. Officials said Russia had proposed that compensation payments for the families of dead soldiers would be overseen by 'military rather than civilian officials'. The MoD added: 'This likely reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia's losses from the domestic population.' The latest intelligence assessment was revealed in a statement by the MoD. The MoD added: 'Russia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbas. Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough. 'Russia's decision to besiege rather than attack Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant means many Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed. Ukraine's defence of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness.' It comes as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia was failing in all of its war aims in Ukraine, after he made a short visit to the country. Blinken said Russia continued to try to brutalise parts of Ukraine but Ukrainians were standing strong. After they failed to capture Kyiv, Russian forces shifted their focus to occupying the Donbas region in the east where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war.  In the south, Russian troops have been bombarding a Mariupol steel plant where an estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering along with 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. ",

Or maybe you heard a popping sound during your latest round of squats and thought, 'Oh, that's new.'  Knee pain is a common condition that afflicts millions of us every day. The issue can be caused by a number of things including slips and falls, sports-related injuries, exercising with improper form, and plain old aging. While many forms of knee pain are transient, discomfort in the knee area can sometimes linger. In fact, 1 in 4 Americans suffer from chronic knee pain. The good news? There are exercises, products and strategies you can use to help you live your best life when faced with knee pain.  Here are some expert-recommended tips for warding off the pain: Reduce the inflammation 'Pain is often the result of inflammation in an area,' said Dr. Natasha Trentacosta, a pediatric and adult sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute.  When knee pain strikes, she often tells her patients to try taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like aspirin, ibuprofen or naproxen. 'Follow the instructions on the product and check with your doctor to make sure there are no contra-indications,' she said. Trentacosta also recommends Voltaren gel, a topical NSAID, as it may be less abrasive on the stomach for sensitive patients.  'For acute, debilitating pain, a doctor may administer a corticosteroid injection into the knee joint to help decrease acute inflammation quickly, usually within days,' Trentacosta added. This provides quick relief but is not something that medical professionals like to use repeatedly in the same area within short periods of time, she said. Don't rest (at least not too much) Light exercise can actually help heal knees faster in many cases.  'Movement helps keep blood circulating, can increase flexibility and prevents muscles from stiffening up,' said Dr. Jacob Hascalovici, co-founder and chief medical officer at Clearing and a clinical assistant professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.  He added that it's safe for you to move with your physician's permission and that, in general, movement won't typically worsen most knee conditions.  'Try to take a long, slow walk, go swimming, do 30 minutes of yoga or perform some other kind of low-impact workout several times a week,' Hascalovici said.  Get some ice on it 'Cryotherapy or use of ice and cold to decrease swelling and ease pain has been used for many years to relieve ailments in the knee and body,' Trentacosta said.  She suggested applying ice for 15-20 minutes 3-4 times a day in the setting of an acute knee injury. 'This can help reduce pain and swelling in the joint, especially in the first 48-72 hours of an injury,' she explained. If the injury is recent, go beyond icing and follow PRICE, which stands for: protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation.  'Traditionally these methods are used for the first 72 hours after an injury,' said David Fields, owner of Reactivate Therapy, a physical therapy center in Oklahoma. 'Protection and rest so you don't irritate or reinjure. Ice to bring down the temperature. Compression to combat swelling. Elevation to decrease the blood pressure to the affected limb.'  This combination, he explained, works to reduce the natural inflammatory response that your body mounts to an injury.  Pad your knees A little extra padding can make everyday activities more comfortable. When attempting kneeling yoga postures or stretches that require you to kneel, place a yoga pad under your knee for extra support.  You can also use a knee pad in additional settings. 'Place the pad under your knees when kneeling on hard surfaces, like gardening or cleaning or repairs at home,' Fields said. 'And if you are moving around a lot, you may want to consider knee pads that stay on your knees.' (Such as these ultra light knee pads.) Get a pair of supportive shoes The shoes you wear can make a big difference in how your knees feel.  'Focusing on the base, aka your feet, will likely help align your knees and prevent overextension of ligaments and tendons and conditions like arthritis from becoming a problem,' said Dr. Ebonie Vincent, a foot and ankle surgeon based in California and star of TLC's 'My Feet Are Killing Me.' A 2021 study found that people who walked in shoes that were supportive experienced a reduction in knee pain. In another study, women who wore high heels experienced additional knee strain, putting them at higher risk of knee osteoarthritis. Look for a good pair of stable, supportive walking shoes like these expert-recommended ones from Vionic. If your shoes aren't comfortable, add an insole. Orthotics, like these from Dr. Scholl's, are a good starting point. 'Having a sturdy pair of inserts that support the arch as well can be an additive and even necessary support for some,' Vincent said.  Do some strength training 'Happy knees are dependent on the balance of all the muscles around them, above them and below them,' explained Joy Puleo, a certified pilates teacher and education program manager at Balanced Body.  To keep knees healthy, Puleo stressed the importance of balancing strength between the inner and outer thigh, maintaining strong and healthy quads and hamstrings, and working the deep muscles of the glutes. Puleo recommended the following exercises:  Inner thigh circles: Put one forearm on the ground and prop yourself onto one side, with your shoulder directly above your elbow. Bend your top leg so the knee points upward and the foot is flat on the ground. Keep your top hip aligned with the bottom one and the bottom leg straight. Lift your bottom leg up to meet your top knee. Lower and lift the bottom leg or make circles with the bottom leg. The inner thigh of the bottom leg, as well as your abs, should be doing most of the work. Do several leg lifts, then lift your bottom leg up and hold, before doing 10 circles in either direction. Repeat on the other side. Shoulder bridges with a ball: Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and a ball or towel in between them. Your heels must be directly below your knees. Squeeze the ball and raise your hips from the ground. Don't arch your back; lift by squeezing your bottom and legs at the back. Pull your navel up your spine as you raise your hips. Do 10 bridges in succession before holding at the top. Then squeeze your ball or towel using your inner thigh in a 10-pulse routine. Repeat three times. Clams: Lie flat on your side, bending your legs and placing one on top of the other. Raise your heels from the ground. Keeping your bottom leg stationary and stable, squeeze your upper thigh and gluteal muscles to open up the top leg, just like a clam. Position your knee so it is pointed skyward but without your top hip having to fall back. Your hips should also be stacked when doing this exercise. Do 10-20 reps per set, then repeat on the other side.  Wear a knee brace 'Modern custom knee braces are designed to absorb unequal force and distribute weight more evenly upon the knee,' said Dr. Matthew Crooks, a pain management physician in Scottsdale, Arizona.  When worn during activity, knee braces can reduce stress and pain and can help you to be more active in situations where knee pain has previously affected mobility. (Not sure where to start? This knee brace by Vive Health is a good beginning point.) Be mindful, however, that braces are not meant to be a long-term solution. 'They are a preventative measure against reinjury to allow you to heal,' Fields said.  They should also not be worn all of the time -- only when performing tasks that require knee support. 'If the problem persists, you need to seek the help of a professional,' Fields added. See an orthopedic doctor 'Most knee pain is self-limited, which means it will go away without medical intervention, especially in kids and young adults,' said Dr. Robert Blais, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon with Texas Orthopedics, Sports & Rehabilitation Associates. Seniors, on the other hand, are more prone to lingering knee pain. Blais recommended seeing a medical provider for pain that interferes with sleep, limits activity and/or requires daily use of medications to alleviate pain.  'Pain that lasts longer than two weeks should be evaluated,' he said. Pain after injury that does not get better with a few days of rest should also be of concern.",

Multi-millionaire Akshata Murty gave up the perk - which allowed her to avoid paying UK taxes on her international income - following a huge public backlash. She has since announced that she will pay UK taxes on all of her income, although she will retain her non-dom status. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said 'it simply isn't right that those at the top can benefit' while ordinary people are facing rises in their own tax bills. In a further sign of the political damage done to the chancellor, a new poll of grassroots Tories for the ConservativeHome website showed he is now the least popular member of the cabinet. Labour said that if they win the next election, those from abroad who choose to base themselves in the UK will pay tax to the Treasury on all of their income. Reeves said: 'As the Tories raise taxes on working people, it simply isn't right that those at the top can benefit from a outdated non-dom tax perks.  'With Labour, people who make the UK their home will contribute to this country by paying tax on their global income.  'The prime minister and chancellor have spent the last few weeks preoccupied with saving their own skins, and have done nothing to tackle the spiralling cost of living.  'Even worse, they've made it harder for working people to make ends meet by hiking national insurance.  'Labour is on your side. We will tax fairly, spend wisely and grow the economy.' Sunak - once heavily tipped to succeed Boris Johnson as prime minister has accused his political opponents of trying to 'smear' him by attacking his wife.  He told The Sun newspaper that Murty was entitled to use the so-called 'non-dom' arrangement as she is an Indian citizen and plans to move back to her home country to care for her parents. The fashion-designer daughter of a billionaire married the chancellor in 2009 before he became an MP.  She hasn't broken any rules. She's followed the letter of the law,' Sunak told the paper.  The chancellor said his partner 'pays full UK tax on every penny that she earns here in the same way that she pays full international tax on every penny that she earns internationally'.   ",

'I've had splinters on my feet, I'm physically exhausted, I've had breakdowns. All the detox time in the world doesn't change how burned out I am.' This is the experience of Anthony*, a tech worker, 34, from London. After being asked to work weekends, weeks of late shifts, only then to be swapped onto earlies without warning, Anthony's job has left him totally drained. So much so he's quit his job without securing another. 'I just can't take anymore of this.' Anthony isn't alone in this state of mind. By the end of 2021, burnout was affecting more than 79% of UK workers, according to research by the HR tech company Ceridian, with 35% of people reporting high or extreme levels. Nearly half (49%) of those surveyed in research cited an increased workload as a cause. The ongoing pandemic, post-Covid recovery, and the so-called Great Resignation, have left employers squeezing more out of their workers than ever before. And it's causing a physical and mental health crisis. Is there a chance of recovery? How long does it take to get over burnout? We've seen buzzwords like self-care, wellness weekends and digital detox become the norm, but they risk ignoring the broader picture - that short stints of respite or relaxation don't counteract the strenuous, back-breaking and brain-fogging nature of work under capitalism. So what can we do? The obvious solution - if the Great Resignation is anything to go by - is to leave workplaces, even professions, that are bad for our health. It's what Lana*, 26, a social services worker in New York City, had to do to get some relief from her burnout. 'I quit working in the most toxic field possible in which I was forced to travel all over the city to unsafe locations. I got no support while dealing with people in extreme suffering/people who are dying. So I decided to get out of the field,' she tells HuffPost.  'Now I do my job and come home. No travel, no dying, I don't stay late and I don't take work home with me. 'My burnout was affecting me and my clients. I had to take a good hard look at myself and give myself the freedom to breathe again.'  Lana says she appreciates not everyone can leave their job immediately, especially given how expensive the cost of living is right now. But if you are experiencing burnout, she says, it pays to make a change, rather than attempting simply to work through it. 'Finding new work definitely isn't the only way to get over burnout, but you have to know when it's time to take a break or reevaluate,' she says. 'I feel like we owe it to ourselves.'  And while you might not completely be able to get over this block, there are some things you can do to mitigate burnout.  Jo Davison, a business strategist who predominantly mentors female entrepreneurs, says she sees burnout among her clients all too often. Recognise when you're being pushed too much, she says. 'Acknowledge that burnout is a result of the body telling us to stop. But we choose to ignore it, and don't listen,' she tells HuffPost. 'Taking changes is important because going back into exactly the same situation will only ever delay the healing.' So how long can you expect to take to recover? Well, there is no right answer as the journey isn't so linear. 'Recovery from burnout is definitely affected by how long it has been going on and how the individual recognises they have it and how actively they want to overcome it. For some it may be 10-12 weeks, however for others it can take years.' 10 steps to dealing with burnout Davison says there are ways you can aid your own recovery, whether that ultimately means leaving a job - or not. Here are some of those steps: 1. Acknowledge that it exists 2. Track stress levels (use an app, journal)3. Identify the stressors and step away from these situations4. Seek professional help. This is a strength not a weakness5. Create a work life balance that includes time to have fun and rest6. Change jobs if it is really badly affecting your mental health7. Be kinder to yourself and keep a gratitude journal8. Own it and believe that you can change it9. Create a healthy sleep schedule and diet10. Set boundaries. While these are ways as individuals that we can ameliorate our conditions, remember that setting personal boundaries may not change the demands of your job wholesale.  This requires a company-wide push, or if you've got enough seniority in your role, a persistence in demands to change the wider work culture. Work should be a complementary part of our lives, not the thing that makes it unliveable. *Names have been changed and surnames omitted to offer anonymity.  Life-Work Balance questions the status quo of work culture, its mental and physical impacts, and radically reimagines how we can change it to work for us. ",

The former X Factor judge underwent the five-and-a-half hour procedure last year, saying she looked 'horrendous' at first.  In an interview with The Sunday Times, Sharon said: 'I had a full facelift done in October and I looked like one of those fucking mummies that they wrap [with bandages].  'It hurt like hell. You have no idea.' Describing the original result, Sharon continued: 'I'm telling you, it was horrendous. [To the surgeon] I'm, like, 'You've got to be fucking joking.' One eye was different to the other. I looked like a fucking Cyclops. I'm, like, 'All I need is a hunchback.'' Sharon said her husband Ozzy Osbourne had a similar reaction, saying: 'He said, 'I don't care how much it costs, we'll get it redone.'' However, she added that her face is 'settling now' and she's pleased with it. Sharon has been open about her cosmetic procedures in the past, undergoing numerous surgeries, including a previous facelift she had in 2019.  In a recent interview with the Daily Mail, Sharon admitted she'd 'probably' spent more than half a million pounds on surgery. She explained she only has procedures for herself, rather than because of any pressure on women in Hollywood, adding: 'Just look at pictures of me from 25 years ago. I was totally out of condition, 230lb in weight and a not very good-looking woman.  'Somebody you'd pass in the street. I was at a gig and there were these girls at the side of the stage and one of them said to me, 'Oh, are you Ozzy's mother?'",

A Killing Eve writer has revealed the show was not originally due to finish with its fourth season.  The hit BBC thriller came to a controversial end earlier this month, with fans and critics calling out the 'lazy' and 'unoriginal' ending.  However, Kayleigh Llewellyn has said that the show had been set to return for a fifth season, but the decision was made to end it with the fourth during the pre-filming stages.  Speaking to Metro, Kayleigh revealed: 'Well, when I was hired, it originally wasn't going to be the final season, there was going to be another one. 'That was a decision that was made during the process, so that was a big change.' Due to the pandemic, filming of the fourth season suffered a number of set backs. 'A job that would normally have been eight months became kind of two years,' Kayleigh added. 'The world kept changing, and filming constraints changed vastly, as well.' The show wrapped up with main characters Eve and Villanelle finally getting it together, before the deadly assassin was shot on the orders of Carolyn Martens and bled to death after jumping into the Thames with Eve. It was heavily criticised by fans and critics, who noted that the decision to kill a queer character played into the 'bury your gays' trope present in many works of fiction, whereby more queer characters - and in particular lesbian, bisexual female and transgender characters - die compared to their straight cisgender counterparts. Last week, Luke Jennings - who penned the Codename Villanelle novels on which Killing Eve was based - hit out at the ending in a piece for the Guardian.  He wrote: 'The season four ending was a bowing to convention. A punishing of Villanelle and Eve for the bloody, erotically impelled chaos they have caused. A truly subversive storyline would have defied the trope which sees same-sex lovers in TV dramas permitted only the most fleeting of relationships before one of them is killed off.  'How much more darkly satisfying, and true to Killing Eve's original spirit, for the couple to walk off into the sunset together? Spoiler alert, but that's how it seemed to me when writing the books.' ",

The prime minister and the culture secretary were both quick to tweet out against the Mail on Sunday report which claimed some Tory MPs thought Rayner was crossing and uncrossing her legs at PMQs in order to distract Johnson. They both wrote: 'As much as I disagree with Angela Rayner on almost every political issue I respect her as a parliamentarian and deplore the misogyny directed at her anonymously today.' Yet, technology minister Chris Philp said there was 'nothing surprising' about the PM and culture secretary tweeting out the exact same message. Sky News' Niall Paterson said this kind of message meant 'the Conservative Party's commitment to sorting this mess out didn't seem that strong', asking in disbelief: 'They share the same view to the word?' Philp replied: 'Nadine's my boss, and she feels very strongly about the place of women in politics and this sort of abuse is unacceptable. 'I'm sure she will have discussed it with the prime minister and they've reached the same view and they've used the same words.  There's nothing surprising that two colleagues in government have exactly the same view and have the same words.' Paterson hit back: 'There's nothing surprising about two human beings sitting down at the keyboard and tapping out the exact same sentence construction? 'Honestly, you're trying to maintain the culture secretary didn't copy and paste this, this wasn't something that was sent to her? ''These aren't her own words, they're clearly not her own words because they were said by the prime minister 15 minutes before.' The minister simply claimed that Dorries had 'expressed these sentiments countlessly times' to him, and deflected by saying: 'If they were saying different things, you'd be asking me about that wouldn't you?' Philp himself condemned the report, and said he was 'appalled'. 'I've never heard anyone say anything like that or even hint at it, and if I did I would be disgusted and appalled,' he continued. 'No-one should have to suffer that sort of misogynistic abuse which that sentiment amounts to.' He indicated that if the Tory whips were to find out which MPs had briefed the Mail on Sunday about Rayner, he imagined there would be some discipline. Paterson asked: 'Does this not demand an internal investigation by the whips, by the party?' 'I think they'll be looking at who said it, and as I said, I think everybody is appalled by the misogynistic sentiment,' Philp repeated. He also said politics in public life needs to be 'civil and respectful', dealing with the issues constituents are concerned about, rather than abuse.",

Last week Corbyn suggested military alliances like Nato could build up 'greater danger' in the world and should ultimately be disbanded. The former Labour leader was stripped of the whip in 2020 over his response to the equalities watchdog's report into anti-Semitism in the party. He was reinstated as a Labour member after a suspension, but Starmer has refused to readmit him to the parliamentary party. Corbyn's allies in the party have repeatedly demanded that their ally be allowed to sit as a Labour MP again so he can stand for the party at the next election. But asked on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme whether Corbyn could be restored as a Labour MP following the comments, said: 'It is very difficult to see how that situation can now be resolved. 'He lost the whip because of his response to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission in relation to anti-Semitism but I made it very clear, the first thing I said as party leader was that I was going to tear out anti-Semitism by its roots in our party. 'I've also made it clear that our position in the Labour Party is not to accept the false equivalence between Russian aggression and the acts of Nato.' Told that it sounded as if he was against Corbyn returning as a Labour MP, Starmer replied: 'I'm very clear on my positions on those two issues, very clear.' Corbyn, the MP for Islington North and a long-standing critic of Nato, told Times Radio last week that he did not blame Nato for Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine but questioned: 'Do military alliances bring peace?' He acknowledged the transatlantic alliance was not going to be scrapped immediately but added that people should 'look at the process that could happen at the end of the Ukraine war'. Corbyn has described the choice to remove the Labour whip from him as a 'totally unjustified decision'. Asked if he could start his new own political party, he said: 'I don't know what the future is going to bring.' Last week Boris Johnson accused Starmer of being 'a Corbynista in a smart Islington suit'. But Starmer responded: 'I think you'll find Mr Corbyn doesn't have the whip.'",

Last month, Jamie Wallis revealed he was raped and blackmailed, wants to transition to be a woman, and also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in a highly personal statement. The Tory MP for Bridgend was praised for his bravery after revealing that he was 'not OK', and for being open about having gender dysphoria. In an interview on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday, the 37-year-old politician offered advice to young people who were struggling with their gender identity. He said he 'wouldn't wait as long as I've waited', but there was 'nothing wrong with just taking some time and discovering yourself'. 'But when you know who you are, you are ready and you want to tell the world, there are people like myself who are waiting and we're welcoming, we're friendly and we're here to help and support' he added. Wallis, who said he still intends to use he/him pronouns until a later stage in his transition, also opened up about feeling alone as a child, coping with questions about his gender identity. He said: 'I came to the wrong conclusion, at the time I thought it was just me and that maybe there was some horrible mistake or something that had gone very wrong.' 'As I got older and I started to learn a little bit more about this issue and that moment when you realise it isn't just you, that moment isn't just a revelation, it is exciting and terrifying at the same time', he added. He explained how he had 'tried to become this person that I thought I should have been' but 'woke up one day and I realised actually I am no longer ashamed' in 2021. The MP, who previously disclosed he was raped by a man, said he 'felt very ashamed and empty inside' following the experience and suffered nightmares and flashbacks as a result. But he told Sky it was 'truly frightening' to discover the 'shocking' number of people who got in touch with him to talk about their similar experience. Wallis also touched on being targeted by a blackmailer who threatened to out him to the public unless he paid PS50,000, and the 'toxic' debate on transgender participation in competitive sport. The politician came out in a post online shortly after a gathering for Tory MPs at which the prime minister reportedly made a joke about trans issues.",

This morning's is the latest dose of gutter journalism. 'I stand accused of a 'ploy' to 'distract' the helpless PM - by being a woman, having legs and wearing clothes. I am conspiring to 'put him off his stride'. The rest I won't repeat - but you get the picture. 'Boris Johnson's cheerleaders have resorted to spreading desperate, perverted smears in their doomed attempts to save his skin. They know exactly what they are doing. The lies they are telling.' Johnson also distanced himself from the story. 'As much as I disagree with Angela Rayner on almost every political issue I respect her as a parliamentarian and deplore the misogyny directed at her anonymously today,' he said on Twitter. Rayner added: 'The potted biography is given - my comprehensive education, my experience as a care worker, my family, my class, my background. The implication is clear. 'But it is the PM who is dragging the Conservative Party into the sewer - and the anonymous Tory MPs doing his bidding are complicit. 'He and his cheerleaders clearly have a big problem with women in public life. They should be ashamed of themselves. 'I won't be letting their vile lies deter me. Their attempts to harass and intimidate me will fail. 'I've been open about how I've had to struggle to get where I am today. I'm proud of my background, I'm proud of who I am and where I'm from - but it's taken time. 'I hope this experience doesn't put off a single person like me, with a background like mine from aspiring to participate in public life. That would break my heart. 'We need more people in politics with backgrounds like mine - and fewer as a hobby to help their mates.' Oliver Dowden, the Conservative Party chairman, told Sky News on Sunday morning he believed the story was 'totally ludicrous'. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, branded the story 'disgusting' and 'misogynistic'",

The prime minister is under renewed pressure over the partygate scandal after he was forced to allow a fresh inquiry into whether he misled parliament.  A YouGov poll has suggested the majority of the public believe Johnson lied about Downing Street parties. One former cabinet minister told HuffPost UK: 'A lot of people feel trapped in a nightmare that doesn't end and they don't see how it can.' But Speaking to Sky News on Sunday morning, Oliver Dowden said he did not think a no confidence vote in Johnson by Tory MPs was inevitable. 'Talking to the prime minister, he's got plenty more fuel in the tank. He's got real energy and determination to continue to serve this country and deal with some of the big challenges we face,' he said. 'I think the uncertainty that would be caused by a change of leader would be dearly damaging to this country.' The Tory chairman added: 'I do think he will lead us into the next election.' Johnson's next test are the local elections on May 5, where a poor showing could be the trigger for more Conservative MPs to call for him to resign. The PM has been warned by a former Tory minister that his party will 'reap the whirlwind' of the lockdown parties saga at the ballot box as the threat of more police fines hangs over him. Steve Baker told The Daily Telegraph his constituents were expressing 'fury' at reports of lockdown breaches. The influential backbencher turned on the Johnson in the Commons during the week, telling MPs the PM should have realised the 'gig's up' after the Met concluded he had breached his own coronavirus rules. On Friday evening No 10 responded to ITV's report that new fine notices had started landing in the email inboxes of officials by saying the PM had not received a notice in relation to the gathering. Downing Street has stated it will still declare whether the prime minister receives further fines in the lead up to polling day. According to The Guardian, allies of former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and trade minister Penny Mordaunt had been making 'discrete preparations' for a leadership contest. Facing questions about the alleged parties during his final day in India on Friday, the PM suggested his administration had received a 'pretty good kick'.",

The dance group, which features people with different disabilities, jumped for joy and rolled around in the golden glitter after David pressed the buzzer which will see them go straight through to the competition's live semi-final. Ahead of their audition, a member of the troupe, who has autism, said: 'We have a barrier but we want to break them barriers and show the whole world that life is an opportunity for people with disabilities.' A memorable moment came when the Northampton group took to the stage, as one of the dancers held her hands over her face in excitement and disbelief at seeing judge Simon Cowell in the flesh.   Following their performance to You Can't Stop The Beat from musical Hairspray, Simon said: 'I didn't like it, I loved it. He added: 'I loved the fact that you were having such a great time, it was actually one of my favourite auditions, I am going to be honest with you.' The dance saw solo performances from some of the group members, who are aged between 14 and 24, and gymnastic moves which included cartwheels and the splits. During the act, presenter Declan Donnelly said: 'You can't help but smile all the way through it.'   Judge Alesha Dixon said the group's passion was 'pouring out' during the act while David said he 'absolutely loved it' before pressing his coveted golden buzzer. Saturday night's episode also saw impersonator Suzi Wild receive a standing ovation from all four judges after her impressions of the Queen, Lorraine Kelly and Janet Street-Porter had them in hysterics. The 34-year-old, who also imitated Kirstie Allsopp and Gemma Collins, said her motivation for auditioning was because she has not seen someone who looks like her doing impersonations before. A dangerous act came in the form of escapologist Andrew Basso, whose inspiration was magician Harry Houdini and his water torture cell act. Amanda joined him on stage, handcuffing both his hands together and restraining his ankles, before the 36-year-old was hung upside down in a locked cell of water and attempted to escape using just a paper clip.   The audience and judges began to panic after two minutes as the performer seemingly struggled to undo the lock, but after three minutes he escaped and the judges were wowed. Meanwhile Hammerhand, from Hamberg in Germany, attempted to break the Guinness World Record of 122 coconuts broken with a hand in one minute. The 62-year-old martial arts teacher managed to smash 60 coconuts in the time and was not put through to the next round of the competition. Mary P opened the show with a surprise rendition of the Black Eyed Peas My Humps which Amanda praised as keeping the Disney character Mary Poppins 'relevant'. The London Community Gospel Choir, who sang a compilation of The O'Jays Love Train and Anytime You Need A Friend by Mariah Carey, also impressed.   Amanada said the performance was like 'drinking 20 Beroccas', adding it was an 'injection of life, love and energy'.

    "c867618b2aa6ba04cb249571df41e936f6c4ae58fec500e4c3662136": "The urge to quit a relatively new job can be an uncomfortable feeling, but it is not uncommon. According to a 2018 survey from the recruiting service Jobvite, 30% of new employees leave their jobs within the first 90 days of getting hired. The top three reasons quitters gave were that the role did not meet expectations from the job interview process (43%), a one-time incident that made them want to leave (34%), and bad company culture (32%).  During the Great Resignation, more of us may be saying our farewells sooner. 'Talent has a little bit more of an upper hand,' and old-school rules of sticking it out at a hard job may no longer apply in certain cases, said Mary Abbajay, president of the leadership development consultancy Careerstone Group and author of 'Managing Up: How to Move Up, Win at Work, and Succeed with Any Type of Boss.'  But before you give notice and join the league of early quitters, consider why you want to leave so soon after starting. Sometimes it can take a few months to feel comfortable in a new role and with new colleagues. And if you're at the beginning of your career, it's helpful to know that first-job blues are typical. 'You want to make sure you are not leaving just because you don't like working, as you are getting used to the difference to being in school and being at work,' Abbajay said. If it is indeed the first-job blues, she recommends sticking it out for a year to gain experience you can talk about in future interviews. But you should also trust your gut if something feels off. 'We have to dispel this myth that we have to sit in agony if it's not working out,' said career coach Jasmine Escalera, who does not subscribe to the 'stick it out' mentality.  Here are three scenarios in which it is definitely not too soon to quit a job:  1. You find yourself in a toxic job.  Nothing drives people out quicker than a toxic work environment. According to a FlexJobs survey from February and March of more than 2,000 U.S. employees, 'toxic company culture' was the top reason people cited who felt they had to quit their jobs in the past six months.  This is for good reason. A difficult boss like a micromanager can be annoying to deal with, but they can be managed. A toxic boss, on the other hand, will corrode your soul and is an active threat to your health.  Abbajay noted that a difficult boss 'may be impulsive, they may be poor communicators. Their style of working just isn't aligned with your style of working. A toxic boss is a boss that is dehumanizing, a boss that is abusive, a boss that is screamer, a shouter... [With] a toxic boss, you are going to start to feel less than, you are going to be consumed with the stress of dealing with this person.' If you feel stuck with toxic bosses and colleagues, don't linger. 'Once you recognize the toxicity, or the organization's toxicity, you should think about getting out,' Abbajay said.  Escalera agreed with this assessment. Having escaped a toxic work environment in the past, she finds that toxic work cultures cause trauma and make it impossible for you to be confident and capable in your professional life.  'The longer you are there, the deeper those cuts are going to be, and the harder it is going to be to leave, because you start to change the perspective of how you think about yourself,' she said.  2. The job is a radical mismatch with what you were promised in interviews.  You shouldn't wait too long for circumstances to improve if the job you were sold by recruiters and hiring managers is radically different in reality. This likely means there'll be no learning opportunities ahead, no internal mobility and no alignment with your planned career future.  If you believe a mismatch in roles is fixable, talk to your manager and colleagues about what you feel you deserve and what you need to see change, Escalera advised. But don't put undue pressure on yourself to stay in a job that isn't suitable.  Escalera said she experienced a mismatch when a leadership and mentorship role she interviewed for at a hospital turned out to be different than what was discussed. She tried to talk with her supervisor to get her responsibilities more aligned with the expectations she had from the interview process but was basically told, ''This is what it is,'' she said. She left the job within five months and has no regrets: 'If I could've left in five days, I would have.'  3. You get a better offer that aligns with your goals.  If you get a dream job offer soon after you start a new job, you should reflect on whether the new opportunity is the better choice for your future career success, regardless of how short your current tenure is, Escalera said.  If the new opportunity is 'going to get you to that end goal quicker and faster, you have to do what's in best service to you,' she said.  Abbajay warned, however, that too many one-year-and-under stints on your resume can be a bad look to prospective employers. Your next potential employer may think, 'Why should I invest in you if you're not going to invest in me?' she said.  Still, there's a way to positively spin this in job interviews. When Escalera was asked in interviews about her short stint in the mismatched hospital job, she was candid about how the role was different than promised and didn't align with where she wanted to go. Her advice to job seekers is to be transparent about past mismatches, while also being clear that as a result of the experience, you now know that this new opportunity is the best role for you, she said.  If you are wrestling with guilt about bailing on a relatively new job for something better, that's normal. Escalera said she has experienced this guilt as a Latina who grew up in public housing and whose parents wanted safety and stability for her career. 'It puts a ceiling on what you believe is possible for you when you come from backgrounds like that. It makes you feel like, 'If I got this, then I should just settle in it, and I should just keep it... because this is better than where I came from, this is better than even what my parents have at the age of 60 years old, and I am 40,'' she said. 'You have to be internally very strong and internally have a purpose to move your career in the direction that you want, and you have to make decisions coming from that purpose, but that is really hard when there are really a lot of external voices.' In the end, you are in the driver's seat of your career -- not your new boss, or your new company, or your family. If you have a gut feeling that a job is not going to be good for your well-being or future, you should listen to that feeling, regardless of whether the warning comes in the first few months of the job.  Often, there are times 'when you knew something wasn't right, and instead of connecting with that feeling, you tried to push that feeling down,' Escalera said, noting that's a mode of thinking she has moved away from. 'What I try to do now is entertain the feeling.'",

The British actor played ageing rocker Billy Mack in the 2003 Christmas rom-com and there's one particular line that has followed him everywhere. Literally. In one of the film's most memorable scenes (watch below), Billy appears on a kid's TV show fronted by a youthful Ant and Dec when he addresses the young viewers at home with an important message. 'Hiya kids, here's an 'important' message from your uncle Bill,' he begins. 'Don't buy drugs. Become a pop star and they give you them for free.' In a new interview with GQ magazine, Bill says the scene and Billy's seriously dodgy advice has become so well known that it he still gets reminded of it regularly by complete strangers in the most unexpected places. 'I was once going through immigration from Canada to America in the middle of the night, like 4am, and there was no one in the immigration hall except me and there was this guy and I went forward,' Bill recalled. 'And as I was going forward he said 'hey, kids don't buy drugs...', this is the customs guy right... 'don't buy drugs, become a rockstar and people give you them for free. Am I right? Am I right?' I was like, drugs? No, I don't have any drugs. So it got me into America!' He added: 'When I die, if I get an obituary, it will say: 'Hey kids, don't buy drugs.

From the dark days of January and February, when his leadership was on the brink due to the allegations of lockdown rule-breaking in Downing Street, the prime minister had got back on track. The war in Ukraine provided him with the opportunity to focus on international affairs, and his response to the crisis has been widely-praised. Some MPs who had previously submitted letters of no confidence in his leadership withdrew them, insisting now would be the wrong time to change prime ministers.  Using the breathing space Ukraine had afforded him, Johnson attempted to get on the front foot by publishing an energy security strategy which, he claimed, would eventually help to tackle the cost of living crisis. Rishi Sunak's well-publicised troubles over his wife's non-dom tax status and the row over his decision to hang on to a US green card while being a government minister meant there was no obvious successor should the PM fall, further shoring up Johnson's position. But the Metropolitan Police's decision to fine Johnson - as well as his wife and Sunak - for attending a No. 10 birthday party for the prime minister in June 2020 - returned partygate to the front pages and raised fundamental questions about his judgment. Although he apologised, Johnson vowed to ride out the controversy, even though further fines are expected for other gatherings he attended. U-turn if you want to But this week's chaotic handling of Labour's attempt to hold a privileges committee inquiry into whether the PM misled parliament over partygate showed how precarious his position remains. Having initially tried to block it, Johnson was eventually forced to U-turn after it became clear that dozens of his own MPs - including some ministers - were refusing to support his position. 'I know one colleague who told the whips they were willing to be sacked rather than vote with the government,' revealed one backbencher. MPs eventually agreed that the privileges committee will hold an inquiry once the police investigations into partygate are over and after Sue Gray has published her full report into the affair, meaning it will dog Johnson for months to come. Nightmare on Downing Street With the opinion polls becoming increasingly grim for the Tories, their MPs realise that something needs to happen soon to change their fortunes. The only problem is they can't agree on what that should be. One former cabinet minister told HuffPost UK: 'A lot of people feel trapped in a nightmare that doesn't end and they don't see how it can.' Their dilemma is best summed up by Craig Whittaker, a former government whip whose patience with Johnson snapped a long time ago. On the BBC on Thursday, he said: 'I don't believe for one minute that Boris Johnson has taken responsibility for his actions, an apology doesn't constitute taking responsibility and that's why I've asked him to resign.' But while he wants Johnson out, Whittaker doesn't want a leadership contest either. Tobias Ellwood, another Johnson critic, implored his colleagues to wake up before it's too late. He said: 'We must stop drinking the Kool-Aid that's encouraging us to think this is all going to disappear and that we can all move on.' With his critics divided on how best to proceed, it's unsurprising that the PM still feels confident that he'll be in charge for a while yet. Rishi's Sunk He is helped by the fact that there is no obvious replacement for him since Rishi Sunak's spectacular fall from grace. 'Rishi's support has evaporated,' said one senior Conservative MP. 'I doubt he'll stand at the next election.' Others take the view that deposing Johnson at the height of the Ukraine crisis would be madness. One former Tory minister told HuffPost UK: 'Look, I like Boris. I was really upset about partygate, really upset. 'But I think with everything going on now in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis it would be absolutely insane to get rid of him. 'I also don't see what the alternative is. There isn't anyone. And why would we put government on hold for months? It is the last thing we need.' A kick in the ballots? The local elections in two weeks' time are another potential trigger point. Predictions of 800 Tory losses are no more than expectation management, to allow anything less than that can be presented as success. But party insiders are still bracing themselves for a bad night. The people who will ultimately decide whether Johnson makes it to the next general election as leader are Conservative MPs, who have it in their gift to boot him out of office if they think he is leading them to defeat at the next election. Ominously for the PM, Steve Baker - whose ability to organise Tory rebellions ultimately saw off David Cameron and Theresa May - this week withdrew his support, telling Johnson: 'The gig is up.' Meanwhile, Tory peer Lord Hayward - a highly-respected psephologist - described Johnson's situation as 'death by a thousand cuts'. But while a consensus seems to be forming among Tory backbenchers that the PM must go, they cannot agree on when it should happen, how it can be done and who should replace him. As one astute Tory backbencher observed: 'I think now it's something left field that'll do for him - but who knows when?' ",
    "500375d830f2a4545b8ac503a97fea0b46849f19d973b6dfd3aa77aa": "Rolling over. The first step. The first word. Parents often fixate on these classic developmental milestones, but doing so can lead to unhealthy comparisons and insecurity.  'Milestones are exciting, but also know that your child may not follow the 'expected' ages for specific actions,' said Christina Furnival, a psychotherapist who specializes in children's mental health. 'Each child is unique and special and wonderful, regardless of the standard milestones they reach and the age at which they reach them.' Of course, if you have serious concerns about your child's development, it's important to talk to your pediatrician. But if you simply find yourself feeling worried about their progress and your ability as a parent, remember that there are so many milestones worthy of celebration, including more nuanced and subtle ones. Below, Furnival and other experts share 21 interesting and insightful small milestones in childhood development. Showing visual attention 'Visual attention is a very important early developmental milestone that is more difficult to measure in a concrete way,' said Lauren C. Shuffrey, a developmental neuroscientist. 'At birth, infants already have the ability to visually distinguish different types of objects, such as human faces, and this skill continues to develop over time. Visual attention to social or nonsocial stimuli in the early life environment helps form the basis for more complex skills later in infancy, such as social communication and joint attention.' Kristene Geering, director of content at Parent Lab, noted that she looks for and delights in seeing a baby express joint attention -- another big step in their visual attention development.  'This might be a child looking at something, turning back to the parent, then looking back at the object,' she explained. 'Or it could be them pointing at something and checking to see if you're looking, too. A lot of parents don't realize what a big deal that is for both communication and cognitive development, but it's huge!' Dropping and knocking things over It may seem annoying when your little one drops their toy every time you hand it to them, but Rachel Robertson, vice president of education at Bright Horizons, said this is another big sign of growth.  'Toddlers are really great scientists,' she explained. 'They are exploring a lot of cause and effect: Like what happens when I drop my spoon once, twice, 10 times! How about if I dump this bucket of blocks? They are working on muscle control.' Amanda Gummer, a child psychologist and founder of The Good Play Guide, noted that babies dropping things is a step toward understanding 'that they can have an impact on their environment' -- thus making major strides in cognitive development. 'For example, splashing water, knocking over a pile of blocks, or pressing a button on a toy to set off lights and sound,' she added. 'Toddlers and preschoolers will then progress from seeing the world in a very concrete way, to being able to use symbolic and logical thinking.' Forming a strong attachment 'Has your infant around five months on become less comfortable with being passed around and a little more clingy?' said Noel McDermott, a psychotherapist. 'They are forming attachments in a healthy way to a primary carer. Their neurological frontal lobe development -- the brain development crucial for language, social, thinking, executive decision making -- is happening.' He explained that this mechanism allows them to develop bonds with others throughout their lives. While this can manifest as separation anxiety and pose challenges, it's actually a milestone when your child shows a strong attachment to a parent or friend. 'Even when your preschooler cries at drop-off because they are so comfortable with you -- that's a milestone to note,' Furnival added. 'Also when they run into class without looking back.' Playing peekaboo  'Peekaboo is another milestone that, while parents certainly enjoy it, they don't often recognize as a sign of object permanence,' Geering said. Object permanence is the ability to understand that items or people still exist even when you can't see them. 'There are several stages for object permanence, and recognizing that this is a milestone ... can make a parent's day.' Smiling at and with you When your baby smiles at and with you, that's a powerful developmental milestone that fosters connection and communication. Pay attention to 'social smiles.' 'Smiling is a way to bond with your child,' said Dr. Ann-Louise Lockhart, a pediatric psychologist and parent coach. 'It also helps them with their self-concept -- understanding who they are in relation to others,' she added. 'It gives them reassurance that you love and care about them. It's also a way for people to connect since so much of our communication is nonverbal and subtle.' Eventually they will recognize themselves in the mirror and smile then as well, indicating an understanding of self. Engaging in imaginative play Playtime is an important part of child development, and the toddler years are when things start to evolve quickly.  'Your kid will start to play by themselves, and in their play space, objects can change and morph,' McDermott said. 'Blocks can transform from one thing to another. A pencil may become a rocket. A toy car may become a submarine. Your kid is developing their literacy. This ability to imaginatively transform and maintain transformation in a creative internal narrative is the cognitive skill needed for reading.' Kelly Oriard, a family therapist and co-founder of Slumberkins, an educational brand focused on emotional learning, said parents can get a glimpse into their child's inner world by joining them during playtime. She noted that imaginative play fosters language development, relational interactions, problem-solving skills, and self-esteem. 'This magical milestone is such a fun one,' Oriard said. 'Your child will begin to imagine and create their own little worlds for themselves and their toys. Through this milestone, children can better figure out their place in the world and their roles within their different systems. Another benefit of imaginative play is that kids can also explore their emotional identification and expression.'  Taking turns 'From ages 1-3 years, milestones can include sharing toys with friends or siblings and learning to take turns during play,' said Sanam Hafeez, a neuropsychologist. This milestone manifests earlier than many parents expect, so they might not recognize its importance.  'Of course, we want our kids to take turns on the playground, but when your toddler rolls the ball back and forth with you -- that's also turn-taking!' Geering said. 'And it builds not just the social-emotional skills we want our kids to have, it also helps in communication, that back-and-forth part of speech.' Saying 'no' Hearing 'no' from your toddler can get frustrating, but Robertson explained that it is not necessarily a bad thing.  'For toddlers, saying 'no!' means they are discovering their independence and exercising some control,' she said. 'They are figuring out they have preferences and opinions, but don't have a lot of words or methods of expressing them. It is worth noting when they start to be able to express their feelings like that, it is a sign of identity development. 'Me do it' or 'I no want broccoli' means they understand they are an individual who can express thoughts and have some autonomy.' Matching objects 'It's important to understand that one skill usually builds on another,' Geering said. 'For example, while parents may think of reading as a milestone, it's actually several milestones building on one another. One very early reading skill is being able to match two objects. A later stage would be matching that object to a photo, and then to an illustration.' The smaller steps that build up to reading are important little milestones on their own. Parents can see that their child is making progress when they learn to recognize those incremental skills. 'If you see rows of patterned scribbles or shapes that sort of resemble letters, that means they are beginning to understand communication and that markings are symbols that represent words and ideas,' Robertson added.  Asking 'why' questions 'When you child is about 3, they start to ask 'why' questions,' said John and Kyle Hattie, co-authors of '10 Steps to Develop Great Learners.' 'This is a big deal as they are trying to understand the weird world they have come into. Things are happening that they want to begin to understand, see how their thinking about the world is true or not, and become genuinely curious.'  The authors noted that it's important for parents to help their children find answers to their queries because during this time is when their child is developing a theory of the world around them. 'Children who do not get answers to the many 'why' questions begin to fall behind their peers, become less trusting in the world and people around them, and later in school struggle to make meaning,' they said.  Recognizing the urge to use the bathroom 'While parents often think of potty training as one thing, it's made up of a lot of steps along the way,' Geering said. 'It starts with the brain being able to even recognize the urge to go.' During this time, kids are also 'learning to coordinate their brains and bodies,' she said, for example, when they are figuring out how to pull their pants down and back up. Starting daycare 'Entering daycare is a big milestone for toddlers and parents,' Lockhart said. 'It introduces the concept of separation from primary caregivers, socializing and connecting with other adults and peers, independent play, gross and fine motor skills, and executive functioning skills, like problem-solving.' She acknowledged separating from your little one can be nerve-wracking for many parents, but it's a powerful and important developmental task. Engaging in parallel play 'A stage of social development that's easy to miss is when babies are playing next to other babies, but not together,' Gummer said. 'They may be doing something completely different, watching the other child, or perhaps copying what the other infant is doing. This is known as parallel play and it will progress into playing with others as they get older.' She emphasized that parallel play is a big first step toward collaborative play and making their first friend.  Experiencing humor 'The first laugh or even the first time your child understands humor and cracks a real joke -- should be noted and observed with greater frequency,' Oriard said.  She explained that a child's displays of humor are joyful moments but also important social-emotional milestones to celebrate. Take note when you see your kid 'get' a joke and laugh, relish in making other people laugh, or laugh at themselves when they do something silly. Showing empathy 'Social-emotional milestones are being able to recognize emotions in themselves and others, and demonstrate compassion,' Robertson said. 'Maybe they share something with a friend who is sad or offer you a hug without prompting. This shows you that they're developing perspective and empathy.' Acknowledge the first time your children show concern when someone is sad or hurt. Foster this empathy by helping them identify big feelings in themselves and others. 'Empathy is such a powerful skill, and throughout your child's life, it can help create more robust and healthier relationships with others, including peers,' Oriard said.  Developing motor skills 'As a parent, point out those small skills your kids have now that they didn't have a few months ago,' advised Deborah Farmer Kris, a parent educator. 'Zipping up their jacket, putting on their socks, using a spoon, sorting their toys. Walking, talking, reading and writing aren't events -- they are a cumulative processes.' Furnival added that fine motor milestones may look like anything from using scissors to holding a pencil a certain way, while gross motor milestones can be going up the stairs one foot at a time or throwing a ball. Seeing things as right and wrong 'Another important social-emotional milestone occurs around the ages of 4-5,' Oriard said. 'At this stage, children begin to understand right and wrong and begin to conceptualize things from a moral viewpoint.' Beginning to see things as right and wrong indicates that your child's worldview is broadening, so they are better understanding how their actions can affect others. 'While moral development doesn't happen all at once and is fine-tuned through many years, at this age, we begin to see it burgeoning into our children's day-to-day interactions.' Demonstrating emotional self-regulation In addition to recognizing and expressing emotions, showing signs of emotional self-regulation is a significant milestone. 'When a child tries -- maybe doesn't always succeed -- but tries to calm their own emotions, that is a really important sign of a critical life skill of self-regulation, being able to control emotions and actions,' Robertson said. 'This is paramount in a classroom or a boardroom.' Practicing complex and flexible thinking An underappreciated sign of development is when a child demonstrates an ability to hold more than one thing in their mind at once and think flexibly. Robertson believes that this shows budding executive function control.  'Executive function is the most sophisticated set of brain functions and develops into a person's 20s,' she explained. 'It's often compared to the CEO of the mind and includes working memory, self-control, and flexible thinking. If a child can remember three-step directions, or plan ahead and follow through even when distracted, or play a game like Simon Says, they are developing those very important abilities.' Gummer pointed to another important step in the development of logical thinking and cognitive reasoning skills.  'Until around age 7, a child will believe that a tall, thin cup holds more liquid than a short, wide cup,' she said. 'This is known as conservation. It can support a child's math skills and along with other types of logic, can help children to problem solve in many different scenarios.' Finding success at school Parents often fixate on report cards as the most significant marker of a child's development in an academic setting. But Joanne Frederick Washington, a licensed mental health counselor, believes there's much more to it than grades.  'Other milestones that may not get recognized are kids waking up on their own every morning to go to school, their achievement of going into the next grade level, no days absent in a school year, not getting suspended, or having detention in a school year,' she said.  Overcoming a challenge Going to school or participating in sports and other activities gives kids the opportunity to overcome a challenge or persevere after making a mistake.  'When they make a mistake, the big deal is what then happens next,' John and Kyle Hattie noted. 'It's learning that errors and failure are the learner's best friends, and they are opportunities to learn.' Challenges force kids to develop interpersonal skills, resilience, self-awareness, creativity and confidence. 'Going from frustration to satisfaction is the goal,' said Susan G. Groner, author and founder of 'The Parenting Mentor.' 'We need to allow our kids to experience the frustration in order for them to figure it out and problem solve and then feel the satisfaction.' She emphasized enjoying your time with your child and supporting them as they grow. 'Observe the little things. Maybe we call them 'inch stones,' she said. 'Hitting markers should be fun, rather than stressful!'  This is part of a HuffPost Parents series called Enjoy The Ride. Read more here.",
    "4a36f0107232dce0f27afc5e4f6bb1ff6dbb5d36fc9a4c00267a2f95": "As the war enters its third month, it's clear the Russian invasion has not gone entirely to plan - but that doesn't mean victory for the Ukrainian resistance is on the horizon. Further horrors have been unfolding in the east of Ukraine recently, particularly in the besieged city of Mariupol, suggesting Russia has no intention of giving up or going quietly. The Ukrainian president has laid out exactly the kind of help the country needs from the west to prevent the war from spilling over into the rest of Europe. So will Nato step up, or will it continue holding back? The war took a turn for the worse this week Russia has focused its efforts on the east of Ukraine, while its attacks become more merciless. Newly released satellite images suggest haunting mass graves have been dug near the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, which has been under siege for more than a month. The graves could hold as many as 9,000 bodies according to the local authorities. Around three-quarters of Mariupol's residents have already fled, and a shocking 20,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed. Despite all of this, Ukrainian forces allege they are still in control of the city - even as Russia declares its first substantial victory in the war. Russian president Vladimir Putin previously told the forces in the area they had to either surrender or die but he has since called off an attack on the final stronghold, a steel mill where around 2,000 Ukrainian fighters are reportedly hiding. Instead, he ordered such an unshakable blockade of the plant 'so that a fly can't get through', which gave the Kremlin a chance to declare a win without significant casualities. The city is a significant battleground in the war because it is the last hurdle in Moscow's bid to create a land bridge between its territories in the eastern Donbas region and the Crimean Peninsula. The Ministry of Defence has warned that Putin's decision to blockade the steel plant 'likely indicates a desire to contain Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol' so the Russian forces can be spread across the east of the country. Meanwhile, eastern Donbas still faces intense shelling by the Russians, even as its troops 'are still suffering from losses sustained earlier in the conflict'. Detective chief superintendent Dominic Murphy from the Met War Crimes police also told PA new agency that it had received approximately 50 referrals from people with UK links about the Russian invasion. As the war continues to escalate, he explains: 'What we're seeing is incredibly harrowing, beyond comprehension. 'In not far off 17 years in counterterrorism, (it is) some of the worst possible footage you could imagine seeing.' He said it is possible that he has seen evidence of war crimes in these referrals, along with evidence of 'other international crimes'. So what kind of help does Ukraine want?  The main request coming from Ukraine now is for more money. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the World Bank and IMF that the country needs $7 billion (PS5.4 billion) per month to supplement its losses caused by Russia. It comes after the country has already suffered around $60 billion (PS46.6 billion) in physical damage from the Russian invasion. He explained: 'We will need hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild all this later and recover from this war.' The Ukrainian president also called for Russia to be excluded from the World Bank and IMF, saying such bodies are 'definitely not the place for a country which is trying to ruin the lives of its neighbours'. Ukraine used to want to join Nato so that its forces would help defend the country, but it has since abandoned this effort. In mid-March, Zelenskyy said: 'Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand that. We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join. It's a truth and it must be recognised.' Ukraine used to plead for a no-fly zone, but to the country's disappointment, this was rejected by the west over fears it would be seen as an escalation of tensions with Russia and officially pull Nato into the war. Instead, Zelenskyy now asks for weapons which are 'comparable' with Moscow's, including fighter jets. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boychenko, has also called for more humanitarian corridors, explaining: 'We need only one thing - the full evacuation of the population. About 100,000 people remain in Mariupol.' So what is the west actually doing? The UK supplied Kyiv with 4,000 anti-tank weapons and anti-tank Javelin missiles, while another batch of 6,000 firearms is on its way now. Around PS25 million in financial support was announced in March, along with body armour, helmets and combat boots. The US and the EU have pledged to send more weapons, while France has sent PS83 million worth of equipment. Canada, Norway and even Sweden - famously neutral - have chipped in too to support Ukraine with weapons. Since Zelenskyy's plea, the US has promised to pass an extra $800 million (PS615 million) to supply Ukraine with more equipment, ammunition and drones while. The UK is now training some Ukrainian soldiers to use armoured vehicles. Boris Johnson said earlier this week: 'They need support with more artillery, that is what we will be giving them.' Why stop there? The west has been extremely reluctant to interfere with the war out of fear that the war would escalate. But, critics claim what Ukraine's allies have offered so far is simply not enough. Tory MP Tobias Ellwood told Radio 4's Today programme: 'The bigger question, not answered by Nato or indeed us, is what does success look like? 'We are doing enough to prevent Ukraine from losing but not enough to ensure they win. 'So what does our long-term mission objective look like? Is it pushing Russia back to pre-February lines or is it liberating the entire Donbas region? That's absolutely critical in how we choose to up-arm the Ukrainians.' He said there was an 'absence of overall strategy' on how to end the war from Nato, and warned that he believes Putin will not stop his attack unless he is stopped. Now more than five million Ukrainian refugees have now fled from the country, primarily to the rest of Europe, there is also an argument that the west is already involved. Russian propagandists have already claimed that 'World War 3' has started and that Russia is 'fighting Nato'. The Kremlin has even warned Washington recently that continued military aid could lead to 'unpredictable consequences'. Former vice chief of staff at Nato's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), Michel Yakovleff, also called for the west to take further action this week. Asked if the west has done enough to help Ukraine, he told French broadcaster France24: 'Very bluntly, and that is my personal opinion, no, not since 2014. 'Ukraine is paying now for our desire not to escalate since 2014.' He said that while the UK and the US' actions now 'have helped massively', the influx of new materials has come at a time when both sides are exhausted. 'Will Ukraine have time to integrate this new equipment before utter exhaustion? I don't know.' He concluded that Nato, which calls itself the 'most powerful alliance in history', should not be 'frightened' of Putin and 'cower' in the face of the potential 'consequences'.",

    "82d3716dc6db88a0cb7008aaf0e37e4fbc88f6815c11f3b7accfe340": "Jacob Rees-Mogg has been labelled a 'nasty patronising man' after reportedly leaving notes on the desks of civil servants who were not in the office. The government efficiency minister is leading efforts for a 'rapid return' of officials to their Whitehall desks after working from home became the norm during the pandemic. In a letter to cabinet ministers this week, Rees-Mogg argued that the return to in-person working would bring the benefits of 'face-to-face, collaborative working' as well as delivering wider benefits for the economy. On Friday, podcast producer Dino Sofos posted a picture on Twitter of an official-looking note apparently authored by Rees-Mogg, who is also minister for Brexit opportunities. It read: 'Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon. Wish every good wish.' The alleged note caused an exasperated response on social media, with some pointing out the officials may have been away from their desk briefly (like Rees-Mogg himself) and that the WFH crackdown could prompt people to quit in favour of the private sector. Labour MP Chris Bryant wrote: 'What a nasty patronising man he is.' With up to three-quarters of staff still reportedly working from home, Rees-Mogg accompanied his letter with a league table showing how many staff in each government department were attending the office on an average day. The drive has been branded 'vindictive' by Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA representing senior civil servants, who said ministers were out of step with practice in the private sector.",
    "776fff0debcdf58ae3a452e17e299bc479f0e270f2c352e650caec95": "Nadine Dorries has done it again. The culture secretary prompted ridicule after featuring in a fellow Tory MP's TikTok to explain her job. But her phrasing raised a few quizzical eyebrows, and lent weight to the suggestion she struggles to fully grasp her brief. In the clip shared by Luke Evans, she says the department of culture, media and sport is responsible for broadband, which means 'you can downstream your movies' at home. People typically download movies. One of her goals is to 'make the internet in the UK the safest internet in the world'. The internet doesn't really have national boundaries. Dorries also fronts the Whitehall department in charge of sport, which involves 'tennis pitches' (they're usually referred to as courts), which is one of the places where you can 'exercise your sports'. Not bad for 42 seconds of work. Social media could not resist. It's not the first time questions have been raised about whether Dorries is cut out for the job.  In November, she didn't seem to know how Channel 4 - which the government wants to privatise - is funded.  It does not receive public funding but is ultimately owned by the state, with all the money it makes from advertising going back into the broadcaster.   But the culture secretary claimed the broadcaster was in 'receipt of public money'.   It was also reported in March that she asked Microsoft executives when they were going to 'get rid' of its algorithms. The Politico report also claimed Dorries mentioned the same issue again 'in a separate stakeholders meeting'.",
